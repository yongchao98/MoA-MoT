    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-protons (between the two ester groups) are highly acidic. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), will deprotonate it to form the nucleophilic enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Deprotonation):** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an intermediate enolate.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (A):**\n    The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    The resulting structure is:\n    `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH(β)-CH₂(α)-COOCH₃`\n                   `|`\n                 `CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n    Let's analyze the name given in the options: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with:\n    *   Two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n    *   A p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group on C3 (as part of a -CH₂COOCH₃ group).\n    The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`. This structure perfectly matches the product derived from the reaction mechanism. Thus, the name for A is correct.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition where an enamine serves as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Enamine):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is the enamine of cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the one that was α to the carbonyl in cyclohexanone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (B):**\n    The reaction results in a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent comes from but-2-enenitrile, attaching via its β-carbon. The substituent group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    The systematic name for this compound is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, treating the nitrile as the principal functional group. The keto form (`=O`) is the major product after aqueous acid workup, not the enol form (`-OH`).\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type (Retrosynthesis):** This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Base:** KOH.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic α-carbon of the donor and the electrophilic β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   In the product, the substituent is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This group is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK, after the addition and protonation. The C-C bond was formed at the start of this chain (the first `-CH₂-`).\n    *   This group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The C2 position is highly acidic as it is between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the bond formed was between C2 of the donor and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the Michael donor was the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, formed by deprotonation with KOH.\n\n3.  **Structure of Reactant (C):**\n    The starting material (C) that forms this enolate is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A=correct, B=correct, C=incorrect\n*   B) A=incorrect, B=incorrect, C=incorrect\n*   C) A=incorrect, B=incorrect, C=correct\n*   D) A=correct, B=correct, C=correct\n\nOption D correctly identifies all reactants and products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
