    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the directing effects of substituents.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) and the overall reaction rate.\n\nSubstituents are classified as:\n1.  **Activating, ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Examples are alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5).\n2.  **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Examples are -NO2, -COOH, -COOR.\n3.  **Deactivating, ortho-, para-directing groups:** Halogens (-Cl) are an exception. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal but are ortho-, para-directing because their lone pairs can participate in resonance, stabilizing the intermediates for ortho and para substitution.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents for each substance.**\n\n*   1) **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   2) **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n*   3) **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   4) **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n*   5) **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   6) **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the substances into two main categories based on expected para-isomer yield.**\n\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** These will produce very little para-isomer. This group includes Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), and Benzoic acid (6).\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho-, para-directors):** These will produce significant amounts of para-isomer. This group includes Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho-, para-directors.\nOrder: {4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the low para-yield (meta-directing) group.**\n\nThe substituents are -NO2 (4), -COOH (6), and -COOC2H5 (2). The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. The stronger the deactivation, the more substitution is forced to the meta position and the lower the yield at the ortho and para positions.\nThe order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5.\nTherefore, the nitro group will give the lowest percentage of the para-isomer. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, they are very similar, but typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating.\nExperimental data for a similar reaction (nitration) shows the following para-isomer yields:\n*   Nitrobenzene (4): ~0.3% para\n*   Benzoic acid (6): ~2% para\n*   Ethyl benzoate (2): ~4% para\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Order the substances within the high para-yield (ortho-, para-directing) group.**\n\nThe substituents are -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3). The ratio of para to ortho product is determined by a balance of electronic and steric effects.\n*   **Steric hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. The steric bulk increases in the order: -Cl ≈ -CH3 < -C2H5.\n*   **Electronic effects:**\n    *   Alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5) are activating.\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall due to induction but directs ortho/para due to resonance. The strong inductive withdrawal by chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position, which enhances the preference for para substitution compared to alkyl groups of similar size.\n\nBased on experimental data for bromination:\n*   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** Yields about 67% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The bulkier ethyl group provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions compared to the methyl group, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer. The yield is about 77% para.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Due to the combination of steric and electronic effects, the para-isomer is highly favored. The yield is about 87% para.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the orders of the two groups.**\n\nCombining the order from Step 4 and Step 5:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
