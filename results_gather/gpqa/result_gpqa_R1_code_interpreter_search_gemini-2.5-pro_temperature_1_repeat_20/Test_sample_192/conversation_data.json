    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We are given how the number of stars (`N`) changes with parallax (`plx`), specifically the rate `dN/d(plx)`. We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`), which is the rate `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:** The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is that they are inversely proportional.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is the distance to the star.\n\n3.  **State the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is the number density with respect to parallax. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Transformation:** To convert the derivative from being with respect to `plx` to being with respect to `r`, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the known parts back into the chain rule equation. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can ignore the constant of proportionality and the negative sign (as the number of stars in a positive distance interval must be positive). We are concerned with the magnitude of the relationship.\n    *   From step 3: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   From step 5: `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r² = r⁻²`\n\n    Substitute these into the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (r⁻²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:** The final expression should only involve `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r` again.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    Now substitute this back into our expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes in proportion to `r³`.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
