    "This problem requires us to deduce the components of a 1:1 mixture by analyzing its combined 1H NMR spectrum and comparing it to the expected spectra of four possible aromatic compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute one singlet to the aromatic region, and the number of protons giving rise to each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each candidate compound:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. A horizontal and a vertical plane of symmetry pass through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H). This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They are meta to each other, so any coupling would be very small, and they appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (a 3H signal).\n        All methyls are attached to carbons with no protons, so all signals are **singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signal, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will be a **quartet (4H)** due to coupling with the adjacent CH3. The two CH3 groups are equivalent and will be a **triplet (6H)** due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture of the Remaining Candidates**\n\nBy elimination, the mixture must contain **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, these will appear as **two singlets** at slightly different chemical shifts, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of their integrations will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's sum the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = **24H total**.\n    *   The problem states there are three signals in a **2:1:1** ratio. Let's find the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n        *   Protons per part = 24H / 4 = 6H.\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n    *   Now, let's see if our two compounds can produce these signals (12H, 6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one signal: a **12H singlet**. This matches Signal 1.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three signals: a 6H singlet, a 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n        *   The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB can be Signal 2.\n        *   For Signal 3 (6H), the two separate 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB must have the same chemical shift (be \"accidentally isochronous\") and overlap to appear as a single 6H singlet.\n    *   This combination perfectly accounts for the three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
