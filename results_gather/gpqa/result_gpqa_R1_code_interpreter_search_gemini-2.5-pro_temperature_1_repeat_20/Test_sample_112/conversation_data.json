    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids (-COOH). Alcohols also show O-H stretching, but it's typically less broad unless there is significant intermolecular H-bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. It is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of the alkene group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ion, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The observation of a fragment with m/z = 45 provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have definitively identified two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n    *   We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C of the alkene. So, we are looking for a formula with **DoU = 2**.\n\n5.  **Calculate DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For C (C6H12O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A DoU of 1 means there is only one double bond or ring. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n    *   **For A (C6H10O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens, part of the DoU), and an alkene group (part of the DoU), resulting in a total DoU of 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
