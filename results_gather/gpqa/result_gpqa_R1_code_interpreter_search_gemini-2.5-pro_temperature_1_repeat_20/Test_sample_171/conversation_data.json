    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### 1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (`N`) in two different energy states (`i` and `j`):\n\n`N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N_i`, `N_j` are the number of atoms in states `i` and `j`.\n*   `g_i`, `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n*   `E_i`, `E_j` are the energies of the states.\n*   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, we are comparing the number of atoms in a specific excited energy level (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`). Let's denote the excited state as `i` and the ground state as `0`. The energy difference is given as `ΔE = E_i - E_0 = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n\n### 2. Set up the Equations for Each Star\n\nWe can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, assuming they are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n*   **For star_1 (temperature T_1):**\n    The ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms is:\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n\n*   **For star_2 (temperature T_2):**\n    The ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms is:\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n### 3. Use the Given Observational Data\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n\nMathematically:\n`(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from the Boltzmann equation into this relationship:\n\n`(g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]`\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, `(g_excited / g_ground)`, is a constant for this specific energy level transition and cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nTo isolate the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation by dividing both sides by `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2`\n\nUsing the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2`\n`exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) ] = 2`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2`\n\nTake the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n### 5. Substitute the Given Values\n\nThe problem provides:\n*   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n*   Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\nThe ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore:\n`ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\nSubstitute this value back into our equation:\n\n`1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nNow, combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n`1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nSo, the final relationship is:\n\n`ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n### 6. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nB) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nOur derived equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
