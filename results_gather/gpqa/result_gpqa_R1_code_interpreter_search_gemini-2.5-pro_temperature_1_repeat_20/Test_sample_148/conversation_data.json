    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that spin-spin coupling is ruled out means these two environments are not due to coupling with adjacent protons. The slow exchange on the NMR timescale between these two environments causes separate signals instead of a single, averaged signal. The roughly equal integrals suggest that the two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into its components. The presence of two clearly defined peaks shows that there are two distinct chemical species that can be separated under the given conditions. The mass spectrometry (MS) data is crucial: both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. This confirms that the two species are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass) and not an impurity like a precursor or a side-product with a different mass. The use of elevated temperature in LC-MS is a common technique to improve peak shape or separation and suggests that the two species might be interconvertible conformers.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options in the Context of a Peptide:**\n    *   **C) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) cannot be distinguished by standard 1H NMR (in an achiral solvent) or by standard LC (on an achiral column). They would produce a single peak in both analyses. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) Contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the target molecule. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling':** This is a procedural term in peptide synthesis (performing the coupling step twice to drive the reaction to completion). It does not describe a type of molecule or isomerism and cannot explain the analytical data. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **A) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties, and therefore they can be separated by LC and will have distinct NMR spectra. The observations fit this description perfectly.\n\n*   **Identifying the Specific Type of Diastereomerism:** In peptides, a very common phenomenon that explains these exact observations is restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond, rotation is slow, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers (rotamers).\n    *   These *cis/trans* isomers are a specific type of diastereomer because they have a different spatial arrangement of atoms at the amide bond relative to the pre-existing chiral centers (the alpha-carbons of the amino acids).\n    *   The alpha-proton of the residue following the amide bond is in a very different chemical environment in the *cis* versus the *trans* conformation, leading to two separate NMR signals.\n    *   These diastereomeric rotamers can often be separated by LC.\n    *   The observation of a ~1:1 ratio is particularly common for amide bonds preceding a proline residue, where the energies of the *cis* and *trans* forms are very similar.\n\nTherefore, the presence of two species with the same mass, which are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR, points directly to a mixture of diastereomers. The most likely cause in this peptidic context is the presence of *cis/trans* rotamers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
