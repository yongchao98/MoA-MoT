    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample compartment under ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr).\n    *   **Constant:** The number density and type of residual gas molecules, and the temperature of the compartment, are constant throughout the scenario.\n    *   **λ₁:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ₂:** The mean free path of the electrons from the TEM's beam. This describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   **Question:** How does λ₂ compare to λ₁?\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a moving particle sees for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   **For λ₁ (molecule-molecule collisions):**\n        *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n        *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for a molecule hitting another molecule, let's call it `σ_molecule-molecule` or `σ₁`.\n        *   So, `λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁)`. (Note: A more precise formula includes a √2 factor, `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ₁)`, to account for the fact that the target molecules are also moving. However, this factor doesn't change the fundamental comparison).\n\n    *   **For λ₂ (electron-molecule collisions):**\n        *   The moving particles are electrons.\n        *   The target particles are the gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is the same `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a molecule, let's call it `σ_electron-molecule` or `σ₂`.\n        *   So, `λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂):**\n    *   This is the critical part of the problem. The relationship between λ₁ and λ₂ is inversely determined by the relationship between σ₁ and σ₂.\n    *   `σ₁` (molecule-molecule): This collision is essentially a \"billiard ball\" type of interaction. It's governed by the physical size of the molecules and the short-range van der Waals forces. For a collision to happen, the centers of the two molecules must come within a distance roughly equal to the sum of their radii. The cross-section is related to the physical dimensions of the molecule, approximately πd², where d is the molecular diameter.\n    *   `σ₂` (electron-molecule): This is not a simple physical collision. The electron is a point-like charged particle. The gas molecule, while electrically neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. This creates an electric field around the molecule. The incoming beam electron interacts with this electric field via the long-range Coulomb force. The electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even if it passes quite far from the \"physical edge\" of the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the Coulomb interaction is long-range, an electron is \"aware\" of the molecule's presence from a much larger distance compared to another neutral molecule. This means the effective target area the molecule presents to an electron (`σ₂`) is significantly larger than the effective target area it presents to another molecule (`σ₁`).\n    *   Therefore, `σ₂ > σ₁`.\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:**\n    *   We have the two equations:\n        *   `λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁)`\n        *   `λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)`\n    *   We have established that the number density `n_gas` is the same in both cases.\n    *   We have deduced that `σ₂ > σ₁`.\n    *   Since the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the cross-section `σ`, a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Because `σ₂` is larger than `σ₁`, it must follow that `λ₂` is smaller than `λ₁`.\n    *   `λ₂ < λ₁`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: This matches our conclusion.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics predicts a difference.\n    *   C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Predicts λ₂ is larger than λ₁.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Predicts λ₂ is larger than λ₁. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
