    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Moles of H+ = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely to give two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+) will react completely with the strong base (OH-).\nReaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   The H+ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H+ will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\nReaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH3COOH will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-), which will determine the pH.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n    *   500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n\n*   **pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
