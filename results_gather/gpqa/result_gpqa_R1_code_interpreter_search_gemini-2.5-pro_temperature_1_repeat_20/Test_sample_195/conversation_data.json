    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a relativistic system with a conservative force, the total energy of the system is conserved. This total energy is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the components of the total energy.**\n    *   **Relativistic Energy of the Particle:** The total energy of a particle with mass `m` and velocity `v` is given by `E_particle = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. This energy includes the rest energy `mc^2`.\n    *   **Potential Energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy `U(x)` is found by integrating the force: `U(x) = -∫ F dx = ∫ kx dx = (1/2)kx^2`. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position, `U(0) = 0`.\n\n3.  **Write the expression for the conserved total energy of the system.**\n    The total conserved energy `E_total` is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    `E_total = γmc^2 + U(x) = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2`\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points of the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (x = A).**\n        At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is `v = 0`.\n        The Lorentz factor `γ` becomes:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1`\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        `E_total = (1)mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position (x = 0).**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero (`U(0) = 0`), and the speed is maximum (`v = v_max`).\n        The Lorentz factor at this speed is `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        `E_total = γ_max * mc^2 + (1/2)k(0)^2 = γ_max * mc^2`\n\n5.  **Equate the energies at the two points.**\n    Since total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position:\n    `mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γ_max * mc^2`\n\n6.  **Solve the equation for v_max.**\n    *   First, isolate `γ_max`:\n        `γ_max = (mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2) / (mc^2)`\n        `γ_max = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n        `1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\n    *   Invert both sides to solve for the square root term:\n        `sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))`\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        `1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max^2/c^2`:\n        `v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by `c^2` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n        `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for `v_max` is:\n    `v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n    This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
