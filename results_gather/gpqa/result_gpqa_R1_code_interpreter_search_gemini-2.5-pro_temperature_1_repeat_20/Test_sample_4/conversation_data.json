    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$. Let's write them down using the standard Pauli matrices notation.\n    The Pauli matrices are:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$. So, $\\vec{P} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle, $\\theta$, which is the angle it makes with the positive z-axis. The components of this unit vector are:\n    $n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n    $n_y = 0$\n    $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, the vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\n    Now, let's write this in matrix form:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta - 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    \n    Now, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into our equation:\n    $b \\cdot (2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)) = a \\cdot (2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n\n    Assuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    This relationship tells us that the eigenvector must be of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = k \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $k$. (We can verify this solution in the second equation as well, and it holds).\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n    For a quantum state, the eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) is 1.\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$\n    Substituting $a = k \\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $b = k \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $|k|^2 \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + |k|^2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|k|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    $|k|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |k| = 1$\n\n    We can choose the simplest phase factor, $k=1$.\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$. This corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   A) and B) are incorrect because they contain $\\hbar$, and eigenvectors are state vectors which are dimensionless.\n*   D) is a general form for a qubit state, but for a vector in the x-z plane, the phase factor $\\phi$ is 0, and the dependence is on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n*   C) matches our derived result perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
