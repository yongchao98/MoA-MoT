    "This question explores a hypothetical modification to Maxwell's equations, which are the fundamental equations of classical electromagnetism. Let's break down the standard equations and see how they would change with the introduction of magnetic monopoles.\n\n### Standard Maxwell's Equations\n\nIn our universe, magnetic poles always come in pairs (North and South). There are no isolated magnetic charges, or \"magnetic monopoles\". This is reflected in the standard form of Maxwell's equations:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀\n    *   **Meaning:** The divergence (flux per unit volume) of the electric field (**E**) is proportional to the electric charge density (ρ). This means electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges.\n    *   **Relevance:** This equation is about *electric* charges.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n    *   **Meaning:** The divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero.\n    *   **Relevance:** This is the mathematical statement that there are **no magnetic monopoles**. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops; they don't start or end anywhere.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n    *   **Meaning:** The curl (circulation per unit area) of the electric field is caused by a time-varying magnetic field.\n    *   **Relevance:** This describes how a changing magnetic field creates an electric field.\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)\n    *   **Meaning:** The curl of the magnetic field is caused by electric currents (**J**) and by time-varying electric fields.\n    *   **Relevance:** This describes how electric currents and changing electric fields create a magnetic field.\n\n### Introducing Magnetic Monopoles\n\nNow, let's imagine a universe where isolated North and South poles (magnetic monopoles) can exist. This is equivalent to saying there is a \"magnetic charge,\" let's call its density ρ_m.\n\n1.  **Change to Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**\n    *   The equation ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0 explicitly forbids magnetic monopoles. If they existed, they would be sources of the magnetic field, just as electric charges are sources of the electric field.\n    *   By symmetry with Gauss's Law for electricity, this equation would change to: **∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρ_m** (or some constant times ρ_m).\n    *   Therefore, the equation related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change.\n\n2.  **Change to Faraday's Law of Induction:**\n    *   If magnetic charges can exist, they can also move. A moving magnetic charge would constitute a \"magnetic current,\" let's call its density **J**_m.\n    *   Look at the symmetry in the equations. The Ampère-Maxwell law shows that an *electric* current (**J**) creates a circulating *magnetic* field (∇ × **B**). By symmetry, a *magnetic* current (**J**_m) should create a circulating *electric* field (∇ × **E**).\n    *   Therefore, Faraday's Law must be modified to include this new source term: **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m**.\n    *   Therefore, the equation related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field** must also change.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two equations that would be different in a universe with magnetic monopoles are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**, which deals with the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction**, which deals with the **circulation of the electric field**.\n\nThis corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
