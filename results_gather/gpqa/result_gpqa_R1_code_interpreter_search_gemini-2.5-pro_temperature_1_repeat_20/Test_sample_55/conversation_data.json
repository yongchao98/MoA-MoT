    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a hydrogen atom initially in the state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the $3s$ state.\n    *   It decays to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, which is the $1s$ ground state.\n    *   The decay happens via *two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions*. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n    *   The task is to identify a valid transition route (the sequence of states) and the probability of the atom taking that specific route.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an E1 transition from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following rules must be satisfied:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$ (The orbital angular momentum must change by 1). This also means parity must change.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$ (The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1).\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so the final state must have lower energy. Since energy $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, this means $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{1st transition}} |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{2nd transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying selection rules for the intermediate state:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_i - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_i = 1$. The intermediate state must be a $p$-orbital.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_i$ can be $0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n            *   $\\Delta n = n_i - 3 < 0 \\implies n_i$ can be 2 or 1. However, if $n_i=1$, then $l_i$ must be 0, which contradicts $l_i=1$. Therefore, the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n_i=2$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate states of the $2p$ subshell: $|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Final state: $n'=1, l'=0, m'=0$.\n        *   Let's check if the intermediate states we found can decay to this final state:\n            *   Intermediate state: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$. So $l_i=1$.\n            *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = 0 - m_i$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_i$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is consistent with the possible values for $m_i$.\n        *   Conclusion: All three states ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) are valid intermediate states. The decay path is $3s \\to 2p \\to 1s$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. Let's consider the route given in option A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability of this specific cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step:\n    $P(\\text{Route A}) = BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step ($3s \\to 2p$):**\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means there is no preferred direction in space.\n        *   The three possible final states for this transition, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy and only differ by their spatial orientation.\n        *   Because the initial state has no preferred orientation, the atom must decay into each of the three $m_i$ states with equal probability.\n        *   Therefore, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three channels.\n        *   $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Similarly, $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step ($2p \\to 1s$):**\n        *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find the probability it decays to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   We must consider all possible decay channels from the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state.\n        *   Applying the selection rules, the only possible lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta n = -1$). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is forbidden because it does not involve a change in parity ($2p$ and $2s$ have different parity, so $\\Delta l = -1$ seems to hold, but this transition's energy is very small and it's not the primary decay channel. The primary decay is always to the lowest possible energy level, which is $n=1$).\n        *   Since $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only significant decay channel for the $2p$ state, the branching ratio is essentially 1.\n        *   $BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for Route A:**\n        *   $P(\\text{Route A}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n        *   The route is valid, and the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option is correct.\n    *   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n        *   The route is valid, but its probability is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n        *   The route is valid, but its probability is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n        *   The probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that presents a valid physical process with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
