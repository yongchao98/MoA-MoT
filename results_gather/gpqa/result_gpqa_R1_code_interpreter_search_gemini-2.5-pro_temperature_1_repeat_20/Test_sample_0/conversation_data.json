    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that it is impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and its exact lifetime simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (the time uncertainty).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n2.  **Interpret \"Lifetime\" and \"Uncertainty\":** The lifetime of a quantum state (τ) is the time uncertainty (Δt). A finite lifetime means the energy of the state is not perfectly sharp but is \"smeared out\" over a range of energies. This \"smearing\" or \"broadening\" is the energy uncertainty, ΔE. We can approximate the minimum uncertainty as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Interpret \"Clearly Distinguish/Resolve\":** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguishable or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy uncertainties. If the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two \"smeared\" energy levels will overlap too much to be told apart. The primary limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy uncertainty, which corresponds to the state with the *shorter* lifetime.\n\n4.  **Identify the Limiting Factor:**\n    *   State 1: Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   State 2: Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    Since τ1 < τ2, State 1 has a shorter lifetime. Therefore, it will have a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1 > ΔE2) and will be the main bottleneck for resolving the two levels.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for the Limiting State:**\n    We need to calculate ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. This is the most convenient unit for this problem.\n\n    ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Apply the Resolution Condition:**\n    To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the energy broadening of the wider level, ΔE1.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option D provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the calculated energy uncertainty of the broader state. This large separation ensures that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Calculation using Python\nTo verify the calculation:\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state in eV\n# The formula is delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (lifetime {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (lifetime {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be larger than the uncertainties, primarily the larger one.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum required energy separation is on the order of {delta_E1:.2e} eV.\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-8, 'B': 1e-11, 'C': 1e-9, 'D': 1e-4}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is large enough for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is NOT large enough for resolution.\")\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (lifetime 1e-09 s): 6.58e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (lifetime 1e-08 s): 6.58e-08 eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be larger than the uncertainties, primarily the larger one.\nThe minimum required energy separation is on the order of 6.58e-07 eV.\n\nComparing with the options:\nOption A) 1.0e-08 eV is NOT large enough for resolution.\nOption B) 1.0e-11 eV is NOT large enough for resolution.\nOption C) 1.0e-09 eV is NOT large enough for resolution.\nOption D) 1.0e-04 eV is large enough for resolution.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
    "The reasoning and calculation are complete.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Principle:** The energy-time uncertainty principle (ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2) dictates that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE).\n2.  **Calculation:** We can estimate this minimum energy width as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime.\n3.  **Lifetimes:**\n    *   State 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   State 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n4.  **Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ/τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ/τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n5.  **Resolution Condition:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), which is the limiting factor. Therefore, the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be significantly greater than ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n6.  **Evaluating Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option D provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two levels, as it is much greater than the energy uncertainty of the broader state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
