    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino\n\nThe highest priority group is the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure of the Molecule\n\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the positional information provided.\n\n*   **-COOH is at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, which is named 'formyl' as a substituent) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this arrangement works.\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl group (-OH) and the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at positions C2 and C6.\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it. Positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's combine these facts to resolve the ambiguities (which group is at C3/C5 and which is at C2/C6):\n\n*   We know the cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   Since the methoxy group at C4 is ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at either **C3** or **C5**. This is consistent.\n*   Now, consider the hydroxyl group. It must be ortho to the cyano group.\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the C1-COOH (i.e., at C2 or C6), the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the C1-COOH (i.e., at C2 or C6), the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**.\n\nThese two cases actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from two different directions. IUPAC numbering rules will determine which is the correct way to number the ring. Let's write down the structure based on Case 1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl, since CN is at C3)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, since OH is at C2)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe have established the connections, but we need to confirm the numbering. We must number the ring starting from C1 (-COOH) in the direction that gives the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n\n*   **Numbering clockwise (as built in Case 1):** The substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** This would correspond to Case 2. The substituents would be at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n\nSince the set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is the same for both directions, we must use the next rule: give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically.\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino (Note: \"dimethylamino\" is a single substituent name and is alphabetized under 'd')\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n*   In the clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n*   In the counter-clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct assignment of locants is:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow, we write the full IUPAC name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituent names)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect, substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.** This matches our derived name exactly.\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n\n<<<C>>>"
