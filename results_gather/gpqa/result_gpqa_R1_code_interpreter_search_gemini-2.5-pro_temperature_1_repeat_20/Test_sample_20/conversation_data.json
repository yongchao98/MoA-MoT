    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n        *   The structure has three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens).\n        *   The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can convert to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, so the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone)**:\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) are C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n        *   However, all carbons in the ring are sp² hybridized. There are no sp³ hybridized α-carbons with α-hydrogens, which is the typical requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   While benzoquinone can be converted to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), this is a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction, not tautomerism, because the molecular formula changes (benzoquinone is C₆H₄O₂). Tautomers must have the same molecular formula.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n    4.  **Result for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   The four groups attached to C2 are:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, C2 is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the arrangement around the C=C double bond is *trans*.\n        *   The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral centers).\n        *   The molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **Result for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
