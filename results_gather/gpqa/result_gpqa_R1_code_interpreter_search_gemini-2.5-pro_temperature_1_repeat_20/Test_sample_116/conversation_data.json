    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), but it can also arise from axial, planar, or helical chirality, where the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings, i.e., 2, 6, 2', and 6'), free rotation around the central C-C bond can be restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks them into a twisted conformation.\n    *   To be chiral, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. Because the substituents at position 2 (-COOCH3) and position 6 (-NO2) on each ring are different, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. It is chiral due to atropisomerism and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's analyze the carbon atoms.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to check for a chiral center. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the central carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are optically active. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and thus not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
