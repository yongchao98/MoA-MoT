    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. The construction of SMEFT is based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry of quantum field theory and the Standard Model. SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations). Thus, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is the full group of spacetime symmetries in special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations (item 1) as well as spacetime translations. The Lagrangian of any local quantum field theory, including SMEFT, is required to be invariant under Poincaré transformations. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry, as observed in the weak interactions (e.g., through the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it not only incorporates the SM's CP violation but can also introduce new sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, CP is *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
