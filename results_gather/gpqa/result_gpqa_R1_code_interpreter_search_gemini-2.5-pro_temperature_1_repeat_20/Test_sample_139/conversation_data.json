    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to identify the substances involved.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This is a strong hint towards isotopic labeling, most commonly with Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This suggests a highly exothermic reaction, typical of strong reducing agents, alkali metals, or metal hydrides with a protic substance like water.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, and its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. This fits perfectly with Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.\n        *   Given Clue 1, D₂ is the most probable candidate for gas W.\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G is formed.** The reaction produces an insoluble solid.\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B.** This means G decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has two oxygen-containing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For the final product to have only two oxygens, both groups must have been reduced to alcohols (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Clue 8: Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points to a common laboratory chemical.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   From Clues 3 & 6, we have identified **W = D₂** and **B = D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is released from heating G, and the overall reaction involves deuterium, G must be a deuteroxide compound that dehydrates (or \"de-deuterates\") upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n`.\n    *   Let's test a hypothesis. The \"very close analog\" (Clue 8) of a common strong reducing agent (Clue 7) is a good starting point. The most common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (Clue 1) would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Now, let's see if this hypothesis fits all other clues.\n        *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts extremely violently with water. So, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume **Y = D₂O**. The reaction would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes.\n        *   **Releases gas W (D₂)?** Yes.\n        *   **Forms precipitate G?** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, aluminium deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would also be a precipitate. This fits perfectly. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   **Heating G releases B (D₂O)?** The decomposition of aluminium hydroxide is `2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`. So, the decomposition of G would be `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This also fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid?** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid `R-C(=O)-COOH` would be reduced to a diol `R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`. This final product contains exactly **two oxygen atoms**. This fits Clue 7 perfectly.\n    *   The hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** is consistent with every single clue provided.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The question specifies: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This is a key instruction.\n    *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are 4 instances (four D atoms). We must sum their masses.\n    *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is 1 instance.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for the calculation, as is standard for this type of problem and because the answers are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 aluminium atom. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total cumulative mass:** Sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
