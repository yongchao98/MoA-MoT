    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, suggesting a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** A 3H singlet at ~2.1 ppm is a classic signature for the methyl group in an acetate functional group (-O-CO-C**H₃**). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Alkene and Alkyl Signals:**\nThe remaining signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must describe the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part of the molecule.\n*   **Propenyl group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (has 2 vinylic protons and 3 allylic protons)\n*   **Butenyl group:** Would have one more carbon and two more protons (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ or -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃). The number of signals and their integrations do not match a butenyl structure. For example, a but-1-enyl group would show signals for an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet), which are not present. A but-2-enyl group attached to the oxygen via a CH₂ (crotyl acetate) would show a CH₂ signal around 4.5 ppm. Therefore, we can rule out the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n\nThis leaves us with **Cis-propenyl acetate** and **Trans-propenyl acetate**. The general structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. Let's assign the remaining protons to this structure.\n\n**Structure:** C**H₃**(c)-C**H**(b)=C**H**(a)-O-CO-CH₃\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This is a single vinylic proton (**H**(a)). Its downfield chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one other proton, which must be **H**(b).\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This is the other vinylic proton (**H**(b)).\n    *   Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet arises from coupling to **H**(a). The quartet arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, **CH₃**(c).\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   These are the three protons of the methyl group attached to the double bond (**CH₃**(c)).\n    *   This signal is a doublet (d) because the methyl group is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, **H**(b).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, **H**(a) and **H**(b).\n\n*   **Trans coupling:** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis coupling:** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**, which falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the stereochemistry of the double bond is trans. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
