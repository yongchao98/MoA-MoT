    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (Br), and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution via a benzyne intermediate. The mechanism has two main steps:\n    1.  **Elimination:** The strong base (amide ion, NH2-) abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n    2.  **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, another amide ion, NH2-) attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia) to give the final product.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-) can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of the two positions ortho to the bromine atom at C1: C2 (which has a deuterium) or C6 (which has a hydrogen). This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuteron (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH2- base removes the deuteron (D+) from the C2 position.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    5.  Crucially, since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting benzyne intermediate contains only hydrogen atoms (C6H4). Let's call this **Benzyne-H**.\n\n    `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2- removes D+ at C2)--> Benzyne-H (C6H4)`\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Proton (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH2- base removes the proton (H+) from the C6 position. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    5.  In this pathway, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. The resulting benzyne intermediate is therefore deuterated. Let's call this **Benzyne-D**. Relative to the triple bond (C1-C6), the deuterium is at the C2 position.\n\n    `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2- removes H+ at C6)--> Benzyne-D (C6H3D)`\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nNow, the nucleophile (NH2-) attacks each of these benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne-H (from Pathway A):**\n    1.  Benzyne-H (C6H4) is symmetrical. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2 of the benzyne triple bond. Both attacks lead to the same carbanion.\n    2.  The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent (NH3), which donates a proton (H+).\n    3.  The final product is **aniline (C6H5NH2)**. Since the starting benzyne had no deuterium, the final product has no deuterium.\n\n    `Benzyne-H + NH2- --> Aryl anion --> +NH3 --> Aniline`\n    This gives **Product 1: Aniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne-D (from Pathway B):**\n    1.  Benzyne-D is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    2.  **Attack at C1:**\n        *   The NH2- group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6.\n        *   This carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3). An H atom adds to C6.\n        *   The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium (D) at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    3.  **Attack at C6:**\n        *   The NH2- group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1.\n        *   This carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3). An H atom adds to C1.\n        *   The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium (D) at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    `Benzyne-D + NH2- --> two possible aryl anions --> +NH3 --> 2-deuteroaniline + 3-deuteroaniline`\n    This gives **Product 2: 2-Deuteroaniline** and **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
