    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion, which results in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups (OH) across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for addition reactions: A *trans*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition results in a *meso* compound (if the product has stereocenters and is symmetrical).\n    *   Mnemonic: **T**rans + **A**nti = **M**eso (TAM).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to yield meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. This reaction produces only **one** single, achiral product. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for a *cis*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition is the formation of a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Mnemonic: **C**is + **A**nti = **R**acemic (CAR).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to yield a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers. This reaction produces **two** different compounds which are mirror images of each other. Let's call them **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **M:** meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these three compounds:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R** (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n#### **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A standard HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like **R** and **S**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (e.g., same boiling point, same polarity). Therefore, they will not be separated by an achiral column and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like **M** and the pair **R/S**) have different physical properties and different polarities. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated, appearing as **different peaks**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks. One peak for the meso compound (**M**) and a second peak for the co-eluting enantiomers (**R** + **S**).\n*   **Total Peaks = 2**\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers can be distinguished. The chiral stationary phase will interact differently with each enantiomer (**R** and **S**), leading to different retention times. Therefore, **R** and **S** will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   The meso compound (**M**), being a diastereomer to both **R** and **S**, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a different time from both **R** and **S**. It will appear as its own peak.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** We will observe three separate peaks, one for each of the stereoisomers present in the mixture (**M**, **R**, and **S**).\n*   **Total Peaks = 3**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
