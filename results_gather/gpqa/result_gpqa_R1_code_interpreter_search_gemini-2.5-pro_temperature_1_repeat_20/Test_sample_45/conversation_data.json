    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction.**\n    *   The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" signifies a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The catalyst is Grubbs catalyst, which is used for olefin metathesis.\n    *   Since only one type of alkene is present (as a pair of enantiomers), the reaction is a self-metathesis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the general products of the self-metathesis reaction.**\n    *   Olefin metathesis of a terminal alkene (R-CH=CH₂) involves two molecules reacting to form a new internal alkene and ethene.\n    *   The general reaction is: 2 R-CH=CH₂ → R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene).\n    *   For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the \"R\" group is a *sec*-butyl group (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The reaction is: 2 CH₂(CH₃)CH-CH=CH₂ → CH₃CH₂(CH₃)CH-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃ + CH₂=CH₂.\n    *   The product we are interested in (excluding ethene) is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider the stereochemistry of the reaction.**\n    *   The starting material is a mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers. This means three different reaction pairings can occur in the reaction vessel:\n        1.  (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene\n        2.  (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene\n        3.  (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the stereoisomers formed from each pairing.**\n    *   The product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two stereocenters (at C3 and C6) and a double bond (at C4) that can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of the product from each of the three pairings.\n\n    *   **Pairing 1: (R) + (R)**\n        *   This reaction will produce 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene where both chiral centers have the (R) configuration. This is the (3R, 6R) isomer.\n        *   This can exist as two different geometric isomers (diastereomers) around the C4=C5 double bond:\n            *   Product 1: (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n            *   Product 2: (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **Pairing 2: (S) + (S)**\n        *   This reaction is the enantiomeric equivalent of the first pairing. It will produce the (3S, 6S) isomers, which are the enantiomers of the (3R, 6R) products.\n        *   This gives two new, distinct products:\n            *   Product 3: (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of Product 1)\n            *   Product 4: (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of Product 2)\n\n    *   **Pairing 3: (R) + (S)**\n        *   This is a cross-reaction between the two enantiomers. It will produce 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene with one (R) center and one (S) center, giving the (3R, 6S) configuration.\n        *   We must check for internal symmetry, which would make these meso compounds.\n        *   (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene: This molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral (a meso compound).\n        *   (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene: This molecule has a plane of symmetry, also making it achiral (a meso compound).\n        *   Note that (3R,6S) and (3S,6R) represent the same two meso compounds.\n        *   This pairing gives two more distinct products which are diastereomers of each other and of the chiral products above:\n            *   Product 5: (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n            *   Product 6: (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of distinct products.**\n    *   From (R)+(R): 2 chiral products.\n    *   From (S)+(S): 2 chiral products (the enantiomers of the first pair).\n    *   From (R)+(S): 2 achiral (meso) products.\n    *   All six of these stereoisomers are chemically distinct compounds. Therefore, the total number of possible products is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
