    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reactions.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n        *   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4-\n        *   Na2HPO4●2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O\n    *   The key species are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). These form a conjugate acid-base pair, creating a buffer solution.\n    *   The relevant equilibria for the phosphate system are the dissociations of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n        1.  H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4- (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n        2.  H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n        3.  HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n    *   The question asks for the concentration of \"orthophosphate ions,\" which is the PO4^3- ion. This ion is produced in the third dissociation step (governed by Ka3).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Since KH2PO4 dissociates completely, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Since Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is determined by the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- equilibrium (the second dissociation).\n    *   Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. We can assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations because the dissociation/association is small.\n    *   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    *   The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium.\n    *   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-], using the [H+] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n    *   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n    *   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   The calculated value, 6.236 x 10^-7 M, is closest to option A, 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00\nvolume_L = 0.20000\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Step 3: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.236e-07\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Components and Reactions:**\n    *   We have potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), the acid in our buffer system.\n    *   We have disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O), which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), the conjugate base.\n    *   The relevant equilibria are the dissociation steps of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n        *   H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻ (governed by Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n        *   HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻ (governed by Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n    *   The question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4³⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.

This gives 0.005618 moles of HPO4²⁻.\n    *   Initial concentration [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The solution is a buffer governed by the H2PO4⁻/HPO4²⁻ pair. We use the Ka2 expression to find the [H⁺].\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.114x10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4³⁻]:**\n    *   The concentration of PO4³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium.\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO4³⁻]: [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the [HPO4²⁻] and [H⁺] values we just determined.\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.114x10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236x10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A. The Python code execution confirmed this calculation, yielding `6.236e-07`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
