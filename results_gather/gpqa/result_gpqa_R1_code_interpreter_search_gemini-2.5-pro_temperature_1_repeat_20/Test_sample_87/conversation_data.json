    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Observation 1:** The antigen successfully reaches the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Observation 2:** In the Peyer's patches, a cell population is proliferating. This indicates an active immune response, specifically the clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Observation 3 (Key finding):** Sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells reveals \"high variability\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the question:** The core question is what process causes high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of B cells that are actively proliferating in a secondary lymphoid organ after encountering an antigen.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes and does not affect the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (antibodies) and T cell receptors. It occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during the development of *naive* lymphocytes, *before* they encounter an antigen. While it creates variability, it is not the process occurring in proliferating cells within a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* change the variable region, which determines antigen specificity. Therefore, it does not cause variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and differentiate (a process called affinity maturation). This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The scenario describes an ongoing adaptive immune response in a germinal center within a Peyer's patch. The finding of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
