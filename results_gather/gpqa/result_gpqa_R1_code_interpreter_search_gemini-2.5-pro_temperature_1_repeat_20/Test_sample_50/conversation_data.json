    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. The Method of Image Charges\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere. The electric field outside the sphere can be accurately described by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The real charge `q` plus this fictitious image charge `q'` must together produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (since it's grounded).\n\nLet's define:\n*   `R`: the radius of the conducting sphere.\n*   `q`: the real charge.\n*   `d`: the distance of the charge `q` from the center of the sphere.\n*   `q'`: the image charge.\n*   `b`: the distance of the image charge `q'` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nFor the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius R), the magnitude and position of the image charge must be:\n*   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n*   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere, while the sphere is held at a constant potential of zero.\n\nThe work done `U` is the integral of the external force `F_ext` required to move the charge. This external force is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_elec` exerted on the charge `q` by the sphere.\n`U = W_ext = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec(x) dx`\n\nThe electrostatic force on the charge `q` at any distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` (which depends on `x`).\n\nAt an arbitrary distance `x` for the charge `q`:\n*   The image charge's magnitude is `q'(x) = - (R/x) * q`\n*   The image charge's position is `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe distance between the real charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\nThe force on `q` is:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / [ (x^2 - R^2) / x ]^2`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * [ x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ]`\n`F_elec(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate this force to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [ - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use a u-substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ [ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx = ∫ [ 1 / u^2 ] * (du / 2) = (1/2) ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * [ u^(-1) / -1 ] = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we apply the limits of integration:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `x = ∞` to `x = d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nThe term with `∞` in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Alternative Method (Interaction Energy)\n\nA quicker method is to use the formula for the interaction energy of a charge with a conductor:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n`q' = - (R/d) * q`\n`b = R^2 / d`\nDistance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n`V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]`\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - Correct\n\n<<<D>>>"
