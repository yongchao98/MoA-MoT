    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Angular Distribution of Radiated Power**\n\n1.  **Model the Radiating System:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a \"symmetry axis along the z-axis\". This setup strongly suggests a system that can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. In the far-field (radiation zone), the radiation is dominated by the lowest-order non-vanishing multipole moment. For a simple oscillating charge distribution, this is typically the electric dipole moment. We assume the charge oscillates along the symmetry axis (z-axis), creating a dipole moment `p(t) = p_z(t)`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Radiation Formula:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation. The problem states this function is `f(λ, θ)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Maximum Power (A):** The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the equatorial plane).\n    `A = max(f) = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n    So, the maximum radiated power, `A`, is equal to the constant `C`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`. We use the same formula:\n    `f(at 30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Fraction:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power.\n    `Fraction = f(at 30°) / A = (C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Value:** We know the standard trigonometric value for `sin(30°)`.\n    `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    So, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**. This narrows the possible answers to options A and C.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\n1.  **Relate Power to Frequency:** The theory of electromagnetic radiation (specifically, the Larmor formula and its generalization to dipoles) shows that the total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω`).\n    `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n    The power per unit solid angle, `f = dP/dΩ`, also has the same dependence on frequency.\n    `f ∝ ω⁴`\n\n2.  **Relate Frequency to Wavelength:** The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula:\n    `ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, where `ν` is the frequency.\n    Substituting `ν = c/λ`, we get:\n    `ω = 2πc / λ`\n\n3.  **Determine Wavelength Dependence:** Now substitute the expression for `ω` into the power proportionality:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴`\n    Since `2πc` is a constant, the dependence of `f` on `λ` is:\n    `f ∝ 1/λ⁴` or `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   From Part 1, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   From Part 2, a possible form for the dependence of the radiated power `f` on the wavelength `λ` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we look for the option that has `1/4` and `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n*   A) 1/4, λ⁻³ (Incorrect wavelength dependence)\n*   B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴ (Incorrect fraction)\n*   C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴ (Correct)\n*   D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶ (Incorrect fraction and wavelength dependence; corresponds to electric quadrupole radiation, which is a less likely model for this general problem).\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
