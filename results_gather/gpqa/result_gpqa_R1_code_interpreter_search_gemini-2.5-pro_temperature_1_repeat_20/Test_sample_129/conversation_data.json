    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects is stretched to longer wavelengths. The relationship between the emitted (rest) wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) and the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is given by the formula:\n        $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line:** This is a specific spectral line of hydrogen with a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) in the far-ultraviolet region of the spectrum, approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm).\n    *   **Ground-based Optical Telescopes:** These telescopes observe from the Earth's surface. Their capability is limited by the Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This creates an \"atmospheric window\" for observation. Light with wavelengths shorter than a certain cutoff cannot reach ground-based telescopes. This cutoff is typically in the range of 3200 to 3500 Å (320-350 nm). For an object to be detected, its light must be redshifted enough to have an observed wavelength *longer* than this cutoff.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line: $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å.\n    *   We need to find the minimum redshift ($z_{\\text{min}}$) that will shift this line to a wavelength that is just observable from the ground.\n    *   This means the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) must be equal to or greater than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}}$).\n    *   So, we need to find the redshift `z` for which $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\approx \\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}}$.\n\n3.  **Establish the Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength:**\n    *   The practical lower limit for ground-based optical/UV astronomy is around 3500 Å (350 nm). While some photons at shorter wavelengths can get through, this is a standard value where atmospheric transmission becomes significant enough for detection.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   We use the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n        $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n    *   To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we must use the *minimum* observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff.\n        $z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n\n5.  **Use Python for a Precise Calculation:**\n\n```python\n# Define the rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Define the atmospheric cutoff wavelength in Angstroms.\n# A standard value for the start of the observable window from the ground is ~3500 Angstroms.\nlambda_obs_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift using the formula: z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum redshift is: {z_min}\")\n\n# Check the observed wavelength for the answer option z = 1.9\nz_option_B = 1.9\nlambda_obs_for_B = lambda_rest * (1 + z_option_B)\nprint(f\"For z = 1.9, the observed wavelength is: {lambda_obs_for_B} Angstroms\")\n```\n\n6.  **Interpret the Results:**\n    *   The calculation gives a minimum redshift of approximately 1.878.\n    *   Looking at the options provided:\n        A) 3\n        B) 1.9\n        C) 2.4\n        D) 1.2\n    *   The calculated value of 1.878 is extremely close to 1.9.\n    *   A redshift of 1.9 would shift the 1216 Å line to $1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4$ Å, which is right at the edge of the atmospheric window, making it the correct lower limit for detection.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum redshift (z) at which the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) spectral line can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the rest wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen has a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the observational constraint:** Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light at ultraviolet wavelengths. The atmosphere becomes significantly transparent to light only at wavelengths longer than about 3500 Å. This is known as the atmospheric cutoff. Therefore, to be detected from the ground, the Lyα line must be redshifted to an observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of at least 3500 Å.\n\n3.  **Apply the redshift formula:** The relationship between rest wavelength, observed wavelength, and redshift (z) is given by:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum redshift:** To find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the minimum required value, which is the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n    *   $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs} = 3500$ Å\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for z:\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n    $z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n    $z \\approx 2.878 - 1$\n    $z \\approx 1.878$\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88. Looking at the given options:\n    *   A) 3\n    *   B) 1.9\n    *   C) 2.4\n    *   D) 1.2\n\n    The value 1.9 is the closest to our calculated lower limit of 1.88. A redshift of 1.9 would shift the Lyα line to an observed wavelength of $1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4$ Å, which is just long enough to pass through the atmosphere and be detected.\n\n<<<B>>>"
