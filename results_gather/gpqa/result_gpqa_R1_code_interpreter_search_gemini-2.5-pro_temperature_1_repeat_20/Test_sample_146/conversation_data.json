    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a particle-antiparticle annihilation process. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its initial kinetic energy as zero.\n    *   A common setup for such problems is a fixed-target experiment where one particle is at rest. Let's assume the proton is at rest. Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy of the system is approximately zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\cdot m_p c^2$.\n    *   The total initial momentum is approximately zero, as both particles are essentially at rest.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Let $v$ be the velocity of each particle A. Due to the conservation of momentum (starting from zero), the particles must fly off in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. This implies that all four particles will have the same speed, $|v|$.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\cdot E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2 \\cdot m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   Now, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot m_p c^2}{4 \\cdot m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\cdot m_A c^2}$.\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        *   $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27}{2 \\cdot 300} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$.\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$.\n    *   So, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis can be efficiently calculated using a short script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# From conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for velocity v in terms of c from the Lorentz factor formula\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# => (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"{v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes the annihilation of a proton and a slowly moving antiproton, which means we can consider the initial system to be at rest. The total energy and momentum of the system are conserved during this process.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The system initially consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since they are at rest (or moving very slowly), their initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. The mass of a proton is the same as the mass of an antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_{p}c^{2} \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 \\cdot m_{p}c^{2} = 2 \\cdot (938 \\text{ MeV}) = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The system finally consists of four particles (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_{A}c^{2} = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. These particles will be moving, so their total energy includes both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^{2}$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\cdot E_{A} = 4 \\cdot (\\gamma m_{A}c^{2})$.\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 \\cdot m_{p}c^{2} = 4 \\cdot \\gamma m_{A}c^{2}$\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum is zero because the proton and antiproton are at rest.\n*   To conserve momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, this implies that all four particles must have the same speed, $v$.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe can now solve for the velocity $v$. First, let's find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, from the energy conservation equation:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot m_{p}c^{2}}{4 \\cdot m_{A}c^{2}} = \\frac{m_{p}c^{2}}{2 \\cdot m_{A}c^{2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\cdot 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNow, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$ in terms of the speed of light $c$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for $v/c$:\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} \\approx \\sqrt{0.591}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.769$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
