    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, and the parallax itself, `plx`.\n\n2.  **State the Assumption:** The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The number density is the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `4 * π * d²`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4 * π * d² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The fundamental relationship is `plx = 1/d` (assuming `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n    *   We need to express our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx` instead of `d`.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we can write `d = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Relate the Differentials (`dd` and `d(plx)`):**\n    *   We also need to relate the small thickness of the shell `dd` to a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship: `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the range, not the direction. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. So, we'll use the absolute value:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute Back into the Number of Stars Equation:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We can find this by dividing both sides of our last equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Determine the Proportionality:**\n    *   In the final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` (the constant star density) are all constants.\n    *   Therefore, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
