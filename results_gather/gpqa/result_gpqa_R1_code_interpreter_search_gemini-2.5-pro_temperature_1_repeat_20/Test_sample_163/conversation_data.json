    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as the factor `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Determine the Relevant Physical Law:** The total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of its components (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n    `M * sin^3(i) = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n    where `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Key Observational Details:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" For an eclipse to occur, the line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula to: `M ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Sum of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:** The term `(K1 + K2)` in the formula represents the sum of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars in a system.\n    *   For System 1: `K_sum1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For System 2: `K_sum2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n6.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M1 / M2`. We can write the mass equations for each system and then divide them.\n    *   `M1 ≈ (P1 * (K_sum1)^3) / (2 * π * G)`\n    *   `M2 ≈ (P2 * (K_sum2)^3) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n    The ratio is:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K_sum1)^3) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K_sum2)^3) / (2 * π * G) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.\n    `M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K_sum1)^3) / (P2 * (K_sum2)^3)`\n    This simplified formula allows us to use the given units directly (years for period and km/s for velocity) since it is a ratio.\n\n8.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_sum1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K_sum2 = 25 km/s\n\n    `M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n    `M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n\n    To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n    `6750 / 125 = 54`\n    `15625 / 125 = 125`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 1.2\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
