    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy with a specific atomic transition energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`<H>`)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect energy, describes the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is `H = -μ ⋅ B`. When the magnetic field `B` is directed along the z-axis, the energy shift is given by:\n\n`ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B`\n\nWhere:\n*   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant.\n*   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the external magnetic field.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   `B = 1 T`\n*   `m` is a small integer. We can assume a representative small, non-zero value, such as `m = 1`.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton in electron-volts per Tesla is approximately:\n`μ_B ≈ 5.788 × 10⁻⁵ eV/T`\n\nNow, we can calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:\n`<H> = 1 * (5.788 × 10⁻⁵ eV/T) * (1 T)`\n`<H> ≈ 5.788 × 10⁻⁵ eV`\n\nThis is the energy associated with the paramagnetic coupling for `m=1`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**\n\nThe transition energy `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength `λ`. The relationship between energy and wavelength is:\n\n`ΔE = hc / λ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is the Planck constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nA useful conversion factor is `hc ≈ 1240 eV⋅nm`.\n\nThe problem provides the wavelength:\n*   `λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm`\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy:\n`ΔE = (1240 eV⋅nm) / (486.1 nm)`\n`ΔE ≈ 2.551 eV`\n\nThis specific wavelength, `λ = 486.1 nm`, corresponds to the Balmer series transition in the Hydrogen atom from `n=4` to `n=2`.\n\n**3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: `<H> ≈ 5.788 × 10⁻⁵ eV`\n*   Transition energy: `ΔE ≈ 2.551 eV`\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n`ΔE / <H> ≈ 2.551 / (5.788 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 44075`\n\nThis shows that `ΔE` is more than 40,000 times larger than `<H>`. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\nIn mathematical terms, we can write:\n`\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E`\n\n<<<C>>>"
