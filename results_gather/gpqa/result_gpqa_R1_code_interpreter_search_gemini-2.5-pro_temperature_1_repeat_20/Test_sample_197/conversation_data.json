    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** In the solution, cobalt exists in several forms due to complexation with thiocyanate (SCN-). Let L represent the ligand SCN-. The species are:\n    *   Free cobalt(II) ion: Co^2+\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: [Co(L)]+\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: [Co(L)2]\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: [Co(L)3]-\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: [Co(L)4]2-\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(L)]+] + [[Co(L)2]] + [[Co(L)3]-] + [[Co(L)4]2-]\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co^2+]) and the free ligand ([L] = [SCN-]).\n    *   [[Co(L)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [L]\n    *   [[Co(L)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2\n    *   [[Co(L)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [L]^3\n    *   [[Co(L)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [L]^4\n\n5.  **Express Total Concentration in Terms of β:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][L] + β2[Co^2+][L]^2 + β3[Co^2+][L]^3 + β4[Co^2+][L]^4\n    By factoring out [Co^2+], we get:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\n6.  **Define the Mole Fraction (α):** The fraction of a specific complex, like [Co(L)2], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted by α. We are interested in α2 for the [Co(L)2] complex.\n    α2 = [[Co(L)2]] / c(Co)\n\n7.  **Derive the Formula for α2:** Substitute the expressions for [[Co(L)2]] and c(Co) into the equation for α2:\n    α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4))\n    The [Co^2+] term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration [L]:\n    α2 = (β2 * [L]^2) / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\n8.  **Plug in the Values:** Now, we can substitute the given values into this formula.\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n    *   [L] = [SCN-] = 0.1 M (We assume this is the free ligand concentration, a common convention in such problems, especially since the total metal concentration is much lower).\n\n9.  **Calculate:** We will use a Python script for an accurate calculation. The script will calculate the numerator (β2 * [L]^2) and the denominator (the sum of all terms) and then find the ratio.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Free ligand concentration [SCN-]\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the alpha fraction.\n# This is the sum of terms for all species, relative to the free metal ion.\n# Let's call the sum 'S'.\n# S = 1 (for Co^2+) + beta1*[L] + beta2*[L]^2 + beta3*[L]^3 + beta4*[L]^4\nS = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*(L**2) + beta3*(L**3) + beta4*(L**4)\n\n# The numerator for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] is the term beta2*[L]^2\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / S\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.9%\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction (α2) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
