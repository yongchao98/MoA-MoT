    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Let's identify the chiral center. The carbon at position 5 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen (-H), a methoxy group (-OCH3), a methyl group (-CH3), and a `CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3` group. This is a chiral center.\n    *   The problem states its configuration is (S).\n\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH4) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at position 3 to an alcohol.\n    *   The ketone's carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride attack can occur from two different faces, creating a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Since a new chiral center is formed at C3 (which can be R or S) and the existing center at C5 remains (S), two different products will be formed.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one identical chiral center (5S) and one opposite chiral center.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two stereoisomeric products (a pair of diastereomers) are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry. It is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (meso)-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **cannot** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the separable species in the mixture:\n1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**: This is one species.\n2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**: This is a diastereomer of species 1 and will have a different retention time.\n3.  **The enantiomeric pair {(2R, 4R) + (2S, 4S)}-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two enantiomers will co-elute and produce a single peak.\n4.  **(meso)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair (species 3) and will have a different retention time.\n\nFurthermore, the products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\nTherefore, we will observe **four** distinct peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It can separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**, because the chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer.\n\nLet's count the separable species in the mixture:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of 3, now separable)\n5.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, achiral diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n\nEach of the five stereoisomers is unique and will be resolved by an ideal chiral column. Therefore, we will observe **five** distinct peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
