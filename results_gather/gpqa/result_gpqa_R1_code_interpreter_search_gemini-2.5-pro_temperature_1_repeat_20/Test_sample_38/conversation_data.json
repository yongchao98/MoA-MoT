    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem asks for the value of a constant 'a' in a given wave function. In quantum mechanics, a fundamental principle for any valid wave function is that it must be normalized.\n\n2.  **Understand Normalization:** The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in all possible space must be equal to 1. The probability density of finding a particle at a position x is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². Therefore, the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1.\n    *   ∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n3.  **Define the limits of integration:** The problem specifies that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. This means the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero. So, we only need to integrate over this interval.\n    *   ∫ [from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability density |Ψ(x)|²:**\n    *   The wave function is given as Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n    *   This is a complex number of the form z = Re + i*Im, where:\n        *   The real part is Re(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n        *   The imaginary part is Im(x) = -0.5\n    *   The square of the magnitude of a complex number is calculated as |z|² = (Re)² + (Im)².\n    *   Therefore, |Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n    *   |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n5.  **Set up the normalization integral:** Now we substitute this expression for the probability density into our normalization equation:\n    *   ∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n6.  **Solve the integral:** We need to find the antiderivative of the expression inside the integral.\n    *   The integral of the first term is: ∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln|1 + x|\n    *   The integral of the second term is: ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n    *   So, the definite integral is [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] evaluated from x=1 to x=3.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the integral at the limits:**\n    *   Value at the upper limit (x=3): a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75\n    *   Value at the lower limit (x=1): a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25\n    *   The value of the definite integral is (Value at x=3) - (Value at x=1):\n        (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\n\n8.  **Solve for the constant 'a':**\n    *   a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\n    *   a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    *   Using the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\n        a² * ln(4/2) = 1 - 0.5\n        a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    *   a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    *   a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n9.  **Calculate the numerical value:** To find the final numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a^2\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate the value of a\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 0.8493.\n\n10. **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 0.85\n    *   B) 0.6\n    *   C) 0.35\n    *   D) 1.1\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.85 is a very close match to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
