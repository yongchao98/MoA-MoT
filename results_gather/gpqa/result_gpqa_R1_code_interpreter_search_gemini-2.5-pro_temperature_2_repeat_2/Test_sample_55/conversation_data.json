    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nThe question asks about a two-step electric dipole transition in a non-relativistic Hydrogen atom. The atom decays from the initial state `|3,0,0>` to the final state `|1,0,0>` through an intermediate state. We need to identify a valid transition route and the probability associated with that specific path. The notation used is `|n, l, m>`, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be `Δl = ±1`.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, `Δn`, can be any integer (`Δn = 0, ±1, ±2, ...`).\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the initial state `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩` to an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩`.\n*   **Initial State:** `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`  implies that the intermediate state must have `l' = 1`.\n    *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1` implies that the intermediate state can have `m' = -1, 0, or 1`.\n*   The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has `n' = 2`. This is an allowed change (`Δn = 2 - 3 = -1`).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the intermediate state `|int⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩` to the final state `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`.\n*   **Intermediate State:** `n'=2, l'=1, m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n*   **Final State:** `n''=1, l''=0, m''=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n    *   `Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'`. For `Δm` to be `0` or `±1`, we require `m'` to be `0` or `±1`.\n*   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final `|1,0,0⟩` state. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically allowed.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability of Each Route:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, the total process branches out at the first step. The probability of following a specific path is determined by the **branching ratio** of that first decay.\n\n*   The three possible first-step transitions are:\n    1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩`\n    2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩`\n    3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩`\n\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment `|<final|**d**|initial>|^2`. For spontaneous emission, we consider the rates for these three channels.\n\n*   A key physical insight is required here: The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Since the atom in its initial state has no preferred direction, and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (it occurs with equal probability in all directions), there can be no preference for which of the three `m'` sublevels of the `l'=1` state is populated.\n\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of decaying into each of the three `m'` states must be equal.\n    *   `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)`\n\n*   Since these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay (to the `n=2, l=1` manifold), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    *   `P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1`\n    *   `3 × P(any single m') = 1`\n    *   `P(any single m') = 1/3`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\nNow we compare this calculated probability with the values given in the options.\n\n*   A) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/4`. **Incorrect.**\n*   B) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `2/3`. **Incorrect.**\n*   C) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/4`. **Incorrect.**\n*   D) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/3`. **Correct.**\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
