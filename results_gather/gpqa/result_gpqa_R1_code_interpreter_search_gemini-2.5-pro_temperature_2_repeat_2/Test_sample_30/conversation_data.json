    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃), Nitric Acid (HNO₃), and Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene.\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing and activating group. The reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the benzene ring. While a mixture of ortho and para isomers is formed, the para isomer is typically the major product due to less steric hindrance. We will assume the reaction proceeds with the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    Structure of Product 1:\n    ```\n        CH₃\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n     /     \\\n    |       |\n     \\     /\n      \\\\   //\n        \\ /\n         |\n        NO₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** p-nitrotoluene (Product 1).\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a strong oxidation reaction. The reagents will oxidize the alkyl side chain of the aromatic ring.\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n    Structure of Product 2:\n    ```\n        COOH\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n     /     \\\n    |       |\n     \\     /\n      \\\\   //\n        \\ /\n         |\n        NO₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** p-nitrobenzoic acid (Product 2).\n*   **Reagents:** Acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  **Acid-Base Reaction:** The most acidic proton in p-nitrobenzoic acid is the one on the carboxyl group. NaOH, a strong base, will deprotonate it to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n        `4-NO₂-C₆H₄-COOH + NaOH → 4-NO₂-C₆H₄-COONa + H₂O`\n    2.  **Subsequent Reaction:** The combination of a nitroaromatic compound with acetone and a base can lead to several possibilities. The most common textbook reaction is the Janovsky reaction, which would form a Meisenheimer complex. However, this complex would be chiral and have C₁ symmetry, which is not among the options.\n\n        A less common but known reaction pathway involves the reduction of the nitro group by acetone in the presence of a strong base, followed by condensation.\n        *   **Reduction:** The nitro group (-NO₂) is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂). Acetone acts as the reducing agent and is oxidized.\n            Product of reduction: Sodium p-aminobenzoate.\n        *   **Condensation:** The newly formed primary amine (-NH₂) then reacts with the solvent, acetone, in a condensation reaction to form an imine (also known as a Schiff base).\n            `p-NH₂-C₆H₄-COO⁻ + (CH₃)₂CO → p-((CH₃)₂C=N)-C₆H₄-COO⁻ + H₂O`\n\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is sodium p-(N-isopropylideneamino)benzoate.\n\n    Structure of Product 3:\n    ```\n        COO⁻\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n     /     \\\n    |       |\n     \\     /\n      \\\\   //\n        \\ /\n         |\n        N=C(CH₃)₂\n    ```\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3:**\n\n*   To determine the molecular symmetry group (point group), we must analyze the symmetry elements of the structure of product 3: `p-((CH₃)₂C=N)-C₆H₄-COO⁻`.\n*   Let's consider the molecule's conformation. The benzene ring is planar. The carboxylate group (-COO⁻) and the atoms of the imine backbone (C-N=C) can also lie in this same plane to maximize conjugation.\n*   If we define this plane as the plane of symmetry (σ), we must check if the rest of the molecule is symmetric with respect to this plane.\n*   The `C=N-C₆H₄-COO` fragment lies entirely within this plane.\n*   The isopropylidene group `C(CH₃)₂` is attached to the nitrogen. The double-bonded carbon and the two methyl carbons form a trigonal planar geometry around the double-bonded carbon. The two methyl groups (-CH₃) are identical and will be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below the plane.\n*   Therefore, the entire molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry (the one containing the benzene ring and the C-N=C fragment).\n*   A molecule that has only one plane of symmetry (and the identity element E) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nLet's check other symmetry elements:\n*   **Rotation axis (Cn, n>1):** There is no rotational axis. For example, a C₂ axis passing through the para-substituents is not present because the -COO⁻ group is different from the -N=C(CH₃)₂ group.\n*   **Center of inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Improper rotation axis (Sn):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nSince the only symmetry element besides identity is a single mirror plane, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
