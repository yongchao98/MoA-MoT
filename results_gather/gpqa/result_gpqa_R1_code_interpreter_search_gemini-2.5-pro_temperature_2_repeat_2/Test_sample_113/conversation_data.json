    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   The first step is the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   In the second step, the negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Therefore, reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (an acid). The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Let's look at the options for A: H₃O⁺ and NaHSO₃.\n        *   H₃O⁺ (from a dilute acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is the correct choice to protonate the alkoxide.\n        *   NaHSO₃ is sodium bisulfite. It reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which are crystalline solids used for purification, but it does not lead to a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Thus, we can eliminate options C and D. The correct choice for 'A' is H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction of a nitrile.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base upon heating.\n    *   Let's look at the remaining options for B, which are CH₃COOH (from option A) and HCl (from option B).\n        *   CH₃COOH is acetic acid, a weak acid. It is generally not effective for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   HCl is hydrochloric acid, a strong acid. It is a standard reagent used for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. The reaction is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with aqueous HCl.\n    *   Therefore, the suitable reagent 'B' is HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
