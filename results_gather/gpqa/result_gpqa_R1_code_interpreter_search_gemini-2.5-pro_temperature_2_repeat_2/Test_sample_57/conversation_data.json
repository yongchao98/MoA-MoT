    "1.  **Analyze the User's Question:** The user wants to identify which of the four listed physical theories does not require a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle issues that arise at high energies (or, equivalently, short distances).\n\n2.  **Define Regularization:** In physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations for interactions often involve integrals over all possible energies and momenta of virtual particles in loops. These integrals frequently diverge, yielding infinite results for physically measurable quantities. This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence. Regularization is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities by introducing a new parameter, called a regulator or cutoff. This makes the integrals finite and workable. After regularization, a process called renormalization is used to absorb the regulator-dependent parts into the definitions of physical parameters (like mass and charge), resulting in finite, physically meaningful predictions.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the QFT of the strong nuclear force. Like other QFTs describing point particles, its loop calculations suffer from UV divergences. Therefore, QCD absolutely **requires regularization** (and subsequent renormalization) to produce finite results for scattering amplitudes and other observables.\n\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is governed by Maxwell's equations. It is a classical, not quantum, theory. As such, it does not involve the loop diagrams with virtual particles that cause the UV divergences characteristic of QFTs. However, it has its own, distinct infinity problem: the self-energy of a point charge. If you calculate the energy contained in the electric field of an electron modeled as a point with zero radius, the result is infinite. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at very short distances (high energies). This problem can be \"regularized\" in a classical sense by assuming the charge has a tiny, non-zero radius, effectively introducing a short-distance cutoff. Because it possesses a high-energy divergence that requires some form of ad-hoc modification (like assuming a finite size) to be resolved, it's not the best answer.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the QFT of the electromagnetic force. It was the first theory where regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to tame infinities in calculations (e.g., for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron). Like QCD, QED **requires regularization** to handle its UV divergences from loop diagrams.\n\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a quantum theory proposed as a candidate for a \"theory of everything,\" including quantum gravity. One of its primary theoretical selling points is that it is believed to be free from UV divergences. Unlike the point particles of QFT, strings are one-dimensional, extended objects. This \"smearing\" of the interaction point smooths out the behavior at very short distances. As a result, the loop amplitudes in superstring theory are conjectured to be intrinsically finite. The theory naturally regulates itself, so an external regularization procedure is not needed.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both QCD and QED are QFTs that famously require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics has its own self-energy divergence, which points to a high-energy breakdown. Superstring Theory, by its very construction, is believed to be finite at high energies and thus does not require regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
