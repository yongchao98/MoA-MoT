    "This question requires us to determine how many of the given compounds are chiral. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral compounds are optically active. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers, and the absence of elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. There are no chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents). The molecule is planar around the double bond. This plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This compound's IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers. The naming of a specific enantiomer implies that the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are the same as the substituents on C3. For such symmetrically substituted molecules, the stereoisomer with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. As a single, specific enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=`, and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)`. This compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, although non-standard, likely implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (the *all-cis* isomer). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the carbon at the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. The other possible stereoisomer (one -OH trans to the other two) is also achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which means a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1: `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)`. There is a methyl substituent at C3 and a cyclopentyl group at C1. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to check for chiral centers. Let's analyze C3. It is bonded to: (1) a hydrogen atom, (2) the terminal methyl group (C4), (3) the methyl substituent, and (4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Groups (2) and (3) are both methyl groups, so they are identical. Since C3 does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other potential chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (2), (4), (5)\n*   Optically Inactive: (1), (3), (6), (7)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
