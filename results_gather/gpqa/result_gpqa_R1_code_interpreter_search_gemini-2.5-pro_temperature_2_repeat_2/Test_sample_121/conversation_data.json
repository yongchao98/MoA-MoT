    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by alkylation, then a second deprotonation followed by intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic protons from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is still base present to remove the second, remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion is in the same molecule as a good leaving group (Br). Intramolecular SN2 reactions to form stable 5- or 6-membered rings are very fast. Here, the alpha-carbon attacks the terminal carbon of the 5-carbon chain, closing a 6-membered ring. This is a type of Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n2.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   Substituted cyclohexanes exist predominantly in chair conformations. Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the two possible chair conformations are diastereomers (not enantiomers).\n        *   **Conformer A:** Cyano group axial, ethoxycarbonyl group equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B:** Cyano group equatorial, ethoxycarbonyl group axial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is sterically bulkier than the cyano group. Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and the two conformers are not equally populated at equilibrium.\n    *   At room temperature, the interconversion (chair flip) between these two diastereomeric conformers is very rapid on the 1H NMR timescale. The observed spectrum is a weighted average of the spectra of the two individual conformers.\n3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:**\n    *   A simplified analysis might assume a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This would make C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent, leading to 3 ring signals plus 2 signals for the ethyl group, for a total of 5 signals.\n    *   However, this simplified analysis is incorrect for two reasons:\n        a.  The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) is itself not symmetric. The environment on the side of the C=O is different from the side of the -OCH2CH3. This asymmetry means there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C4 axis, and thus C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        b.  Even if the substituents were symmetric, because the two chair conformers are diastereomers and are unequally populated, the time-averaging process does not restore symmetry perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the five methylene (CH₂) groups in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n4.  **Diastereotopic Protons:**\n    *   For any given methylene group (e.g., at C2) in the ring, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given instant) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule, even when considering its conformational flexibility, lacks the necessary symmetry elements to make them equivalent.\n    *   When the rapid, unequal chair-flipping occurs, the averaged environment of the \"axial-type\" proton is different from the averaged environment of the \"equatorial-type\" proton. They do not become equivalent.\n    *   Thus, for each of the 5 distinct methylene carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), its two protons are also chemically distinct.\n5.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl group:** The -OCH₂CH₃ group has two distinct sets of protons: the methylene protons (-CH₂-) and the methyl protons (-CH₃). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:** There are 5 methylene groups (C2 to C6). Since each carbon's environment is unique, and the two protons on each carbon are also unique (diastereotopic), we have 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring.\n    *   **Total Signals:** 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring protons) = 12 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
