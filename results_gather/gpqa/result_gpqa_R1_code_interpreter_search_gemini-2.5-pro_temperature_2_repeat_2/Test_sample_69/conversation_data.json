    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: Hydrolysis of C.**\n    *   `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n    *   The hydrolysis of a single substance (C) produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). This is a very strong hint about the composition of C. It must contain elements that can form such acids.\n    *   A common example is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride. For instance, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) hydrolyzes in water. The reaction is complex but can be summarized as: `2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → SO₂ + 4 HCl + S`.\n    *   Let's check if this fits the clue:\n        *   The products are elemental sulfur (S), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n        *   Elemental sulfur (A) is a solid, which matches the description of A. The clue says \"reforms A\", which fits perfectly.\n        *   HCl (F) is a strong acid.\n        *   SO₂ dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid, H₂SO₃ (G), which is a weak acid.\n    *   This perfectly matches the clue. So, let's hypothesize:\n        *   **A = S** (in its stable form, S₈)\n        *   **C = SCl₂**\n        *   **F = HCl**\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃**\n\n2.  **Verify Clue 1 with our hypothesis.**\n    *   `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   If A = S₈ (solid) and C = SCl₂, then B must be the chlorinating agent, Chlorine gas (Cl₂).\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry. The reaction to form sulfur dichloride from sulfur and chlorine is: `S₈ + 8 Cl₂ → 8 SCl₂`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles (equivalents) of B (Cl₂) to produce the product C (SCl₂). This matches the clue \"8 equivalents of gas B\" perfectly.\n    *   Now, what about the color? C = SCl₂ is described as a cherry-red liquid. \"Bright red\" is a reasonable description for a puzzle.\n    *   So, our hypothesis is strengthened:\n        *   **B = Cl₂**\n\n3.  **Verify Clue 4 with our hypothesis.**\n    *   `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   We have B = Cl₂. The clue becomes: `D + Cl₂ → H` (1:1 ratio, H is a solvent).\n    *   A very common 1:1 reaction of chlorine gas with a gaseous substance D to produce a solvent is the addition of chlorine to an alkene. The simplest alkene is ethylene (C₂H₄).\n    *   Reaction: `C₂H₄ + Cl₂ → C₂H₄Cl₂` (1,2-dichloroethane).\n    *   Is D = C₂H₄ a gas? Yes.\n    *   Is H = 1,2-dichloroethane a solvent? Yes, it's a widely used organic solvent.\n    *   Is the reaction ratio 1:1? Yes.\n    *   This also fits perfectly. So we can identify:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (ethylene)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n4.  **Verify Clue 2 and Identify E.**\n    *   `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   Using our identified substances: C = SCl₂, D = C₂H₄.\n    *   Reaction: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is a known reaction, the Levinstein process for the synthesis of mustard gas: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   So, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, which is mustard gas.\n    *   Is mustard gas \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes, it is a potent chemical warfare agent. This fits the final clue.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E.**\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E, which we have identified as mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two ethyl chloride groups. Due to free rotation around the S-C and C-C bonds, the molecule can exist in several conformations (conformers).\n    *   We need to find the point group of its most stable or representative conformation. The molecule is not planar or linear.\n    *   Let's analyze its symmetry elements. Imagine the S atom at the origin. There is a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis can superimpose the two `(-CH₂CH₂Cl)` groups onto each other in certain conformations (specifically, the lowest-energy gauche,gauche conformer).\n    *   There are no mirror planes (σ), no center of inversion (i), and no improper rotation axes (Sₙ).\n    *   A molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of mustard gas is C₂.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options.**\n    *   A) D∞h\n    *   B) C2v\n    *   C) C2\n    *   D) D4h\n    *   Our determined point group, C₂, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
