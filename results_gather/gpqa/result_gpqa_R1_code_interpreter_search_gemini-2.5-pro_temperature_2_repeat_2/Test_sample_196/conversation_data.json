    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid (often around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n        *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal is very downfield and broad. It corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them. The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   Now let's analyze the signals for the other substituent, which is an alkyl group.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both the methyl group (from 0.9 ppm) and another group, likely a methine (-CH-). This forms an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H suggests another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H is the methine proton (-CH-). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm (making it a doublet), the methylene group at 1.7 ppm, and it is also attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic position), which explains its downfield shift.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a central CH group. It is attached to one -CH₃ group (from 1.4 ppm) and one -CH₂CH₃ group (from 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This structure is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a sec-butyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The alkyl group is sec-butyl. The full structure of Compound X is a benzene ring substituted with a -COOH group and a sec-butyl group at para positions. This is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D, but D is the reactant, not the product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (P/HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to the corresponding alkane. Specifically, the -COOH group is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Product Formation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Reaction: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected.\n        *   Final Product: The product will have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group at the para positions on the benzene ring. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is not reduced.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches our predicted final product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl chain is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
