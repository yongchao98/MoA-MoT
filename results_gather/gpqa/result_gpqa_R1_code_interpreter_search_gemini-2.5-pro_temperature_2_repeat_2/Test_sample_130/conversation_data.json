    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene dehydrated to an anhydride:** The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: 137, 165 ppm) points to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons (~7.0 ppm), two equivalent alkene carbons (~135 ppm), and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm), matching the data perfectly.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4, and a CH₂ group at C5. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products:**\n    *   A Diels-Alder reaction creates a new six-membered ring. In this case, it forms a bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the adduct: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the question.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry that bisects the anhydride ring, the newly formed C=C bond, and the C7-methylene bridge.\n    *   This symmetry results in four main sets of proton signals:\n        1.  **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond (at C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n        2.  **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        3.  **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** The two protons on the carbons fused to the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be higher, around 3.0-4.0 ppm, due to being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        4.  **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, the other is *anti*). They are not equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, each with an integral of 1H, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets or part of a more complex multiplet. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1.0-2.0 ppm range.\n\n4.  **Use the NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **In the endo isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond, on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) very close to:\n        *   The vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n        *   The *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (H_bridge_syn).\n    *   **In the exo isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C bond and the C7-bridge. The distances between H_anhydride and both Me_vinyl and H_bridge are much larger.\n    *   Therefore, an NOE cross-peak between H_anhydride and either Me_vinyl or H_bridge_syn will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent/weak in the minor (exo) product.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's assign the signals from the options to the protons we identified:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> **Me_vinyl**\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm -> **Me_bridgehead**\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> **H_anhydride**\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> **H_bridge** (likely the *syn* proton)\n    *   Now let's check which option describes an interaction specific to the endo isomer:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This NOE is strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo isomer. This is a very strong candidate.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge).** This interaction is present in both isomers. It is not a differentiating peak.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl).** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is determined by the rigid bicyclic framework and would be similar in both isomers.\n        *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the proximity between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This NOE is also strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo.\n\n6.  **Choose the Best Answer:**\n    *   Both options A and D describe valid NOE correlations that are unique to the major (endo) product.\n    *   However, the interaction in option A is between a group of 6 protons (Me_vinyl) and a group of 2 protons (H_anhydride). The interaction in option D is between 1 proton (H_bridge) and 2 protons (H_anhydride).\n    *   The intensity of an NOE cross-peak is proportional to the number of interacting protons. The interaction described in A (involving 6 protons and 2 protons) will give rise to a significantly more intense cross-peak than the one in D (involving 1 proton and 2 protons), assuming similar distances.\n    *   The question refers to \"*a* cross-peak\" that differentiates the isomers, suggesting the most prominent and characteristic one. The NOE between the anhydride protons and the protons on the vinylic system (in this case, the methyl groups) is the classic textbook example used to identify the endo adduct in these reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and prominent differentiating cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
