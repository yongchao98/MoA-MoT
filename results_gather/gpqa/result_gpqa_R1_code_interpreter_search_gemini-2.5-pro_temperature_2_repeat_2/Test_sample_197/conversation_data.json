    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution with a given concentration of thiocyanate ligand. We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co^2+) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2-. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co^2+ ion and all these complexes.\n\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co^2+], the free ligand concentration [SCN-], and the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n*   [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n*   [[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n*   [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n**3. Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (Mole Fraction)**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, such as [Co(SCN)2], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted as α2.\n\nα2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2:\nα2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)\n\nThe [Co^2+] term appears in both the numerator and every term of the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\nα2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M. This information is not needed for calculating the species distribution, which depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN-], as long as we assume [SCN-] represents the equilibrium concentration. Given the options, this is the intended method.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n*   β1 = 9\n*   β2 = 40\n*   β3 = 63\n*   β4 = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the formula. Let L = [SCN-] = 0.1 M.\n\n*   Numerator term (for [Co(SCN)2]):\n    β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   Term for Co^2+: 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]+: β1 * L^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)2]: β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)3]-: β3 * L^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)4]^2-: β4 * L^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n*   Sum of denominator terms:\n    Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   Calculate the fraction α2:\n    α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   Convert to percentage:\n    Percentage = α2 * 100 ≈ 16.916 %\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo confirm our approach, we can use a Python script for precise calculation.\n```python\n# Define the stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Define the free ligand concentration\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the term for the target complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4\n# The term for n=0 (free Co2+) is beta0 * L^0 = 1 * 1 = 1\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L**1) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) is: {percentage}%\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user has provided a question about coordination chemistry, specifically the distribution of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes in solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the \"dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex\" among all cobalt-containing species. This corresponds to the complex `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n\n**2. Define the System:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n*   Thiocyanate (ligand) concentration, [SCN-] = 0.1 M. We can assume this is the equilibrium concentration since we are not given enough information to calculate its change upon complexation (it is likely in large excess).\n*   Overall stability constants (βn) are given:\n    *   Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+ ; β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]) = 9\n    *   Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2] ; β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) = 40\n    *   Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]- ; β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) = 63\n    *   Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2- ; β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4) = 16\n\n**3. Formulate the Mole Fraction (Percentage) Calculation:**\nThe percentage of a specific species (like `[Co(SCN)2]`) is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, multiplied by 100. Let's denote the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` as `α₂`.\n\nPercentage = α₂ * 100 = ( [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co) ) * 100\n\nLet's express each species concentration in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the ligand concentration `[L]` (where L = SCN-), and the stability constants `βn`.\n\n*   [[Co(SCN)]+] = β₁ * [Co^2+] * [L]¹\n*   [[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co^2+] * [L]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β₃ * [Co^2+] * [L]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β₄ * [Co^2+] * [L]⁴\n\nNow substitute these into the total concentration expression:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][L]¹ + β₂[Co^2+][L]² + β₃[Co^2+][L]³ + β₄[Co^2+][L]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n\nNow we can write the expression for α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [L]²) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴))\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [L]²) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n\nThis shows that the distribution of species depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\nGiven values:\n*   [L] = [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n*   **Numerator:**\n    Term for `[Co(SCN)2]`: β₂ * [L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   **Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all species.\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): β₁ * [L]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)2]` (n=2): β₂ * [L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)3]⁻` (n=3): β₃ * [L]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻` (n=4): β₄ * [L]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum (Denominator):** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction α₂:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Calculate the percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916 %\n\nThis result matches the one from the code execution.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
