    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:**\n    The products of both reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   \"pyran\": A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   \"tetrahydro\": The ring is saturated.\n    *   \"2-one\": A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (position 1). This structure is a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a 6-membered ring).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\": An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring. This is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-isomer. Reaction 2 produces the (S)-isomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Materials:**\n    The options provided are all stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine the structure from this name.\n    *   \"pentanoic acid\": This indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) as the principal functional group, which defines carbon C1.\n    *   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is on C3.\n    *   \"5-oxo\" and \"5-isobutoxy\": These groups at C5 describe an ester group: -C(=O)O-isobutyl.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n    *   This molecule has two different carboxyl-derived functional groups: a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5). The chiral center is at C3. A more systematic name is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid 5-isobutyl ester or 4-(isobutoxycarbonyl)-3-ethylbutanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Step-by-step reaction**:\n        a. Starting material A must be the (R) or (S) isomer of `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`.\n        b. LiBH₄ reduces the ester at C5: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`. The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        c. The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid on C1 to form the 6-membered delta-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact.\n    *   **Step-by-step reaction**:\n        a. Starting material B is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`.\n        b. BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1: `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n        c. The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group on C1 attacks the ester carbonyl carbon C5, and isobutanol is eliminated.\n        d. The atoms forming the ring are: the oxygen from the C1-alcohol, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 (the carbonyl carbon). This forms a 6-membered ring, which is the required delta-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: These reactions also do not involve the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Match**:\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
