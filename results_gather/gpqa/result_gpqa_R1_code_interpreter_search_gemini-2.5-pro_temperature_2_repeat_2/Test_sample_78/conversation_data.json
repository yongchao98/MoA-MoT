    "*   **Analysis of the Reaction and Product**\n    1.  **Reaction:** The starting material, Compound X (C11H12O), is treated with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) at a high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base, and the high temperature suggests a thermal rearrangement or isomerization reaction. The product will have the same chemical formula as the reactant (C11H12O).\n    2.  **Product 1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   `δ 7.71 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.08 (2H, d)`: This pattern is characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The two sets of protons are ortho to different substituents.\n        *   `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`: A singlet methyl group. Given the presence of a para-disubstituted ring, this is very likely a methyl group attached to the ring, forming a *p-tolyl* group.\n        *   `δ 2.28 (3H, s)`: A second singlet methyl group. Since it's a singlet, it's not coupled to any protons, suggesting it's attached to a quaternary carbon or a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n        *   `δ 7.68 (1H, d)` and `δ 6.75 (1H, d)`: These are two vinylic protons (on a C=C double bond) that are coupled to each other. The large difference in their chemical shifts suggests they are in a conjugated system, likely trans to each other.\n    3.  **Product 13C-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   `δ 197.7 (1C, s)`: This is a typical chemical shift for a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   `δ 21.3 (1C, s)` and `δ 28.4 (1C, s)`: These are the two methyl carbons. δ 21.3 is typical for an aromatic methyl group (on the tolyl group), and δ 28.4 is consistent with a methyl group next to a carbonyl (acetyl group).\n        *   `δ 126.9 (2C, s)` and `δ 129.1 (2C, s)`: These represent the four CH carbons of the para-disubstituted benzene ring. The notation (2C) indicates two carbons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   `δ 127.1 (1C, s)` and `δ 130.3 (1C, s)`: These are the two CH carbons of the C=C double bond.\n        *   `δ 141.5 (1C, s)` and `δ 144.1 (1C, s)`: These are the two quaternary carbons of the benzene ring (the ones bearing the substituents).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The pieces are: a *p-tolyl* group, a carbonyl group, a *trans*-CH=CH- group, and a methyl group. The most logical way to connect these fragments to match the NMR data is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n    Structure: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3`\n    *   This structure contains a p-tolyl group (`p-CH3-C6H4-`), which explains the p-disubstituted aromatic signals and one methyl singlet (`δ 2.31`).\n    *   It contains an acetyl group (`-CO-CH3`), which explains the ketone signal in 13C NMR and the second methyl singlet (`δ 2.28`).\n    *   It contains a trans `CH=CH` group, explaining the two vinylic doublets.\n    *   The formula is C11H12O. This structure is a perfect match for the provided 1H NMR data and is consistent with most of the 13C NMR data.\n\n*   **Identifying Compound X from the Options**\n    The reaction is an isomerization, so the starting material (Compound X) must contain the same atoms as the product. The most characteristic structural feature of the product is the *p-tolyl* group. This group must also be present in the reactant. Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) 2-styrylepoxide (2-phenylethenyl-oxirane): Contains a *phenyl* group (C6H5-), not a *p-tolyl* group. Incorrect formula (C10H10O).\n    *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a *styryl* group, which has a *phenyl* substituent, not a *p-tolyl* one.\n    *   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: Contains a *4-methylstyryl* group (`p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-`). This is a *p-tolyl* group attached to a vinyl group. This is the only option containing the required *p-tolyl* skeleton.\n    *   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a *phenyl* group, not a *p-tolyl* group.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Since the product clearly contains a *p-tolyl* group, the starting material must also contain one. Only option C, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, has this structural feature. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to a more stable conjugated ketone, which is a known and plausible transformation.\n\n    Reactant (X): `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH-O-CH2` (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)\n    Product: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3` ((E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one)\n\nThus, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
