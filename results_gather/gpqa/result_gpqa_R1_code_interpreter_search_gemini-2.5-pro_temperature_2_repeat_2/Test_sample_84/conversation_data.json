    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2. The ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy balance between the radiation it receives from its host star and the energy it radiates away. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet and divide them:\n\nT_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\nT_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). This allows us to cancel these terms:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by the planets. This shift is related to the star's orbital velocity amplitude (K) induced by the planet's gravity.\n\nThe relationship between the velocity amplitude K, the planet's mass M_p, the star's mass M_star, and the semi-major axis 'a' for a circular orbit is given by:\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n(This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, M_p << M_star, and the orbital inclination is i=90°, which is a valid assumption since the planets were detected by the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1 using the formula we just derived:\na_1 = (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)\na_2 = (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)\n\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Formula**\nNow, substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\n**7. Calculate the Ratios from Given Data**\nWe need to calculate the mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1) and the velocity amplitude ratio (K1 / K2).\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K):**\n    The Doppler shift formula is Δλ / λ_0 = v / c, so the velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift Δλ (since c and λ_0 are constants).\n    K ∝ Δλ\n    Therefore, the ratio of velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**8. Final Calculation**\nNow, plug these ratios into the equation from step 6:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n```python\n# This code calculates the final numerical value for the ratio.\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n> 0.5357142857142857\n\nThe result is approximately 0.536. This corresponds to option A. Note that much of the provided information (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) was not needed for the final calculation as it canceled out in the ratios.\n\n<<<A>>>",
