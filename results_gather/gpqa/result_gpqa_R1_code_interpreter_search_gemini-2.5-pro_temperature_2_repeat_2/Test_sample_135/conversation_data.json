    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points in the radial direction from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇.f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this kind of problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the closed surface that bounds the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    *Note on the singularity:* The field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), where the divergence theorem doesn't strictly apply. However, this is a classic scenario (analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge in electromagnetism) where applying the theorem to the outer boundary gives the correct result for the source contained within. The value of the integral is determined entirely by the singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    We will calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n    *   **The Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the vector field is:\n        `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n    *   **The Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal to a sphere is the radial direction `r̂`. So, the vector surface element is:\n        `dS = dS * r̂`\n        where `dS` is the magnitude of the differential area.\n    *   **The Dot Product (f . dS):** Now we compute the dot product inside the integral:\n        `f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r̂) . (dS * r̂)`\n        Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now substitute this back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is also a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n    The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere `S`. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n    So, the value of the integral is:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n    Therefore, the most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated answer matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
