    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium.**\n    The problem involves the Ca-EDTA complex in solution. This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (represented as Y⁴⁻, assuming an ideal pH where it is fully deprotonated).\n\n    The formation reaction is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation is given as K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n\n    To find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let C be the initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. We assume initially there are no free Ca²⁺ or Y⁴⁻ ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n    | Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | [CaY]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | Ca²⁺        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | Y⁴⁻         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n3.  **Write the equilibrium constant expression.**\n    The formation constant (K_f) is expressed as:\n    K_f = [Products] / [Reactants] = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n4.  **Solve for 'x'.**\n    Because the formation constant K_f is very large (5.0 x 10¹⁰ >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction, meaning the dissociation is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n\n    We can make a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\n\n    Now we perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\nC = 0.02 # M\n\n# Formation constant (Kf) for Ca-EDTA\nKf = 5.0e10\n\n# From the simplified equilibrium expression: Kf = C / x^2\n# Solve for x^2: x^2 = C / Kf\nx_squared = C / Kf\n\n# Solve for x, which is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution successful:\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation gives x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n5.  **Verify the assumption.**\n    Our calculated value for x is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷. Comparing this to the initial concentration of 0.02 M:\n    (6.32 x 10⁻⁷) / 0.02 * 100% ≈ 0.003%\n    Since this is much less than 5%, our assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 is valid.\n\n6.  **Final Answer.**\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to 'x'.\n    [Ca²⁺] = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻) is:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for the complex is given:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are given an initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex of 0.02 M. Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [CaY]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nSince the formation constant K_f is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, meaning very little will dissociate. Therefore, we can assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 M (x << 0.02), which allows us to simplify the equation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe expression becomes:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions [Ca²⁺] is equal to x.\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
