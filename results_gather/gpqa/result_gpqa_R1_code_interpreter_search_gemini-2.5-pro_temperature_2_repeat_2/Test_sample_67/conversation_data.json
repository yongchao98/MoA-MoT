    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment operator is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B **k̂** (along the +Z axis).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γB S_z.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin up, |+z⟩) and -ħ/2 (spin down, |-z⟩).\n    *   The energy levels are E = -γB(±ħ/2).\n    *   To find the lowest energy state, we need to know the sign of γ. However, we can also consider the alignment of the magnetic moment's *expectation value* `<**μ**>` with the field **B**.\n    *   For the spin-up state |+z⟩, we have ⟨**S**⟩ = (0, 0, +ħ/2) and ⟨**μ**⟩ = γ(0, 0, +ħ/2). For this to be aligned with **B** = B **k̂**, γ must be positive.\n    *   For the spin-down state |-z⟩, we have ⟨**S**⟩ = (0, 0, -ħ/2) and ⟨**μ**⟩ = γ(0, 0, -ħ/2). For this to be aligned with **B** = B **k̂**, γ must be negative.\n    *   In both cases, the magnetic moment points in the +Z direction. Let's assume the most straightforward case where γ > 0, so the initial state is the spin-up state along Z.\n    *   Initial state at t=0: |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. In the S_z basis, this is represented by the vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian for t > 0\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B **ĵ** (along the +Y axis).\n*   The new Hamiltonian for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB S_y.\n*   The S_y operator in the S_z basis is given by the Pauli matrix σ_y, scaled by ħ/2:\n    S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n*   So, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n*   The Hamiltonian is H' = -ωS_y.\n*   U(t) = exp(-i(-ωS_y)t/ħ) = exp(iωt S_y/ħ).\n*   Since S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, the exponent is (iωt/ħ) * (ħ/2)σ_y = i(ωt/2)σ_y.\n*   So, U(t) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y).\n*   For any Pauli matrix σ, exp(iθσ) = Icos(θ) + iσsin(θ), where I is the identity matrix.\n*   U(t) = I*cos(ωt/2) + iσ_y*sin(ωt/2)\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i*sin(ωt/2)*[[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]\n*   Now, we find the state at time t:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n*   In terms of the basis states, |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|-z⟩.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\n\n*   We need to find the expectation value of μ_z, which is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩.\n*   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n*   The S_z operator in its own basis is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n*   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n*   Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * ωt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt).\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt).\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The expression for ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ is an oscillation described by the function cos(ωt).\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is ω.\n*   We defined ω = γB.\n*   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process provided a complete analytical solution.\n# The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment\n# oscillates as cos(ωt), where the angular frequency ω is given by γB.\n# Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.\n# No code is needed to solve this problem, the derivation is purely analytical.\n# The final answer is based on the derived frequency ω = γB.\n# This corresponds to option C.\n\nprint(\"The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\")\nprint(\"The derivation proceeds as follows:\")\nprint(\"1.

    "An analytical step-by-step derivation is provided to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, **μ** = γ**S**, is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, **B** = B **k̂**. The Hamiltonian for this situation is H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S_z. Alignment with the field means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n    *   The operator S_z has two eigenstates: spin-up |+z⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down |-z⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio γ is positive (as is common for the intrinsic spin of particles like the electron, though γ_e is negative, the \"γ\" in these problems is often treated as a positive constant), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_up.\n    *   Thus, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis: |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):**\n    Suddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B **ĵ**. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t>0 is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB S_y.\n    *   In the S_z basis, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ħ/2):\n        S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   So, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -γB(ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   U(t) = exp[-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ] = exp[iγBt S_y/ħ]\n    *   Substituting S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, we get: U(t) = exp[iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y].\n    *   Using the mathematical identity for Pauli matrices, exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix and θ = γBt/2.\n    *   U(t) = I*cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y*sin(γBt/2) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` * `[1, 0]ᵀ` = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   In bracket notation, the state at time t is: |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨γS_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   The operator S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt).\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt) describes a sinusoidal oscillation.
