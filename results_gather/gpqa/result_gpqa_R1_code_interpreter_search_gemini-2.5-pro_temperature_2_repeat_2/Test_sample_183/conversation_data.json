    "This question asks for a sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first establish the structure of the target molecule based on IUPAC nomenclature.\nThe parent name is benzene. The substituents are:\n-   At C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n-   At C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n-   At C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe substituents are arranged on three adjacent carbons (a vicinal or 1,2,3-substitution pattern). The relationships are:\n-   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n-   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n-   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes via classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can be challenging due to the directing effects of substituents, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step be regioselective and efficient.\n\nLet's analyze the given options one by one.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, and the minor product is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). Let's assume we proceed with the minor ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct substitution to position 4. So, the product would be 4-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate from step (iii) does not contain an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible as written.\n**Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs para, so the product is 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This is a common strategy to block the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct the incoming electrophile to the position ortho to the -tBu group (position 2). Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step suggests nitrating the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and used immediately. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard, safe, or productive reaction.\n**Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: -> Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, the major product is m-tert-butylaniline. This is not a \"high-yield\" reaction for other isomers and the reaction is often complex.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. This reaction will produce a mixture of isomers because the directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-directing) and -tBu (ortho,para-directing) groups are not fully cooperative. It is very unlikely to produce a single isomer in high yield, let alone the specific one needed for the final 1,2,3 product.\n**Conclusion: Option C does not represent a high-yield synthesis.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions in option D.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As stated before, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, formed in high yield due to steric preference for the para position. This is a good start for a high-yield synthesis.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to give **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard high-yield reaction.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amine and control regioselectivity, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., via acetylation to form -NHCOCH3), though this step is often omitted in shorthand problems. The protected -NHAc group is a strong o,p-director, as is the -tBu group. Both direct to the position ortho to the acetylamino group (position 2). So, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** is formed (after deprotection). This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form the diazonium salt, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether. This gives **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nThis sequence of reactions is chemically sound and each step is known to be high-yield. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, NOT the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\nOptions A and B contain chemically invalid steps. Option C involves reactions that are not high-yield and do not selectively lead to the desired precursor. Option D describes a logical and high-yield synthesis of a closely related isomer (1,2,4- pattern). Steps (viii) and (ix) in option D seem superfluous, but the core synthesis path (i-vii) is robust.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question and options A, B, and C are critically flawed for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, it is overwhelmingly likely that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question. If the target compound was intended to be the 1,2,4-isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), then sequence D would be the correct answer. This is the most common scenario for such problems in an educational context.\n\n<<<D>>>"
