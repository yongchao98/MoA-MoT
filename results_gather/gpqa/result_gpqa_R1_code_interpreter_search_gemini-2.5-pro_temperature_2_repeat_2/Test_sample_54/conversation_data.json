    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integration (Number of Protons):**\nFirst, let's sum the number of protons represented by each signal:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n\nNow let's check the proton counts for the possible options:\n*   **Propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., Crotyl acetate, CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-CO-CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match. Other butenyl acetate isomers also have more than 8 protons.\n\nBased on the total number of protons, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:**\n\nLet's break down each signal from the provided data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a characteristic shift for the protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). This fits the \"acetate\" part of the name.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule). This implies a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond). This signal corresponds to the CH₃ group on the propenyl part of the molecule.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** These are two single protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5-7 ppm):** These shifts are in the vinylic region, meaning these protons are attached directly to the carbons of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly downfield (deshielded) because it is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the acetate group (-O-CH=). It's a doublet because it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to two different sets of protons, hence the \"dq\" (doublet of quartets) multiplicity. The \"doublet\" part comes from splitting by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the \"quartet\" part comes from splitting by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the Cis and Trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is dependent on the angle between them:\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for trans-vinylic protons. This indicates that the molecule has a trans configuration at the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum points to a structure with 8 protons, containing an acetyl group and a trans-propenyl group. This corresponds to **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
