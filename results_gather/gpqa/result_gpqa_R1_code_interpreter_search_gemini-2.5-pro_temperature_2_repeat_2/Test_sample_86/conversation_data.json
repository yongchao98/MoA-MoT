    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (formula C₆H₄XY).\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's designate this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbon atoms and contain the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common group that fits this description (2 carbons, one carbonyl) is the acetyl group, -COCH₃.\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits all the given criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the possible isomers and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of each isomer, as this greatly influences the 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers**: These are asymmetrical. They would have four distinct signals for the four protons on the aromatic ring, likely resulting in a complex multiplet pattern.\n        *   **Para isomer**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Predicted spectrum for the para isomer (p-haloacetophenone):**\n        *   **Aromatic Region (6.5-8.5 ppm):** We expect two distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the acetyl group.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the halogen.\n            *   Each signal will be a doublet because its protons are coupled to the other set of protons (ortho-coupling).\n            *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n            *   The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n            *   This will produce a singlet, integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃) is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. The rest of the signals do not fit a simple, logical structure consistent with the prompt.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Again, the signals at `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only 1H NMR data that is consistent with the deduced structure of p-haloacetophenone is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
