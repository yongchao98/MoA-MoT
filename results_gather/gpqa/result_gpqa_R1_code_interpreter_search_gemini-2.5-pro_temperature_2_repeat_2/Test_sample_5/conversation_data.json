    "*   **1. Understanding the Potential**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often helpful to switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y), as this can sometimes reveal a separation of variables. The conversion formulas are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n*   **2. Converting to Cartesian Coordinates**\n    Substitute the Cartesian relations into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\n    Since x = r cos(θ), the second term becomes 3/2 kx^2.\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n    Now, group the terms with x and y:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n*   **3. Recognizing Separable Harmonic Oscillators**\n    The potential is now in the form V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n    This shows that the system is equivalent to two independent (uncoupled) quantum harmonic oscillators, one oscillating in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies of the two oscillators, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n*   **4. Finding the Frequencies of the Oscillators**\n    The standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2, and its energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. We need to find the effective angular frequencies ω_x and ω_y for our system.\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        Compare V_x(x) = 2kx^2 with 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n        1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        Compare V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2 with 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n        1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **5. Calculating the Total Energy Spectrum**\n    Now we can write the energy eigenvalues for each oscillator using their respective quantum numbers, n_x and n_y (where n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   Energy for the x-oscillator:\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    *   Energy for the y-oscillator:\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The total energy E is the sum E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **6. Comparing with the Options**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
