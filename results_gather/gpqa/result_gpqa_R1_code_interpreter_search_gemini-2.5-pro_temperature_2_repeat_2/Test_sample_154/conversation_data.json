    "The user wants me to find the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$ for a given quantum state.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **State Vector ($\\psi$)**: The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    $\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   **Operator ($P_z$)**: The operator for the z-component of $\\vec{P}$ is given by the matrix:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   **Uncertainty ($\\Delta P_z$)**: The uncertainty in a measurement of an operator A is defined as $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$, where $\\langle O \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $O$.\n*   **Expectation Value ($\\langle O \\rangle$)**: For an operator $O$ and a state $\\psi$, the expectation value is calculated as $\\langle O \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger O \\psi$, where $\\psi^\\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $\\psi$.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**Step 2a: Check for Normalization**\nFirst, let's verify that the given state vector is normalized, i.e., $\\psi^\\dagger \\psi = 1$.\nThe conjugate transpose of $\\psi$ is $\\psi^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\psi^\\dagger \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\nThe state is indeed normalized.\n\n**Step 2b: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi$\n\nFirst, compute $P_z \\psi$:\n$P_z \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply by $\\psi^\\dagger$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$.\n\nSo, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**Step 2c: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi$\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, compute $P_z^2 \\psi$:\n$P_z^2 \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply by $\\psi^\\dagger$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\nSo, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**Step 2d: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Alternative Method**\n\nThe basis vectors are eigenvectors of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$.\nThe state vector $\\psi$ can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n$\\psi = c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_3 \\end{pmatrix}$\nFrom the given state vector, we have $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$.\nThe probability of measuring each eigenvalue is $p_i = |c_i|^2$.\n$p_1 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n$p_2 = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n$p_3 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n(Note: $p_1+p_2+p_3 = 1/4+1/2+1/4 = 1$)\n\nThe expectation value is the weighted average of the eigenvalues:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = p_1 \\lambda_1 + p_2 \\lambda_2 + p_3 \\lambda_3 = (\\frac{1}{4})(\\hbar) + (\\frac{1}{2})(0) + (\\frac{1}{4})(-\\hbar) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$.\n\nThe expectation value of the square of the operator is:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = p_1 \\lambda_1^2 + p_2 \\lambda_2^2 + p_3 \\lambda_3^2 = (\\frac{1}{4})(\\hbar^2) + (\\frac{1}{2})(0^2) + (\\frac{1}{4})((-\\hbar)^2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\nThe uncertainty is:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The additional information about $P_x$ and $P_y$ confirms that the provided state is an eigenstate of $P_x$, but this information is not needed to calculate $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
