    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle, $X^0$. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. If it travels a shorter distance, the production and decay points are indistinguishable.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The relationship is given by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$):\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2}$\n    Given:\n    $E = 27$ GeV\n    $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n2.  **Average Decay Length ($L_{avg}$)**:\n    The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is the average decay length, $L_{avg}$. It is the product of the particle's speed ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n    $L_{avg} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    The particle's speed is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    So, $L_{avg} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n    We are given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    The product $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the given energies:\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{E}{m_0c^2})^2 - 1}$\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{(\\frac{27}{3.41})^2 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{62.693 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{61.693} \\approx 7.8545$\n    Now we can calculate the average decay length:\n    $L_{avg} = (7.8545) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s})$\n    $L_{avg} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n3.  **Exponential Decay and Resolution**:\n    Particle decay is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(\\text{length} > x) = e^{-x/L_{avg}}$.\n    We want to find the minimum resolution, let's call it $R_{min}$, such that at least 30% of the particles travel a distance greater than $R_{min}$ before they decay. This sets the condition:\n    $P(\\text{length} > R_{min}) = 0.30$\n    Substituting the formula for exponential decay:\n    $e^{-R_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\n    To solve for $R_{min}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{R_{min}}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $R_{min} = -L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    Using the value of $L_{avg}$ we calculated and $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n    $R_{min} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $R_{min} \\approx 2.269 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nLet's perform the calculation with higher precision using a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Calculate the average decay length in the lab frame (L_avg)\n# L_avg = beta * gamma * c * tau0\nL_avg = beta_gamma * c * tau0\n\n# 3. Calculate the minimum resolution R_min\n# The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance R_min before decaying is 30% (0.3).\n# P(l > R_min) = exp(-R_min / L_avg) = 0.3\n# Solving for R_min: R_min = -L_avg * ln(0.3)\nR_min = -L_avg * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{R_min:.2e}\")\n```\n2.27e-06\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

The slight difference (about 9%) might arise from using a slightly different value for the speed of light (e.g., $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s) or slight variations in the problem's constants. However, the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m) is correct, and the numerical value is the nearest among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution needed for a detector to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle $X^0$. To observe the decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### Step 1: Relativistic effects and particle lifetime\nThe particle $X^0$ has a proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. Since it is moving at a high speed in the laboratory (Bubble Chamber), its lifetime as measured by an observer in the lab is longer due to time dilation. This lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$) is given by:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$).\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass $m_{X^0} = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$, which means the rest mass energy $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the average decay length in the lab frame\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying depends on its speed ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$). The average distance, or mean decay length ($L_{avg}$), is:\n$L_{avg} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\nThe particle's speed is related to the Lorentz factor by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $v$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$L_{avg} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0$\nThe term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly from $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{(7.9179)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.693 - 1} \\approx 7.8545$\nNow we can calculate the average decay length, using the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$L_{avg} = (7.8545) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the minimum resolution from the decay probability\nThe decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives for a distance greater than or equal to $x$ is given by:\n$P(\\text{length} \\geq x) = e^{-x/L_{avg}}$\nWe want to find the minimum resolution ($R_{min}$) such that at least 30% (or 0.3) of the particles are observed to decay. This means we are looking for the distance $R_{min}$ that at least 30% of particles will travel *before* decaying.\nSo, we set the condition:\n$P(\\text{length} \\geq R_{min}) = 0.30$\n$e^{-R_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\nTo solve for $R_{min}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{R_{min}}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$R_{min} = -L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing the value $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$R_{min} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nTo ensure higher accuracy, let's use a script to perform the calculation with more precise values for the constants.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Calculate the minimum resolution R_min\n# P(length > R_min) = exp(-R_min / L_avg) = 0.3\nR_min = -L_avg * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated minimum resolution: {R_min:.3e} m\")\n```\nCalculated minimum resolution: 2.268e-06 m\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $R_{min} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Now, let's compare this with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options are different by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy (about 9%) between the calculated value and option C likely arises from minor rounding in the problem's given constants or options. Given the choices, C is unambiguously the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Based on the problem description and the output from the calculation, here is the final step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Summary of Method\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum spatial resolution ($R_{min}$) for a detector to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle $X^0$. An observed decay means the particle traveled a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying.\n\n1.  **Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is dilated relative to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n2.  **Average Decay Length ($L_{avg}$)**: The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is $L_{avg} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n3.  **Exponential Decay Law**: Particle decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $R$ before decaying is $P(\\text{length} \\geq R) = e^{-R/L_{avg}}$.\n4.  **Solving for Resolution**: We need to find the resolution $R_{min}$ such that this probability is 30% (or 0.3). We solve the equation $e^{-R_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.3$ for $R_{min}$. This gives $R_{min} = -L_{avg} \\ln(0.3)$.\n\n### Calculation and Conclusion\n\nThe Python code accurately implemented this method using the given values:\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light, $c = 299792458$ m/s\n\nThe output of the code was:\n`Calculated minimum resolution: 2.268e-06 m`\n\nThis means the minimum resolution required is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nNow, we compare this result to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nThe calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Both values are on the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m), while the other options differ by factors of a thousand or more. The small numerical difference between the calculated value and the option is likely due to rounding or a minor typo in the problem's given constants. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
