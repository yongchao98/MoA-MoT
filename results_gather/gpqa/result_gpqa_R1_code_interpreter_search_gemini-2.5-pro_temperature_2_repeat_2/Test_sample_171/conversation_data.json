    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem discusses the \"excitation\" of atoms in the photospheres of stars and relates it to their temperatures. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative population of atomic energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, an excited state (level i) and a lower energy state (level j).\n\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N_i, N_j are the number of atoms in states i and j.\n    *   g_i, g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   ΔE = E_i - E_j is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** Let's write the Boltzmann equation for the specific energy level in Star 1 (with temperature T_1) and Star 2 (with temperature T_2). We are comparing the same energy levels of the same element (iron), so the statistical weights (g_i, g_j) and the energy difference (ΔE) are the same for both stars.\n\n    *   For Star 1:  (N_i / N_j)_1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For Star 2:  (N_i / N_j)_2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Observational Data:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... compared to... star_2.\" This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for Star 1.\n\n    (N_i / N_j)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_j)_2\n\n    (Note: A higher excitation ratio implies a higher temperature, so we expect T_1 > T_2.)\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation and Solve:** Now, substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4.\n\n    (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g_i / g_j) is on both sides, so it cancels out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we need to get them out of the exponent. The best way to do this is by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the logarithm rule ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the terms to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term ΔE/k:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Use the Given Numerical Values:** The problem gives a crucial piece of information: \"the energy difference... was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\".\n    We know the Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    This means the pre-factor in our equation, ΔE/k, has a numerical value of 1. Let's check the units:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K.\n\n7.  **Finalize the Equation:** Substitute the value ΔE/k = 1 K into our derived equation:\n\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    When T_1 and T_2 are in Kelvin, the units on the left side are K * (K / K²) = dimensionless, which is consistent with ln(2) being dimensionless. So, we can write the equation without the explicit units:\n\n    [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** This final equation matches option C.\n\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]  (Incorrect denominator)\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]    (Incorrect numerator sign)\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]    (**Correct**)\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]                   (Incorrect form)\n\n<<<C>>>"
