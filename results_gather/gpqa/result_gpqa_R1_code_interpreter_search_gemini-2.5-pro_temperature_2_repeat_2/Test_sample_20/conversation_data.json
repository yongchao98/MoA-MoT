    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most common form, involving the migration of a proton from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-carbon) to the carbonyl oxygen atom. For this to occur, the molecule must possess at least one **alpha-hydrogen**.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups (ketones) at opposite positions (para).\n        *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). These are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds.\n        *   Crucially, these alpha-carbons are bonded to other carbons within the ring structure and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n        *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons, located between the carbonyl groups. Each of these is a -CH₂- group.\n        *   These carbons possess two alpha-hydrogens each. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, the molecule can readily tautomerize to its enol form. In fact, it can tautomerize three times to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors the aromatic enol form.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** exhibit tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry around the C=C double bond.\n        *   The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and a center of inversion. It also possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms).\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, it is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
