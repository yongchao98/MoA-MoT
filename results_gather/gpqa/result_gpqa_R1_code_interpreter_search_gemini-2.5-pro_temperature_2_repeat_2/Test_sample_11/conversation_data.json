    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Physics Principles:**\nThe decay of a particle at rest is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations:**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Particle: Positive Pion (Pi+)\n    *   State: Stationary (at rest).\n    *   Initial Momentum (p_initial): 0\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial): This is purely its rest mass energy, E_pi = m_pi * c^2.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Particles: Positive Muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Final Momentum (p_final): The vector sum of the muon's momentum (p_mu) and the neutrino's momentum (p_nu).\n        *   p_final = p_mu + p_nu\n    *   Final Energy (E_final): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        *   E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n        *   The total energy of a particle is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy (KE). So, E_mu = m_mu*c^2 + KE_mu and E_nu = m_nu*c^2 + KE_nu.\n        *   Neutrinos (nu) are considered massless (m_nu ≈ 0) in this context. Therefore, their rest mass energy is zero, and their total energy is purely kinetic (E_nu = KE_nu).\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:**\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = p_mu + p_nu\n    *   This implies p_mu = -p_nu. This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this magnitude by 'p', so |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_pi * c^2 = (m_mu*c^2 + KE_mu) + E_nu\n    *   We can also write the final energies in terms of momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n        *   For the massive muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 )\n        *   For the massless neutrino: E_nu = sqrt( (p_nu*c)^2 + 0 ) = p_nu*c = pc. (Note: this confirms E_nu = KE_nu)\n    *   Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n        m_pi * c^2 = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ) + pc\n\n**4. Solve for the Unknowns:**\n\nOur goal is to find KE_mu and KE_nu. Let's first solve the energy equation for the momentum term, pc.\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    m_pi*c^2 - pc = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 )\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    (m_pi*c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n3.  The (pc)^2 terms on both sides cancel out:\n    (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(pc) = (m_mu*c^2)^2\n4.  Isolate the 'pc' term:\n    (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(pc)\n    pc = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi+ (m_pi * c^2) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of mu+ (m_mu * c^2) = 105.7 MeV\n\nWe can now use a python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi+ in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu+ in MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc)\nnumerator = m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2\ndenominator = 2 * m_pi_c2\npc = numerator / denominator\n\n# --- Calculate the Kinetic Energies ---\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon is E_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu = m_pi_c2 - pc\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - KE_nu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\n> Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): 29.79 MeV\n\nThe calculated values are approximately:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
