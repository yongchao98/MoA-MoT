    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical structure of the given compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon Atoms (C):**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   =CH-: 1 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH=: 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C.\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen Atoms (H):**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =CH-: 1 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH=: 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to count all the single C-C bonds, double C=C bonds, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The formula explicitly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2. So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can deduce the number of C-C single bonds. An acyclic molecule has a total of (number of atoms - 1) bonds.\n    *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n    *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33 bonds.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (C-H bonds) - (C=C bonds) = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom_compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atom_compound = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_CH) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_CC) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\n\n*   Given Bond Energies (BE):\n    *   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\n*   Calculation:\n    *   ΔH_atom_compound = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\n    *   ΔH_atom_compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600\n    *   ΔH_atom_compound = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements (ΔH_atom_elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to form the gaseous atoms (12 C(g) and 22 H(g)) from the elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe atomization of elements is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nΔH_atom_elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n\n*   Given Enthalpies:\n    *   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n    *   Bond energy of H-H, BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\n*   Calculation:\n    *   ΔH_atom_elements = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\n    *   ΔH_atom_elements = 12000 + 1100\n    *   ΔH_atom_elements = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) can be found using Hess's Law, relating it to the enthalpies of atomization.\nΔHf = ΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\n\n*   Calculation:\n    *   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n    *   ΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Compare with Given Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is ΔH_atom_compound)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option D has the number 1900 but the units are kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option A.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass (M) of C12H22:**\n    *   M = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Using integer masses: M = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n\nLet's perform the division.\n```python\nprint(1900 / 166)\n```\n<execute_result>\n11.44578313253012\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the division is approximately 11.45 kJ/g, which matches option A (11.44 kJ/g) very closely. Option D is incorrect due to the units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
