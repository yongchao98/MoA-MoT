    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the input variables and relationships.**\n    *   The problem gives a relationship between the \"number of stars\" (let's call this `N`) and parallax (`plx`).\n    *   The relationship is given as `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of distance\" relates to distance (`r`). This quantity is the derivative of the total number of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n    *   We also need the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax: `plx = 1/r`. This means parallax is inversely proportional to distance.\n\n2.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.**\n    *   We start with the given relation: `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   We substitute the parallax-distance relation (`plx = 1/r`) into this expression.\n    *   `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   `N ∝ r⁵`\n\n3.  **Interpret the meaning of N.**\n    *   Since parallax (`plx`) decreases as distance (`r`) increases, the quantity `N ∝ r⁵` means the number of stars increases with distance.\n    *   In astrophysics, when a number count `N` is given as a function of a limit like distance or parallax, it typically represents the **cumulative number** of objects within that limit.\n    *   So, `N(r) ∝ r⁵` represents the total number of stars within a sphere of radius `r`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars per unit distance.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars ... per unit range of distance, r\". This is the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`, which mathematically corresponds to the derivative of the cumulative number `N(r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   Let's write the proportionality as an equation with a constant `C`: `N(r) = C * r⁵`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n        `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n    *   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n5.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    *   The result is `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`.\n    *   Comparing this with the options:\n        A) ~ r²\n        B) ~ r⁴\n        C) ~ r³\n        D) ~ r⁵\n    *   The result matches option B.\n\nWe can also use a symbolic calculation in Python to verify this differentiation.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for parallax, distance, and a proportionality constant\nplx, r, C = sympy.symbols('plx r C')\n\n# 1. Given relationship: N is proportional to plx^-5.\n# This represents the cumulative number of stars up to a certain distance (corresponding to a minimum parallax).\n# We can write this as N(plx) = C * plx**-5\nN_of_plx = C * plx**-5\n\n# 2. Relationship between parallax and distance: plx = 1/r\n# Substitute this into the equation for N to get N as a function of r.\nN_of_r = N_of_plx.subs(plx, 1/r)\n\n# N_of_r is now the cumulative number of stars within distance r.\n# simplify(N_of_r) would give C*r**5\n\n# 3. The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr.\n# We differentiate N(r) with respect to r.\ndN_dr = sympy.diff(N_of_r, r)\n\n# The resulting expression shows the proportionality with r.\n# sympy.simplify(dN_dr) gives 5*C*r**4.\n# This means dN/dr is proportional to r**4.\n\nprint(\"The number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.\")\nprint(f\"The symbolic derivative is: {sympy.simplify(dN_dr)}\")\n```\nThe reasoning and calculation both point to the number of stars per unit distance being proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks how the number of stars per unit distance, which we can denote as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    *   The number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`. This can be written as `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`). The formula is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   We start with the given relationship: `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   Substitute the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) into the equation:\n        `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   Simplifying the exponent, we get:\n        `N ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This expression `N(r) ∝ r⁵` represents the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars ... per unit range of distance\". This is equivalent to finding the density of stars at a particular distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    *   Let's write the proportionality as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n        `N(r) = k * r⁵`\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r` using the power rule of differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   From this result, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr ∝ r⁴` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
