    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n2.  **Extract the given information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the key physical principles:** The problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. A crucial piece of information is that they are also \"eclipsing.\"\n    *   For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M_total = M_a + M_b) can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n    *   The formula is: M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K_a + K_b)³ / (sin i)³, where `P` is the period, `G` is the gravitational constant, `K_a` and `K_b` are the velocity semi-amplitudes, and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   The fact that the systems are eclipsing means the inclination `i` is very close to 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and `sin³(i) = 1`. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly, as we can assume this term is 1 for both systems.\n\n4.  **Set up the mass calculation for each system:**\n    *   The simplified formula for the total mass is: M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³. The constant of proportionality is 1 / (2 * π * G), but this will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n    *   First, calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K_total) for each system:\n        *   **System 1:** K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n        *   **System 2:** K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n5.  **Form the ratio of the total masses:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2.\n    *   M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n    *   This can be rewritten as: (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)³\n\n6.  **Substitute the values and compute the result:**\n    *   P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n    *   K1_total / K2_total = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5\n    *   Now, plug these into the ratio formula:\n    *   Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³ = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** To compare with the given options, we'll convert the fraction to a decimal. This can be done with a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# Values for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Values for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = P1 / P2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total velocity amplitudes\nvelocity_ratio = K1_total / K2_total\n\n# The ratio of the total masses is (P1/P2) * (K1_total/K2_total)^3\nmass_ratio = period_ratio * (velocity_ratio)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n>>>0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary system is given by the formula derived from Kepler's third law:\n\n`M_total = (P / (2 * pi * G)) * (K_a + K_b)^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K_a` and `K_b` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nWe assume the inclination angle `i` is 90 degrees since the systems are eclipsing, which simplifies the formula by making `sin(i) = 1`.\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, `M_sys1 / M_sys2`.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   `P1 = 2` years\n*   `K1a = 10` km/s\n*   `K1b = 5` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: `K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   `P2 = 1` year\n*   `K2a = 15` km/s\n*   `K2b = 10` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: `K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, let's set up the ratio `M_sys1 / M_sys2`:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [ (P1 * (K1_total)^3) / (2 * pi * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_total)^3) / (2 * pi * G) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(2 * pi * G)` cancels out, leaving:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)^3`\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)^3`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated ratio is `0.432`, which is approximately `0.4`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
