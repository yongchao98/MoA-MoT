    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L_J`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S', which corresponds to orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is 0, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity and isospin of the initial state.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum `L` is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n    *   Antisymmetry `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1` which implies `L+S+T` must be odd.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which means the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Described by `(2S_f+1)L_f_{J_f}`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity `P_i=+1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X)=-1`, and the orbital parity of X's motion `(-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f+l_X+1} = +1`. This means `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, or `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n    *   Given `T_f(NN)=0`, the rule simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n4.  **Validity of the Final State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). This means `2S_f+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1`. This means `2S_f+1=7`, so `S_f=3`.\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Violation)**\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state, which is a key selection rule mentioned explicitly in the problem.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if a state is unphysical (like in A), it is often considered a typo. If we assume it was a typo for a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted (as `S=1, L=2, J=1; l_X=1` would satisfy all rules). The question prominently features the Pauli statistics requirement, suggesting that the test is focused on applying this specific rule. Option C is the only one that represents a transition to a physically possible state (`3P0` is valid) but is forbidden specifically by this Pauli principle selection rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
