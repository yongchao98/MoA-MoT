    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide (like 1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (like NaNH₂) proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, specifically involving a **benzyne** (or aryne) intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the ortho positions to C1 (which has Br) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. These two possibilities lead to two different reaction pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This is a slower process than abstracting H⁺ but is still a possible reaction pathway.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this benzyne intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The intermediate is unsymmetrical due to the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, the carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2, making them *meta* to each other).\n        *   So, Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion, which upon protonation gives a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B yields one product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   Combining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n        1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    *   These are three structurally distinct organic molecules. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
