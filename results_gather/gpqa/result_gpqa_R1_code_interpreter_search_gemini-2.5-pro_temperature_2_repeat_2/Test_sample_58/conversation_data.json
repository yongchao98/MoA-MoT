    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the acid-base neutralization reactions occurring in the mixture.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of the acidic and basic species present in the initial solutions.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH, a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl, a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2, a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-. Note that each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**Summary of Initial Moles:**\n*   Total moles of acid species = Moles of CH3COOH + Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.050 mol + 0.080 mol = 0.130 mol\n*   Total moles of base species (OH-) = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH-) will react first with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    *   We have 0.080 mol of H+ and 0.180 mol of OH-. The H+ will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   We have 0.050 mol of CH3COOH and 0.100 mol of OH- remaining. The CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.050 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate pH:**\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains:\n*   Excess OH- (a strong base) = 0.050 mol\n*   CH3COO- (a weak base) = 0.050 mol\n\nThe pH of the final solution will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base (OH-). The contribution of the weak base (CH3COO-) to the overall hydroxide concentration is negligible in the presence of a much stronger base.\n\n*   **Calculate the final volume:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300 * 2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization reactions\n# Strong acid vs strong base\noh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\n# Weak acid vs remaining strong base\noh_excess = oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: pH calculation\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nconcentration_oh_excess = oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npoh = -math.log10(concentration_oh_excess)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"{ph=:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem involves mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH depends on which species is in excess after the neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles of Each Species:**\n*   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = Volume (L) × Molarity (mol/L) = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.050 mol\n*   **HCl (strong acid):**\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates to give H⁺.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.080 mol\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it completely dissociates to give 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform Neutralization Reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all the available acid, neutralizing the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, followed by the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid = Moles of H⁺ from HCl + Moles of CH3COOH**\n    Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n*   **Total moles of base = Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**\n    Total base = 0.180 mol\n\nNow, we compare the total moles of acid and base.\nSince moles of base (0.180 mol) > moles of acid (0.130 mol), the final solution will be basic, and there will be excess OH⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    Excess OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH:**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    In an aqueous solution at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
