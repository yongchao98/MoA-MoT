    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   'n' is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   'σ' (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, within the same sample compartment. Since the compartment volume, temperature, and pressure are constant (before the beam is on), the number density 'n' of the residual gas molecules is the same for both scenarios.\n\n    *   **λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision):** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction σ1.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n        (Note: For identical particles in thermal motion, a factor of √2 is often included, i.e., λ = 1/(√2*n*σ), but this detail doesn't change the final comparison.)\n        σ1 is the *gas-kinetic cross-section*, which is related to the physical size (diameter, d) of the gas molecules. The interaction is like a \"billiard ball\" collision. σ1 is approximately πd².\n\n    *   **λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the high-energy beam colliding (or more accurately, scattering) with the stationary gas molecules. Let's call the scattering cross-section for this interaction σ2.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n        σ2 is the *electron scattering cross-section*. This is not determined by the physical size in the same way. It's determined by the electromagnetic interaction between the high-energy electron and the electric field of the gas molecule (its nucleus and its electron cloud).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    The comparison between λ1 and λ2 boils down to the comparison between σ1 and σ2. From the formulas above:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n\n    *   **σ1 (Gas-Kinetic):** Molecules are neutral and interact via short-range forces. The cross-section is determined by their physical size. For a typical gas like N2, the kinetic diameter is about 0.37 nm, leading to a cross-section σ1 of roughly 4 x 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron Scattering):** The electron in the TEM has a very high energy (1000 keV = 1 MeV). High-energy charged particles are extremely penetrating. They can pass very close to or even through an atom without a significant interaction (i.e., without being scattered significantly). The probability of an interaction, and thus the scattering cross-section σ2, is very small for such energetic electrons. The cross-section for scattering decreases significantly as the electron's energy increases. For a 1 MeV electron scattering off a nitrogen atom, the total cross-section (elastic + inelastic) is on the order of 10⁻²² to 10⁻²³ m².\n\n4.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    We have established that the gas-kinetic cross-section (σ1) is much larger than the high-energy electron scattering cross-section (σ2).\n    σ1 >> σ2\n    In fact, σ1 is several orders of magnitude (thousands of times) larger than σ2.\n\n    Since λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2, and σ1 / σ2 >> 1, it follows that:\n    λ2 >> λ1\n\n    This means the mean free path of the electrons in the residual gas is much, much longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small amount (less than 22%). This contradicts our finding that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect because the collision types and cross-sections are vastly different.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that the tiny, high-energy electron is *more* likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, which is physically wrong.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option states that λ2 is at least 22% larger than λ1. Since our physical analysis concluded that λ2 is thousands of times larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ1. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physics of the situation. The number 1.22 is likely arbitrary, but the inequality holds true.\n\n<<<D>>>"
