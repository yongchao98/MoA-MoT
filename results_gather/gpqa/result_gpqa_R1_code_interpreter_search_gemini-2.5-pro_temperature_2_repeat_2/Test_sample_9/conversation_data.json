    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density in celestial bodies.**\n    Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) per unit volume (V), or ρ = M/V. For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n    A key factor influencing a planet's density is its composition (what it's made of) and the gravitational compression it experiences due to its own mass. For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity, which compresses the material more, leading to a higher overall density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference planet, Earth. Its average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's use this as our baseline density, ρ_earth ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly in the question. The density is ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is a \"Super-Earth\". Since it has the same composition as Earth (a mix of rock and iron), its density is primarily determined by its mass. With five times the mass of Earth, its gravitational force will be much stronger, causing its internal materials to be significantly more compressed. This compression increases the overall density. Therefore, its density will be greater than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is a \"sub-Earth\". It has the same composition as Earth but less mass. Consequently, its self-gravity is weaker, and the materials it's made of will be less compressed than on Earth. This results in a lower overall density compared to Earth. Its density will be less than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the only one that is definitively denser than Earth. Planets (a) and (b) have densities very close to Earth's, and planet (d) is less dense. Therefore, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive has the highest density.\n\nTo illustrate with a calculation, we can use the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.28.\nLet ρ_e, M_e, and R_e be the density, mass, and radius of Earth.\nFor planet (c), M_c = 5 * M_e.\nIts radius would be R_c ≈ R_e * (5)^0.28 ≈ 1.57 * R_e.\nThe density is ρ = M / V ∝ M / R³.\nSo, the ratio of planet c's density to Earth's density is:\nρ_c / ρ_e = (M_c/M_e) / (R_c/R_e)³ = 5 / (1.57)³ ≈ 5 / 3.87 ≈ 1.29.\nThis means ρ_c ≈ 1.29 * ρ_e, or about 7.1 g/cm³, which is significantly higher than the others.\n\n<<<C>>>"
