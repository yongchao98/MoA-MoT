    "This problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. To do this, we'll use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and account for the information provided about their radii, peak emission wavelengths, and radial velocities.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is given by  $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$ , where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and  $\\sigma$  is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the star's surface temperature (T) to the intrinsic wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ( $\\lambda_{max, emit}$ ). The formula is  $\\lambda_{max, emit} = b/T$ , where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Shift:** The observed wavelength ( $\\lambda_{obs}$ ) from a source moving with radial velocity ( $v_r$ ) is related to the emitted wavelength ( $\\lambda_{emit}$ ) by the Doppler effect. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the non-relativistic approximation is accurate:  $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$ . A positive  $v_r$  (receding) causes a redshift (longer wavelength), and a negative  $v_r$  (approaching) causes a blueshift (shorter wavelength).\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   Radius ratio:  $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$ \n    *   Mass ratio:  $M_1 / M_2 = 1.5$  (This is extra information not needed for this specific calculation).\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_1:  $v_{r,1} = 0$  km/s\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_2:  $v_{r,2} = 700$  km/s\n    *   The crucial piece of information is that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelengths. So,  $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$ .\n\n3.  **Calculate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We want to find the ratio  $L_1 / L_2$ .\n    \n    $L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    \n    This simplifies to:\n    \n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$ \n\n    We already know  $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$ . Now we need to find the temperature ratio,  $(T_1/T_2)$ .\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    The temperature of a star determines its intrinsic peak emission wavelength ( $\\lambda_{max, emit}$ ) according to Wien's Law.\n    \n    $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$\n    $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max, emit, 2}$\n\n    We must relate the intrinsic (emitted) wavelengths to the observed wavelengths using the Doppler shift formula.\n\n    *   For Star_1: Since  $v_{r,1} = 0$ , there is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$ \n    *   For Star_2: With  $v_{r,2} = 700$  km/s, its light is redshifted.\n        $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are equal:  $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$ .\n    Therefore:\n    \n    $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    Now, we can find the relationship between the temperatures using Wien's law:\n    \n    $(b/T_1) = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    $1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    $T_2/T_1 = (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    The temperature ratio we need for the luminosity equation is  $T_1/T_2$:\n    \n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    \n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n    \n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the values and compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius_ratio = 1.5\nv_r2 = 700  # in km/s\nc = 3e5  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n# L1/L2 = (radius_ratio)^2 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4\n\ndenominator = (1 + v_r2 / c) ** 4\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio ** 2) / denominator\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An astronomer is interested in determining the luminosities of two stars. The information for Star_1 and Star_2 is provided. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times the mass of Star_2. Through spectroscopic analysis, the astronomer has determined that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are identical. In addition, the radial velocities of Star_1 and Star_2 have been measured to be 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, it has been calculated that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of what value?\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2, denoted as L1/L2.\n\n2.  **Governing Equation for Luminosity:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   R is the star's radius.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio L1/L2, we can write:\n    L1/L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L1/L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Given Information:** From the problem statement, we have:\n    *   R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    *   M₁/M₂ = 1.5 (Note: The mass ratio is extraneous information for this specific problem).\n    *   The observed wavelengths of maximum brightness are equal: λobs,1 = λobs,2\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 1 is v₁ = 0 km/s.\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 2 is v₂ = 700 km/s.\n\n5.  **Relating Temperature and Wavelength:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the effective surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which it *emits* the most radiation (λemit):\n    T = b / λemit\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n\n    From this, we can establish a ratio for the temperatures of the two stars:\n    T₁/T₂ = (b/λemit,1) / (b/λemit,2) = λemit,2 / λemit,1\n\n6.  **Connecting Observed and Emitted Wavelengths:** The observed wavelength (λobs) is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect. The relationship is:\n    λobs = λemit * (1 + v/c)\n    where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n    *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0):\n        λobs,1 = λemit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λemit,1\n    *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s):\n        λobs,2 = λemit,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We are given that λobs,1 = λobs,2. Therefore:\n    λemit,1 = λemit,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Rearranging this gives us the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n    λemit,2 / λemit,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λemit,2 / λemit,1, we now have the temperature ratio in terms of known values:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute all the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1/L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L1/L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s)⁴\n\n    This calculation can be performed accurately using a short script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius_ratio = 1.5\nv_r2 = 700  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nc = 3.0e5   # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c) because their observed peak wavelengths are the same.\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) / (1 + v_r2 / c)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is approximately 2.229. This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 2.23. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Fundamental Equations:**\n    *   The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   The peak wavelength of emission ($\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}$) is related to the temperature by **Wien's Displacement Law**: $T = b/\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}$) by the **Doppler Effect**: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emit}}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio $L_1/L_2$.\n    $L_1/L_2 = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    The constants cancel, leaving:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Determine the Component Ratios from the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** We need to find $(T_1/T_2)$.

So, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emit, 2}}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{\\text{emit, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emit, 2}}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{\\text{emit, 2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{emit, 1}} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   This gives us the temperature ratio:\n        $(T_1/T_2) = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n    We can now plug in the numbers and calculate the result. The mass information is irrelevant to this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\n# Ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv_r2 = 700.0\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 3.0e5\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# We found that the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio term raised to the 4th power\ntemp_ratio_term = (1.0 / (1.0 + v_r2 / c)) ** 4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio ** 2) * temp_ratio_term\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the final numerical value for the luminosity ratio based on the derived formula.
