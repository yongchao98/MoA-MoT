    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4), which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of the two compounds.\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals in both the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) and the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm). The signals are all described as singlets, which is a crucial clue about the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecules.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three distinct singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, producing a pair of **doublets** (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets, **Prehnitene can be eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent, producing a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Elimination**\n\n*   Options B and C include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene), which is incorrect because it would produce doublets in the aromatic region.\n*   Option A includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect because it would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n\nBy this process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n**4. Verify the Spectrum of the Mixture in Option D**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of Durene and Isodurene matches the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The first 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n        *   The second 6H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. For 4 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **2H and 2H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The first 2H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The second 2H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination strongly points to Option D. Verifying the combined spectrum of this mixture shows that it is fully consistent with the observed data, assuming two plausible instances of accidental signal overlap, a common phenomenon in NMR spectroscopy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
