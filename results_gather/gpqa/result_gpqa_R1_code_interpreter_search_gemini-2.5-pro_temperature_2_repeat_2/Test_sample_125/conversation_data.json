    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong, non-selective reducing agent.\n*   **Product:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol (-OH group). The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The starting material has one chiral center (C5). The reaction creates a new one (C3). The starting material is (5S).\n    *   The hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new C3 center: (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of two ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** Both ketone groups are reduced, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   We need to determine the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetrical about C3, we need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) because of the identical substituents on C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. (Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I, diastereomer of 1)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, enantiomer of 3)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Each HPLC Experiment\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties. It will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will all elute at different times.\n*   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Chiral HPLC can do everything a normal-phase column can do (separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers), but it can **also separate enantiomers**.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of five unique stereoisomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of the above) will give a separate **1 peak**.\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of the above) will now be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer (diastereomer of the others) and will have its own retention time, giving **1 peak**.\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
