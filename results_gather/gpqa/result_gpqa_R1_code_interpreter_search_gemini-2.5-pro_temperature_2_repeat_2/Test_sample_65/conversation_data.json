    "*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a relativistic quantum field theory. A fundamental postulate of such theories is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. This is the principle of relativity, which is mathematically described by Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). This symmetry must be respected.\n\n*   **2. Poincare symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes spacetime translations. Just like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that must be respected by any relativistic field theory, including the SMEFT. The Lagrangian density must be invariant under the Poincare group to ensure that physical laws are independent of where and when an experiment is performed. Since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, respecting Poincare symmetry automatically implies respecting Lorentz symmetry.\n\n*   **3. CP symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P) symmetry. It is well-established experimentally that CP symmetry is violated in the weak interactions of the Standard Model (e.g., in the decay of neutral kaons and B mesons). The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the SM contains a complex phase that is the source of this violation. Since the SMEFT is an extension of the SM and aims to parameterize all possible new physics at higher energies, it is not required to preserve CP symmetry. In fact, many higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can provide new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP is *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all SMEFT operators.\n\n*   **4. CPT symmetry:** CPT symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T) symmetry. The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under CPT transformations. The SMEFT is constructed to satisfy these conditions. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to items 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
