    "The user wants to complete the following statement:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of oxygen's role as an oxidizing agent.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics**\n\nThermodynamic strength as an oxidant is determined by the standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic solutions to that in acidic solutions.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:** The reduction half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n*   **In basic solution:** The reduction half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two E° values:\nE° (acidic, +1.23 V) > E° (basic, +0.40 V)\n\nThis means that oxygen is a thermodynamically stronger oxidant in acidic solution and a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\nTherefore, the first blank should be \"weaker\". This eliminates options C) and D).\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics**\n\nKinetics refers to the rate of a reaction. The statement asks about how fast oxygen reacts in acidic solutions.\n\n*   The reduction of a diatomic oxygen molecule (O₂) to water involves the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of a very strong double bond (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol).\n*   Processes that involve multiple electron transfers and the breaking of strong covalent bonds typically have high activation energies.\n*   This high activation energy barrier makes the reduction of oxygen kinetically unfavorable, meaning the reaction is inherently **slower**. This is often referred to as a high overpotential for oxygen reduction. In practical applications like fuel cells, expensive catalysts (e.g., platinum) are required to speed up this sluggish reaction.\n\nTherefore, the second blank should be \"slower\".\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<A>>>"
