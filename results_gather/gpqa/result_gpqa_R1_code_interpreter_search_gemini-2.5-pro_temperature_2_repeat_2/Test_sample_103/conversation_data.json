    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be redshifted when it moves away from us and blueshifted when it moves towards us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift formula is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity (its velocity component along our line of sight), and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem states the *periodic shift of a spectral line* is \"up to\" a certain value. This maximum shift, $(\\Delta\\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity amplitude, $K$.\n    $$ K \\propto (\\Delta\\lambda)_{max} $$\n    We are given:\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max}}{(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude of the host star can be expressed as:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze the System Parameters:** The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem's structure implies that other factors are constant. A definitive answer requires assuming the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems. We can write the proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}} $$\n    This means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** From the proportionality, we can set up a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{1/P_2^{1/3}}{1/P_1^{1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Result:** Now, we substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n    So,\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n    ```python\n    print((5/7)**3)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    0.3644314868804665\n    </execute_result>\n\n    The result is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
