    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity.\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Cavity Wall:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor towards it. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net flux through this surface to be zero, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this $-q$ charge will be non-uniform, arranging itself to perfectly cancel the field of the $+q$ charge for all points outside the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral (zero total charge). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the cavity ($+q$) and on the cavity wall ($-q$) arrange themselves in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means an observer outside the conductor cannot tell where the charge $+q$ is located inside the cavity. The only field they experience comes from the charges on the outer surface.\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** For a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like the uniform $+q$ on the outer surface of the sphere), the electric field at any external point is the same as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (a result from Gauss's Law, often called the Shell Theorem).\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{effective}}{distance^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The information regarding the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance of P from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) is all irrelevant to the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
