    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system is composed of two electrons in a p orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In the simpler notation $|l, m\\rangle$, this is the state $|2, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator $L^2$ and the total z-component of the angular momentum operator $L_z$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number (the z-component) is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenstates of these operators form the *uncoupled* basis, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$, or more simply $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1. The possible values for $m_1$ and $m_2$ are -1, 0, and 1.\n\n3.  **Identify the desired outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$. Let's call this outcome state $|\\phi\\rangle = |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Connect the measurement to quantum mechanical principles:** The probability of obtaining a specific outcome is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the outcome state.\n    *   Probability $P = |\\langle \\text{outcome state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our notation: $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum:** The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. Both the coupled and uncoupled basis states are eigenstates of this total operator $L_z$.\n    *   For the initial coupled state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, the eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   For the uncoupled outcome state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$, the eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + (-1))\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\n6.  **Use orthogonality of eigenstates:** According to a fundamental theorem of linear algebra and quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   The initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The outcome state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   Since the eigenvalues are different ($-1\\hbar \\neq -2\\hbar$), the states are orthogonal. This means their inner product is zero:\n        $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability is the square of this inner product.\n    *   $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result is also evident from the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the coefficients that expand a coupled state in terms of uncoupled states:\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$.\nThe coefficient $\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$. In our case, we are looking for the coefficient for the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$. For this state, $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. The initial state has $m=-1$. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
