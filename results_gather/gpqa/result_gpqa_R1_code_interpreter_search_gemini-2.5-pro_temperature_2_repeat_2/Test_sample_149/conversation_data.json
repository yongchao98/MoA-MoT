    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the initial compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves 1 DBE, which corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1=3, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment and the C=O group.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the ring is substituted with electron-donating groups.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. An amine is an electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for two protons, which corresponds to the -CH2- group coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), as established from the aldehyde signal.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    Putting all the pieces together (a *para*-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C8H9NO matches this structure (C6H4 for the ring, NH2, and C2H3O for the side chain).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    \n    `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (NaNO2, HCl) -->  Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (hydrolysis)**\n    Warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    \n    `Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (H2O, Heat) -->  HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + HCl`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct.\n        \n        Aldol Adduct: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n        \n        `2 * HO-C6H4-CH2CHO --(KOH)--> HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with \"Heat\". In aldol reactions, heating the aldol adduct in the presence of base causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is because the resulting conjugated system is thermodynamically very stable. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated.\n        \n        `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n        Final Product: The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the aldol adduct (D), but because heat is applied, the final, stable product is the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
