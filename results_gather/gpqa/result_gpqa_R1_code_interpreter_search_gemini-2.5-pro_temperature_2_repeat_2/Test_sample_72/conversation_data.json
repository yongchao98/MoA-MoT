    "Here's the step-by-step derivation for the solution:\n\n### **Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as observed from a single reference frame, their relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{|v_1 - v_2|}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy ($E$) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate its energy, $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate its energy, $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy is the sum of $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   $v_{rel} = 0.14c$\n*   $E = 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
