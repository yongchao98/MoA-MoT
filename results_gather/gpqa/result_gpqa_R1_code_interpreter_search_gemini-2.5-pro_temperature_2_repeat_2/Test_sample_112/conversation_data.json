    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which is consistent with the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]+.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]+ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Data:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To differentiate between these, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules containing C, H, and O).\n    *   The structure must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C double bond in the alkene part of the molecule.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **C6H10O2 (A)**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This is consistent with our findings (one C=O and one C=C).\n        *   For **C6H12O2 (C)**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This molecule is saturated except for one double bond (or a ring). It cannot contain both a C=O and a C=C double bond. For example, hexanoic acid (C6H12O2) has a -COOH group but no C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only chemical formula that fits all the analytical data is C6H10O2. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms required for the carboxylic acid, and it has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
