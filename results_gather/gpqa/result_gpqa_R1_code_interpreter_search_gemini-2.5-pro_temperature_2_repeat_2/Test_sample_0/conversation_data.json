    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\n\nThis problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which we can simultaneously know the energy of a quantum state and its lifetime. The principle is expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nHere, ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the natural linewidth), Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For our purpose, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\nWe are given two quantum states with the following lifetimes:\n*   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n\nFor each state, there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy level due to its finite lifetime.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:**\n    *   For state 1, the lifetime Δt₁ = τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        The energy uncertainty is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For state 2, the lifetime Δt₂ = τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        The energy uncertainty is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels:**\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than their combined uncertainty. A common criterion for resolving two spectral lines is that their separation must be greater than the sum of their individual widths (in this case, the energy uncertainties ΔE₁ and ΔE₂).\n\n    Condition for resolution: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n3.  **Calculate the minimum required energy difference:**\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    Minimum energy difference ≈ (6.582 + 0.6582) x 10⁻⁷ eV ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    Alternatively, a simpler (and also valid) condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the width of the broader line. The broader line corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁), so its width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Even with this less strict condition, the required energy difference is of the order of 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Compare the required energy difference with the given options:**\n    The energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than approximately 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    C) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels given their lifetime-induced energy broadening.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle\n# Delta_E approx hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be\n# greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy difference required for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-8,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-9,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\n# Check which option satisfies the condition\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is not large enough for resolution.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
