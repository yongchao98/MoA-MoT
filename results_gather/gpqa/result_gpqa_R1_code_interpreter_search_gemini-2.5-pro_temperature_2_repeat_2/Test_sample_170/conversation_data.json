    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position of electrophilic attack (in this case, by Br+). They are classified as either *ortho, para*-directors or *meta*-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating), with the exception of halogens which are deactivating.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors by Para-Isomer Yield\nSubstances with *meta*-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the *para*-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely proportional to the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the more selective it is for the *meta* position, and the less *para*-isomer will be formed.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the *para*-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield(C6H5-NO2) < Yield(C6H5-COOH) < Yield(C6H5-COOC2H5)\n\nUsing the numbers for the substances, this gives us the beginning of our sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors by Para-Isomer Yield\nSubstances with *ortho, para*-directing groups will produce a high percentage of the *para*-isomer. The exact percentage depends on a balance of electronic and steric effects. The *para* position is generally favored over the *ortho* position to minimize steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   The -CH3 group (in 1) and -C2H5 group (in 5) are both alkyl groups that are *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the *ortho* positions makes the *para* position even more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the percentage yield of the *para*-isomer for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n    *   This gives us the relationship: Yield(1) < Yield(5).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is also an *ortho, para*-director. While it deactivates the ring overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), it directs *ortho, para* because its lone pairs can participate in resonance (+M).\n    *   The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the *ortho* positions more significantly than the *para* position. This electronic factor leads to a very high selectivity for the *para* isomer in halobenzenes.\n    *   Experimental data shows that bromination of toluene (1) yields about 66% *para*-isomer, while bromination of chlorobenzene (3) yields about 87% *para*-isomer. So, Yield(1) < Yield(3).\n    *   The final comparison is between ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). This is a contest between the steric effect of the ethyl group and the electronic effect of the chloro group. Depending on reaction conditions, the values can vary. However, a common line of reasoning in such problems is to consider the electronic effect of the halogen to be extremely effective at promoting para substitution. If we follow the logic that leads to one of the provided answers, the high para-selectivity of chlorobenzene places it at the top. This implies the ordering: Yield(1) < Yield(5) < Yield(3).\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n1.  We established the order for the *meta*-directors (lowest para yield): **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2.  We established the order for the *ortho, para*-directors (highest para yield): **1 < 5 < 3**.\n3.  Combining these two sequences, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
