    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n1.  **Presence of a chiral center (stereocenter):** A carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Axial chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyls or allenes.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') of both phenyl rings. The groups are nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3).\n*   **Rotation:** These large groups clash with each other, sterically hindering the free rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Chirality:** Because of this restricted rotation, the rings are forced to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion because each ring is asymmetrically substituted. The mirror image of the molecule is therefore non-superimposable on the original molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule exhibits axial chirality and is optically active.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R- and S-isomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of two phenyl rings attached to a central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. A molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n*   **Chirality:** Since it is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the substituents are in a *trans* arrangement across the double bond.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. The plane containing all the atoms acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
