    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system remains constant throughout the motion. The system is the mass under the influence of the spring force.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy:** In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic energy. A consistent formulation for the conserved total energy of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a mass attached to a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n3.  **Total Conserved Energy:** The total conserved energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n4.  **Analyze Two Key Points in the Oscillation:** We can find the value of this constant total energy by analyzing the system at a point where we know all the variables. Then we can use this value to solve for the unknown variable at another point. The two most convenient points are the position of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (amplitude):**\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (center of oscillation):**\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   The potential energy is minimum ($U(0) = 0$), so the kinetic energy (and thus speed) must be maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor at this point is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum displacement must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first isolate the square root term by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D exactly.\n\n    *   A) is incorrect.\n    *   B) is incorrect.\n    *   C) corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which can be obtained from our result in the limit $c \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\to 0$, and using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1-2x$ for small $x$, we get $v_{max}^2 \\approx c^2(1-(1-2\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})) = c^2(\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}) = \\frac{kA^2}{m}$, so $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$. This confirms our relativistic formula has the correct non-relativistic limit.\n    *   D) is the correct relativistic result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
