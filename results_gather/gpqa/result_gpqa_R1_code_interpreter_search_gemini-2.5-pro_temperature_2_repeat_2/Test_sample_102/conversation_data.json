    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the position of the acetyl group (-COCH3) as C1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at C3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other on the ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each substituent is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director. It is installed via bromination (e.g., Br2/FeBr3).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via nitration (e.g., HNO3/H2SO4).\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nThere are important rules and limitations in electrophilic aromatic substitution that must be considered:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO2 group). They also fail on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3).\n*   **Order Matters:** The order in which substituents are introduced determines the final substitution pattern, as each new substituent is directed by the groups already present on the ring.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> p-Bromonitrobenzene** (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group and also deactivated by the -Br group. The Friedel-Crafts reaction will not proceed or will give a very low yield. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.** The -NH2 group is strongly activating and an *o,p*-director.\n3.  **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the catalyst and the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   The first four steps are: Nitration -> Reduction to Amine -> Diazotization -> Deamination. This sequence (i-iv) takes benzene and converts it back to benzene, making these steps redundant and illogical.\n*   Let's look at the sequence starting from benzene for the relevant substitutions: v) Br2/FeBr3 followed by vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3.\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Bromoacetophenone** (major product) + o-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **p-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ???** Now we nitrate p-bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -Br at C4). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to C3, C5). The -Br group directs *ortho* (to C3, C5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. So, the product will be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** This is the Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acetyl group (-COCH3) is added, which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine will add to the meta position (C3). The structure is now correct for the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n    *   -Br (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, directing to C2, C4, C6.\n    In cases of conflicting directors where one is a strong *meta*-director (like -COCH3) and the other is a weaker *o,p*-director (like -Br), the position that is least deactivated will be attacked. The -COCH3 group strongly deactivates its *ortho* and *para* positions (C2, C4, C6), making C5 the most favorable site for electrophilic attack. This reaction is known to produce the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence C successfully produce the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) appear to be erroneous additions to the question, as they would modify the correct product into something else. However, among the given choices, Option C is the only one that contains a valid and high-yield pathway to the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions involves first introducing the *meta*-directing acetyl group, followed by sequential substitutions that are directed by the groups already on the ring to form the 1,3,5 pattern. Option C provides a valid synthetic route in its first three steps.\n\n<<<C>>>"
