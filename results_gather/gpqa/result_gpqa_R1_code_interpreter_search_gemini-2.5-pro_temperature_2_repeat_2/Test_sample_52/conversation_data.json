    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data to identify functional groups and structural fragments.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this core is C6H4. The presence of a ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DOU).\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O bond in the ester adds 1 DOU.\n    *   **1H NMR signals**:\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern with different substituents, or a para substitution. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group with no protons on the adjacent atom (like the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group also contains a C=C double bond, which adds 1 DOU.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One -CH3 group is accounted for by the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or have any other alkyl chain longer than a methyl group. Combined with the presence of a second -CH3 signal, this strongly points to the ester being either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In both cases, this fragment has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   Aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, both having the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from these parts to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbon atoms: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from ester) = 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the result by checking the Degrees of Unsaturation (DOU).**\n    *   The structural features identified are: 1 benzene ring (4 DOU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DOU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DOU).\n    *   Total expected DOU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's calculate the DOU from the derived formula, C11H12O2, using the formula DOU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   DOU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DOU matches the expected DOU from the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2 (DOU = 7)\n    *   B) C11H14O2 (DOU = 5)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   D) C12H14O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent. For instance, C12H14O2 has the correct DOU, but building a molecule with that formula that also matches the NMR data (no CH2, only two CH3 signals) is not possible. Adding a CH3 to C11H12O2 would necessitate removing an H, creating C12H14O2, but would result in three CH3 signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
