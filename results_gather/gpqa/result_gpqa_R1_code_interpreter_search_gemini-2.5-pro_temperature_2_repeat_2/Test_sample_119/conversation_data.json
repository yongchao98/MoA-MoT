    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Assumptions and Goal:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the star density, let's call it `ρ`) is constant everywhere.\n    *   **Goal:** Find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = (4/3)πρd³`\n\n3.  **Consider a Thin Shell of Stars:**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars at a specific distance, not the cumulative number up to that distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell `dV` can be found by differentiating the volume `V` with respect to the radius `d`:\n        `dV = d/dd((4/3)πd³) * dd = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` within this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n        This tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell of constant thickness `dd` increases with the square of the distance (`d²`).\n\n4.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   The question is about parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. For simplicity in astronomical units, the relation is:\n        `plx = 1/d`  or  `d = 1/plx`\n    *   We need to express the number of stars `dN` in terms of parallax. This means we must substitute `d` and `dd` with their equivalents in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Express the differential `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`:**\n    *   We can find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are only concerned with the magnitude (the size of the interval), so we can write:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the Equation for `dN`:**\n    *   We start with our equation for the number of stars in a shell:\n        `dN = 4πρ * d² * dd`\n    *   Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (ignoring the sign as it's a count of objects):\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can find this by dividing by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars found in a given small interval of parallax decreases very rapidly as the parallax itself gets smaller (i.e., as we look at stars farther and farther away).\n\n<<<A>>>"
