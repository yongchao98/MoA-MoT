    "Here's my thinking process to solve this titration problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, I identify the initial reactants and their properties. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and we're titrating it with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   The first step in the procedure is a dilution. The 20.00 cm³ of acid is mixed with 20.00 cm³ of water. I need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid before the titration starts.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 mol/L\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New volume after dilution:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid (the one we'll be titrating):**\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acid has been neutralized by the base. This creates a buffer solution containing the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At 25% neutralization:\n    *   75% of the original acid (CH₃COOH) remains.\n    *   25% of the acid has been converted into its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base to the weak acid is `[A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3`.\n*   This is a perfect scenario to use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, I need the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   Now, I can plug the values into the equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n*   Let's use a Python script to do the calculation accurately.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of added base (NaOH) equal the initial moles of the acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol (from Step 1)\n    *   Therefore, moles of NaOH added = 0.001 mol.\n*   At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻.\n*   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, I first need to find the pOH by calculating the concentration of OH⁻ produced.\n*   **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Volume of diluted acid = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   Volume of NaOH needed = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    *   The relationship is Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   **Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction to find [OH⁻]:**\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb will be small, I can use the approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ Kb × 0.02\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb × 0.02)\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n*   I'll use the same Python script to calculate both the 25% titration pH and the equivalence point pH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and initial values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020  # 0.001 mol\n\n# --- pH at 25% Titration ---\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Total volume at equivalence point\n# vol_NaOH = moles_acid / conc_NaOH = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L\n# vol_total = vol_diluted_acid + vol_NaOH = 0.040 L + 0.010 L = 0.050 L\nvol_total_eq = 0.050\nconc_acetate = initial_moles_acid / vol_total_eq # 0.02 M\n\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate]\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n>>>\n\nThe calculations match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

A buffer solution contains the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH.\n\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n*   The ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to weak acid [HA] is `[A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3`.\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nThe equivalence point is reached when the moles of added base (NaOH) are equal to the initial moles of the acid (0.001 mol). At this point, all the CH₃COOH has been converted to its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻. This weak base then hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ and making the solution basic.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    *   First, find the volume of NaOH needed:\n        *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base ([A⁻] or [CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for the conjugate base:**\n    *   We know Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Use an ICE table (or approximation) to find the [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let `x` = [OH⁻].
