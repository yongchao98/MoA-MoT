    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the components and reactions:**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   In water, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n    *   The H2PO4- and HPO4^2- ions form a buffer pair, corresponding to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The relevant equilibrium is:\n        H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (governed by Ka2)\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion:\n        HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (governed by Ka3)\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\n    *   First, we calculate the number of moles for each salt.\n        *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Next, we find their concentrations in the 200.00 cm3 (0.200 L) solution.\n        *   [H2PO4-] = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L\n        *   [HPO4^2-] = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**:\n    *   The [H+] in the solution is determined by the buffer equilibrium involving Ka2. We use the acid dissociation constant expression for the second dissociation:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Since both concentrations are in the same volume, the volume term cancels out, and we can use the ratio of moles:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * (moles of H2PO4- / moles of HPO4^2-)\n        [H+] = 6.2 x 10^-8 * ((1.00 / 136.09) / (1.00 / 177.99))\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]**:\n    *   The [PO4^3-] is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    *   We can now substitute the expression for [H+] from step 3 and the concentration of [HPO4^2-] from step 2 into this equation. The calculation is performed using a python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the given constants\nm_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # mass in g\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # molar mass in g/mol\nm_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # mass in g\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # molar mass in g/mol\nV_L = 0.200  # volume in L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = m_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = m_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\n# Note: Since we use ratios later, we can work with moles directly for the [H+] calculation,\n# but we'll need the concentration of HPO4^2- for the final step.\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / V_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# From Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-], [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\nconc_ratio = moles_H2PO4_minus / moles_HPO4_2minus\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * conc_ratio\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# From Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-], [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.24x10^-7 M for the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.81x10^-7 M\nB) 3.97x10^-7 M\nC) 6.24x10^-7 M\nD) 5.48x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we'll follow a few key steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:** First, we calculate the number of moles of each compound and then their molar concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4⁻) = Mass / Molar Mass\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4²⁻) = Mass / Molar Mass\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Now, we find their concentrations:\n        [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n        [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the [H⁺] of the Buffer Solution:** The two species, H2PO4⁻ (an acid) and HPO4²⁻ (its conjugate base), form a buffer. The pH and thus the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] are governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 × 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the [PO₄³⁻]:** The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka3.\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Now we plug in the values we've calculated:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 × 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
