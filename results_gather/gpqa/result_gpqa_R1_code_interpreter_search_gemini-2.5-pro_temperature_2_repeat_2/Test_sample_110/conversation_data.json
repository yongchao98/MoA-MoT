    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   This combination of reactants points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate must form by removing the proton from C6. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule connects the C6 of the original ketone to a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group.\n    *   The product is `ethyl 3-(substituted-cyclohexyl)propanoate`. We need to determine the correct IUPAC name for the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring for naming purposes. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as **C1**. This carbon was the original C6 of the ketone and has a methyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional group (the ketone's carbonyl) the lowest possible number.\n    *   Starting from the point of attachment (C1), numbering towards the carbonyl group gives the C=O group position **C2**. This was the original C1 of the ketone.\n    *   Continuing this numbering, the carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now **C3**.\n    *   So, the substituent groups on the ring are located as follows:\n        *   Methyl group at C1 (from original C6).\n        *   Oxo group (=O) at C2 (from original C1).\n        *   Ethyl group and Methyl group at C3 (from original C2).\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is therefore: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. In CH₃-CH=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the connectivity of the product:\n        The `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` group from 1-nitropropane is attached to the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n        The skeleton is: `CH₃ - CH(adds here) - CH₂ - CN`.\n        The final structure is: `CH₃ - CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃) - CH₂ - CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The main chain must include this group's carbon.\n    *   We find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n        `N≡C(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(3) - CH(4)(NO₂) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n        The main chain attached to C3 is the ethyl group from the nitroalkane, which makes a 6-carbon chain.\n    *   The parent alkane is hexane, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we identify and locate the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A **methyl group** (from the original butenenitrile) is on **C3**.\n        *   A **nitro group** (from the original 1-nitropropane) is on **C4**.\n    *   Combining these parts, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n\nThus, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
