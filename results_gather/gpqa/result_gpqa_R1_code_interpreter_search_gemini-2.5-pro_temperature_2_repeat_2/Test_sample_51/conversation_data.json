    "The user wants to find the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes when a star has spots versus when it does not.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The distribution of atoms among different energy levels in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  **Formulate the equations:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (2 and 1) as:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g₂, g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the two scenarios:**\n    *   **No spots:** The temperature is T_nospot = 6000 K.\n        (N₂ / N₁)_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))\n    *   **With spots:** The temperature is T_spot = 5500 K.\n        (N₂ / N₁)_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\n4.  **Determine the required factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the two ratios calculated above:\n    Factor = (N₂ / N₁)_nospot / (N₂ / N₁)_spot\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression for the factor:**\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n    The term with the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp( -ΔE / (k * T_nospot) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) )\n    Factor = exp( ΔE / (k * T_spot) - ΔE / (k * T_nospot) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n\n6.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The problem provides the wavelength (λ) of the photon corresponding to the transition between the two energy levels, λ = 1448 Å. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels.\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is Planck's constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m.\n\n7.  **Substitute ΔE into the factor equation:**\n    Factor = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n\n8.  **Perform the calculation:** Now, we plug in the values for the constants and the given temperatures. This is best done using a script to maintain precision. The extraneous information such as stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not needed for this calculation, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are already provided.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given data\nT_nospot = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spot = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in K\nwavelength_A = 1448.0 # Wavelength in Angstroms\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate the energy difference between the levels\ndelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the term in the exponent of the Boltzmann factor ratio\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1 / T_spot - 1 / T_nospot)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>4.5\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.5. This means the ratio of populations N₂/N₁ is 4.5 times higher in the hotter photosphere (no spots) than in the cooler photosphere (with spots).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Law:** The problem asks for the ratio of the population of atoms in two different energy levels. In a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this ratio is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in energy level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of these levels (a property of the atom itself).\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Define the Two Scenarios:** We have two different temperatures for the star's photosphere:\n    *   **No spots:** T_nospot = 6000 K\n    *   **With spots:** T_spot = 5500 K\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratios for Each Scenario:**\n    *   Let R_nospot be the ratio (N₂ / N₁) when there are no spots:\n        R_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))\n\n    *   Let R_spot be the ratio (N₂ / N₁) when there are spots:\n        R_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\n4.  **Determine the Factor of Change:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n\n    Factor = R_nospot / R_spot\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancel out. Using the exponent rule exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), we get:\n\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_nospot) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ ΔE / (k * T_spot) - ΔE / (k * T_nospot) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) ]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å. We can calculate this using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n\n    *   h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\n7.  **Combine and Calculate:** Now, we substitute the expression for ΔE into our factor equation and plug in all the known values. This is where a quick calculation is helpful.\n\n    Factor = exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) ]\n    Factor = exp[ ( (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23) ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\n    A python script was used to perform this calculation accurately:\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Physical constants\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\n    c = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\n    k = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n    # Given data\n    T_nospot = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\n    T_spot = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in K\n    wavelength_A = 1448.0 # Wavelength in Angstroms\n    wavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10 # Wavelength in meters\n\n    # Calculate the energy difference between the levels\n    delta_E = (h * c) / wavelength_m\n\n    # Calculate the term in the exponent of the Boltzmann factor ratio\n    exponent = (delta_E / k) * (1 / T_spot - 1 / T_nospot)\n\n    # Calculate the final factor\n    factor = np.exp(exponent)\n\n    print(f\"{factor:.1f}\")\n    ```\n    The output of this code is **4.5**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the higher energy level to the lower energy level is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star has no spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it is 40% covered by spots (T=5500 K). This makes sense, as a higher temperature will excite more atoms to higher energy states.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
