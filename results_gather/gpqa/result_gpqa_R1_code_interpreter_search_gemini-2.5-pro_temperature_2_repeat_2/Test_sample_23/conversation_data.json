    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, containing only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let the formula be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂): H% = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n=1, 4/16=25%. For large n, H% approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ): H% = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n        *   Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂): H% will be lower.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Relate all compounds via the carbon skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (compounds A and B) and mixture Y (compounds C and D) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all four compounds A, B, C, and D, as well as Z itself, share the same carbon skeleton. When they are fully saturated with hydrogen, they all become Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over a heated platinum catalyst. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum (a reaction known as Zelinzky irreversible catalysis) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated to form a stable aromatic system.\n    *   Substance Z is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ) and is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since C is the hydrogenated product, its partner D must be the dehydrogenated product. The final, most stable dehydrogenated product of a cycloalkane skeleton is the corresponding aromatic compound.\n    *   Mixture Y = {a cycloalkane (Z), an aromatic compound}.\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most common case, a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   Z would be **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent with formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n        *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (Z) and benzene**.\n        *   Let's check: Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Both are liquids. Neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits the description of Y perfectly. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, so hydrogenation of this mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This also fits.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorizes bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D` must be balanced. With Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)}, the total formula of the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the reactants A+B must also have the total formula C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   A and B must have the same C₆ ring skeleton. We are looking for two different unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated ring compounds (non-conjugated):\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: one double bond.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: two isolated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check the sum of their hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches exactly.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n        In this hydrogen transfer, the diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the monoene gains those 2H to become cyclohexane. This reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y.\n\n5.  **Verify all conditions**\n    *   X = {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}. Equimolar mixture of two liquids. Both have C=C bonds, so they decolorize Br₂ water. 1,4-CHD has no conjugated bonds. ✓\n    *   Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Equimolar mixture formed from X. Both are liquids that do not decolorize Br₂ water. ✓\n    *   Z = C₆H₁₂. Has H% of 14.3%, is a constituent of Y, is a widely used solvent, is saturated. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of X ({C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y ({C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   All conditions are satisfied by this C₆-based system. An analogous C₇-based system {methylcyclohexene, methylcyclohexadiene} is also possible and would lead to an answer of 22, but the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
