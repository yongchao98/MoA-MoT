    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **5**\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is conjugated with a benzene ring. This could be a conjugated ester or ketone. Given the molecular formula contains two oxygen atoms, an **ester (-COO-)** is very likely. An ester C=O conjugated to an aromatic ring typically appears around 1730-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group, following the n+1 rule where 2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃- group, where 3+1=4).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are coupled and indicate the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet each):** This distinct pattern of two doublets is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different (one electron-donating, one electron-withdrawing), creating this symmetrical pattern.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nPlacing these fragments together, the amine group and the ester group must be the two substituents on the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n*   **-COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester):** The -CH₃ gives the triplet at 1.20 ppm, and the -O-CH₂- gives the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This fits.\n*   **-NH₂ (amine):** The two amine protons give the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. This fits.\n*   **Para-substituted ring:** The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, and the amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded (appear upfield), corresponding to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (appear downfield), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This arrangement fits the data perfectly.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide, not an ester, and is meta-substituted. Incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our derived structure and all spectral data. Correct.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester. It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO). Incorrect.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester of phenol (-O-CO-R), not a benzoic acid ester (-CO-O-R). The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet for this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
