    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must come from an oxidizing gas in the mixture. Two main scenarios are possible:\n        *   **Scenario A:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n        *   **Scenario B:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 mol of N₂O gas. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of gas C at standard temperature and pressure (STP) remained.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nLet's evaluate both scenarios to see if they are consistent.\n\n*   **Scenario A:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly.\n\n*   **Scenario B:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O. The 0.1 mol of remaining gas is N₂. However, the reduction of N₂O also produces N₂. The total N₂ (0.1 mol) is the sum of the N₂ initially present and the N₂ produced from N₂O.\n    *   n(N₂ from N₂O) = n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    *   n(N₂ initial) = Total n(N₂) - n(N₂ from N₂O) = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the decomposition products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × n(N₂O)) + (2 × n(N₂)) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (1 × n(N₂O)) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   This yields the exact same elemental composition as Scenario A, which also sums to 7.20 g.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the data and lead to the same conclusion: the 7.20 g mixture contains **0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O, and decompose fully into gases. This strongly points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A common high-temperature decomposition of ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume we have *n* moles of each salt.\nIf A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃:\n*   *n* NH₄NO₂ produces *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   *n* NH₄NO₃ produces *n* mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + 2*n* mol H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio).\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow we match this with our findings from Scenario A: n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(O₂) = 0.025 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol.\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.025  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Check N₂: Total N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches)\n*   Check H₂O: Total H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (Matches)\n\nThe identification is correct. We have an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms in the salts.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
