    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, for time-dependent charge and current distributions `ρ(r', t')` and `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas. These formulas account for the finite speed of light, `c`. The potential at a field point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the source at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n\nThe general expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n\nwhere `dτ'` is the volume element of the source, and the retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation:\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\nThis equation means that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, emitted from the source point `r'` at time `tr` arrives at the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas for the potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr` inside the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The standard derivation (which involves a change of variables and properties of the delta function) yields the following results, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere:\n*   All quantities in the brackets (`d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n### 4. Algebraic Manipulation to Match the Options\n\nLet's re-write the expressions to match the format of the given options. The key is the denominator term:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d)\\cdot\\vec{v}/c) = d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`.\n\nFor the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c}$\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential `A`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/c}$\n\nAgain, multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Given Options\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's check the provided options:\n*   **A)** Has a `+` sign in the denominator. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** Uses the static potential formula and the distance from the origin `r` instead of the retarded distance `d`. Incorrect.\n*   **C)** Same as B, and the relationship between A and V is incorrect. Incorrect.\n*   **D)** Matches our derived expressions for both `V` and `A` perfectly.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
