    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deciphering the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` represents a cyclohexane ring fused to a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` part means the atom in the 1-carbon bridge (C7) is an oxygen atom, making the three-membered ring an epoxide (oxirane). The fusion carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to determine the relative stereochemistry of all groups on the cyclohexane ring. Let's use a 2D planar representation with wedges (up, β) and dashes (down, α). Bicycloalkanes are cis-fused by convention unless specified otherwise. We'll assume the epoxide oxygen is 'up' (wedge) and check if this is consistent with the given R/S assignments.\n\nLet's assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities for each stereocenter:\n*   **At C1:** Groups are -O(7), -C6, -C2, -CH3. Priority order is O > C6 > C2 > CH3. For a (1R) configuration, if we assume the lowest priority group (-CH3) is pointing away (dash), the sequence O→C6→C2 must be clockwise. In a standard ring drawing, this sequence is counter-clockwise. Thus, for (1R), the methyl group must be pointing up (wedge), cis to the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **At C6:** Groups are -O(7), -C1, -C5, -H. Priority order is O > C1 > C5 > H. For a (6S) configuration, if we assume the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away (dash), the sequence O→C1→C5 must be counter-clockwise. This matches the drawing. So, the H atom at C6 is 'down' (dash).\n*   **At C3:** Groups are -C2, -C4, -CH3, -H. Priority order is C2 > C4 > CH3 > H. For a (3R) configuration, if H is 'down' (dash), the sequence C2→C4→CH3 must be clockwise. This is consistent. So, the methyl group at C3 is 'up' (wedge).\n*   **At C4:** Groups are -C5, -C3, -CH3, -H. Priority order is C5 > C3 > CH3 > H. For a (4R) configuration, if H is 'down' (dash), the sequence C5→C3→CH3 must be clockwise. In our drawing, this sequence is counter-clockwise. So, for (4R), the H must be 'up' (wedge), meaning the methyl group at C4 is 'down' (dash).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide Oxygen: **Up** (wedge, β)\n*   C1-Methyl: **Up** (wedge, β)\n*   C3-Methyl: **Up** (wedge, β)\n*   C4-Methyl: **Down** (dash, α)\n*   The H on C6 is **Down** (dash, α).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Reaction\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) is a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Rules (provided in the question):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide. The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6. C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to -Me, -C2, -C6, -O), while C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to -H, -C1, -C5, -O). C6 is sterically less hindered. Therefore, the **methyl nucleophile will attack C6**.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** **Inversion of configuration** occurs at the site of nucleophilic attack (SN2 mechanism). Since the epoxide oxygen is 'up', the nucleophile must attack from the 'down' face. This leads to inversion of the stereocenter at C6.\n\n### 3. Predicting the Product\n1.  **Attack:** The Me⁻ attacks C6 from the 'down' (α) face.\n2.  **Bond Changes:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, and the oxygen is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A new C6-Me bond is formed.\n3.  **Stereochemical Consequences:**\n    *   The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected. They remain (1R), (3R), and (4R), respectively.\n    *   The configuration at C6 inverts from (6S) to (6R).\n\n### 4. Naming the Product\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexanol. We need to determine its proper IUPAC name to match the options.\n\n*   **Substituents on the ring (using original numbering):**\n    *   At C1: an -OH group and a -CH₃ group.\n    *   At C3: a -CH₃ group.\n    *   At C4: a -CH₃ group.\n    *   At C6: a new -CH₃ group.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is C1. So, `new C1` = `old C1`. We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (the four methyl groups).\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** `old C1` → `old C6` → `old C5` → ... The methyl groups are at `new C1` (`old C1`), `new C2` (`old C6`), `new C4` (`old C4`), and `new C5` (`old C3`). The locant set is **{1, 2, 4, 5}**.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** `old C1` → `old C2` → `old C3` → ... The methyl groups are at `new C1` (`old C1`), `new C3` (`old C3`), `new C4` (`old C4`), and `new C6` (`old C6`). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Comparing the sets, {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}. So, the clockwise numbering is correct.\n*   **Product Name:** The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n### 5. Determining the Final Stereochemistry\nWe need to find the configuration of the stereocenters based on the new numbering system:\n\n*   **`new C1`**: This is the same as `old C1`. Its configuration remains **R**.\n*   **`new C2`**: This is `old C6`. Its configuration inverted from S to **R**.\n*   **`new C4`**: This is the same as `old C4`. Its configuration remains **R**.\n*   **`new C5`**: This is `old C3`. Its configuration remains **R**.\n\nTherefore, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
