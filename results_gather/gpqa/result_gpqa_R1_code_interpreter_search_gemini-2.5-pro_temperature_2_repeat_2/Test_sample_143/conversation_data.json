The formula is:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n    *   **Time Dilation:** In the laboratory frame, the particle is moving at a high speed. Its lifetime appears longer due to relativistic time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is given by:\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n        where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$).\n        $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    *   **Relativistic Quantities:**\n        *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \\frac{E}{m c^2}$, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass.\n        *   The momentum $p$ is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n        *   The term $v \\gamma$ can be conveniently expressed using momentum: $p = \\gamma m v$, so $v\\gamma = \\frac{p}{m}$.\n        *   Substituting this into the decay distance formula:\n            $L = \\frac{p}{m} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma c} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n            This formula is very convenient as it uses quantities ($pc$, $mc^2$, $\\Gamma$) typically given in energy units (GeV or MeV) and the constant $\\hbar c$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Unify Units.**\n        It's best to work with a consistent set of units.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the mean decay distance ($L$) of a meson resonance X as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   Total energy of the particle in the lab frame: $E_{X}=8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle: $m_{X}=1.2 \\, \\text{GeV/c}^2$\n*   Decay width of the particle: $\\Gamma_{X}=320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**3. Recall Relevant Physical Principles**\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the lab frame is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$).\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n\n*   **Mean Lifetime (Rest Frame):** The particle's mean lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau_0$) is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to special relativity, the lifetime of the moving particle appears longer in the lab frame. This effect is described by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 = \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$, where $E$ is the total energy and $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n\n*   **Decay Distance Formula:** Combining these, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    For convenience in calculations involving relativistic particles (where energies are often given in units like GeV or MeV), we can express this formula differently. We know the relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v$. This can be rewritten as $v \\gamma = p/m$.\n    Substituting this into the equation for L gives:\n    $L = \\frac{p}{m} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    To work entirely with energy units and universal constants, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $c^2$:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    This is the most practical formula, as $pc$ (momentum times speed of light), $mc^2$ (rest energy), and $\\Gamma$ (decay width) are usually given in energy units (e.g., GeV), and $\\hbar c$ is a well-known physical constant.\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Unify Units**\n    Ensure all values are in a consistent unit, for example, GeV.\n    $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    $mc^2 = m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$ (using natural units where c=1)\n    $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**\n    Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = (8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\, (\\text{GeV})^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{62.56} \\approx 7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$)**\n    Now substitute the values into the formula $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    We will use the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV·fm}$ or $0.197327 \\, \\text{GeV·fm}$, where 1 fm (femtometer) = $10^{-15}$ m.\n\n    $L = \\frac{7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\times \\frac{0.197327 \\, \\text{GeV·fm}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}}$\n    $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166) \\, \\text{fm}$\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\n*   **Step D: Convert to meters**\n    Since 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m:\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. This value is extremely close to option B.\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe slight difference between our calculated value and the option is likely due to using a more precise value for $\\hbar c$. The code execution output was $4.0644675346618406 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, which strongly confirms this result.\n\nThe final answer is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
