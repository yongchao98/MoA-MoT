    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone and Bromine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a halogen.\n*   **Mechanism:** Cyclohexanone exists in equilibrium with its enol form. The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks a bromine molecule (Br₂), adding a bromine atom to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, the two alpha-carbons are equivalent, so only one product is formed.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone and Sodium Hydroxide (a strong base).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Favorskii Rearrangement. This is a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a base, especially when there is a hydrogen atom on the other alpha-carbon (the α'-position).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sɴ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This creates a strained bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    4.  The ring system rearranges and opens to relieve strain. The bond between C1 and C6 breaks, which is favored because it forms a more stable primary carbanion at C6 (compared to a secondary carbanion if the C1-C2 bond were to break).\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (typically during acidic workup, which is implied) yields a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, Thionyl chloride, and Pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n*   **Mechanism:** Thionyl chloride is the standard reagent for this transformation. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Partial reduction of an acid chloride to an aldehyde.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiAlH(OtBu)₃ is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is highly selective for reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final product is Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n      ```\n            CHO\n             |\n            C1-H\n           /   \\\n      H2C2-----C5H2\n         |     |\n      H2C3-----C4H2\n      ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, and the hydrogen atom attached to C1. It bisects the bond between C3 and C4.\n\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens based on this symmetry:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The proton of the -CHO group lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The proton on the carbon atom to which the aldehyde is attached also lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 chemically equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are **diastereotopic**. This is because C1 is a prochiral center, and replacing each hydrogen with another group would create diastereomers. Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct hydrogen types. The same applies to C5, which are equivalent to their C2 counterparts. So, from the C2 and C5 positions combined, we get two distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 chemically equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives two more distinct hydrogen types, which are different from those at the C2/C5 positions. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1 H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 Hs: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 Hs: 2 types\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
