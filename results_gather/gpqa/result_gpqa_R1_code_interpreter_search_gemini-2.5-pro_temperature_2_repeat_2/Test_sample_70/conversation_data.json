    "The user wants me to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Identify Key Information:**\n*   There are five planets in the system.\n*   The orbits are circular.\n*   The orbital period ratios are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   All planets have the same albedo (A).\n*   The goal is to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis (the distance from the star for a circular orbit). This simplified formula works because the star's luminosity, the star's radius, and the planet's albedo are constant for the two planets being compared.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (P) with its semi-major axis (a). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    P² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Formulate the Derivation:**\n\n*   We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n*   From the equilibrium temperature formula:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(1/a4)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\n*   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law to replace the semi-major axes (a) with the orbital periods (P), which are given.\n    a2 ∝ P2^(2/3)\n    a4 ∝ P4^(2/3)\n    So, a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n*   Substitute this back into our temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n\n*   Simplify the exponents:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2)) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\n\n*   From the given ratios, we have:\n    P2 = 2 (in some unit of time)\n    P4 = 3.5 (in the same unit of time)\n*   So, P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\n*   Substitute this into our final equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nI will now use Python to calculate this value precisely.\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is derived to be (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# We are given the ratio of periods P2:P4 as 2:3.5.\n\np2_ratio = 2.0\np4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = (p2_ratio / p4_ratio)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.82998. This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 0.83. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated away. For a planet with a given albedo (A) in a circular orbit around a star with luminosity L, the formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the star's luminosity.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\n2.  **Simplifying for a Ratio:** When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) in the same system, the constants ($L$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out. We are also told that the planets have the same albedo ($A_4 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)$ term also cancels out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L(1 - A_4)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4}}{\\left( \\frac{L(1 - A_2)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a_2^2} \\right)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2^2}{a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii.\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). The law states:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2^{2/3}}{P_4^{2/3}} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    By multiplying the exponents ($\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$), we get the final simplified relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We are given the ratio of the orbital periods: $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, we can take the relative period values for Planet_2 ($P_2 = 2$) and Planet_4 ($P_4 = 3.5$).\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    The code calculated this value to be approximately 0.8298.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is ~$0.83$. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) ~0.69\n    *   B) ~0.57\n    *   C) ~0.83\n    *   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
