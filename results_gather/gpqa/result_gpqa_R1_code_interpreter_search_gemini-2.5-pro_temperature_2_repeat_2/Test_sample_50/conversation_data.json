    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`. A conductor allows charges to move freely.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a vast reservoir of charge (the Earth). This forces the sphere to be at a constant potential, which we define as V = 0.\n    *   The point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`).\n    *   The presence of `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the conducting sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on its surface.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    *   This problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" The complex distribution of induced charge on the sphere's surface can be replaced by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere.\n    *   The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary conditions of the original problem. The key boundary condition is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r = R`) is zero.\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n        *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   **Position:** It is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located *inside* the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential energy is zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   As the charge `q` is brought closer, it experiences an attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the energy stored in the electric field created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere.\n    *   There is a standard formula for the potential energy of a charge `q` interacting with an induced charge distribution on a conductor: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created *only* by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   Using the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   Now, calculate `V_induced` at the position of `q`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)` (where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`)\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n        The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, use the potential energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The derived potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   This expression is negative, which makes physical sense. The force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, so the potential energy decreases as the charge is brought closer from infinity (where `U=0`).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
