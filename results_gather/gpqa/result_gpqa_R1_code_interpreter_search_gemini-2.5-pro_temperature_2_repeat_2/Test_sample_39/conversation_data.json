    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. A key part of synthetic organic chemistry is not just making a new compound, but also purifying it from the starting materials, byproducts, and solvents. The most common method for monitoring reactions and purifying products in this field is chromatography (e.g., Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography).\n\n*   **Interpretation of the phrase \"on top of each other\":**\n    *   In the context of Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), compounds are separated on a plate and appear as \"spots.\" If two compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means their spots have not separated and appear at the same position on the TLC plate.\n    *   In the context of column chromatography, compounds are separated as they pass through a column packed with a stationary phase. If two compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means they elute from the column at the same time and are collected in the same fractions, failing to separate.\n    *   Both of these scenarios describe a failed chromatographic separation.\n\n*   **Connecting to chemical principles:** Chromatographic separation is primarily based on the differential partitioning of compounds between a stationary phase (like silica gel or alumina) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This partitioning is governed by the relative polarity of the compounds.\n    *   Compounds with similar polarities will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in a very similar way.\n    *   This leads to them traveling through the chromatography system (the TLC plate or the column) at nearly the same rate.\n    *   The result is poor separation, which a chemist would describe as the compounds being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is not directly related to the common separation techniques that would evoke this imagery.\n    *   B) Non-covalent interactions are the *reason* for properties like polarity, but the statement describes the *observational result* of a failed separation, which is caused by a specific property (polarity) being too similar.\n    *   **C) The compounds having similar polarities is the direct cause of them failing to separate during chromatography, the most common purification technique in this field. This perfectly explains why they would be \"on top of each other.\"**\n    *   D) Similar boiling points would lead to a difficult separation by distillation. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more common jargon for chromatographic separation (spots on a plate, bands in a column) than for co-distilling liquids. Chromatography is a more universally applied purification method in modern synthetic labs than distillation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism in an organic chemistry lab for a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
