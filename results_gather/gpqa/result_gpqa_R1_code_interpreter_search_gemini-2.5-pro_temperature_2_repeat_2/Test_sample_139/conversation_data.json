    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues about the Reaction:**\n    *   **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope:** This is a key starting point. Common examples are Deuterium (D or ²H) replacing Protium (H or ¹H).\n    *   **Reacts violently with liquid Y:** This suggests a very energetic, exothermic reaction, typical of alkali metals or powerful hydrides with water/protic solvents.\n    *   **Release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons:** Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 1 proton, 0 neutrons per atom -> molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 1 proton, 1 neutron per atom -> molecule has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate and aligns with the first clue.\n    *   **A precipitate G forms:** An insoluble solid is a product of the reaction.\n    *   **G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K:** 277 Kelvin is about 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an almost perfect match. So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   This implies that G is a compound that contains D₂O (like a deuterated hydrate) or decomposes to produce D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)x` decomposing upon heating: `2M(OD)x → M₂Ox + x D₂O`. This fits perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances X and Y:**\n    *   From the above, we have a reaction that produces D₂ gas and involves D₂O. The simplest reaction that fits this is a metal deuteride (from X) reacting with heavy water (Y).\n    *   Let's propose: X = a deuteride reagent, and Y = D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: `Deuteride + D₂O → Deuteroxide + D₂`.\n    *   For this to be violent and form a precipitate, we need a reactive metal.\n\n3.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from 3 to 2 is a reduction. Specifically, the reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols (`R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`) would result in a diol with 2 oxygens.\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to common reducing agents. The most common powerful reducing agents are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   The problem specifies X contains a heavier isotope, so we should consider their deuterated analogs: **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)** or **Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Identity of X:**\n    *   Let's test if **X = LiAlD₄** fits all clues.\n    *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent. Check.\n    *   Let Y be D₂O. The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n        *   *Violent reaction?* Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. Check.\n        *   *Gas W (p=n)?* Yes, it produces D₂. Check.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide `Al(OD)₃` is a gelatinous precipitate. Check.\n        *   *Heating G releases B (D₂O)?* Yes, `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. Check.\n    *   Let's test **X = NaBD₄**.\n        *   Its analog, NaBH₄, is also a common reagent, but LiAlH₄ is stronger and its reaction with water is far more violent, fitting the clue \"reacts violently\" better.\n        *   The reaction `NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4 D₂` would produce soluble products (`NaOD` and `B(OD)₃`), not a distinct precipitate, which makes it a poorer fit for G.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are:\n        *   **Li** (Lithium), Atomic Number Z=3\n        *   **Al** (Aluminum), Atomic Number Z=13\n        *   **H** (Hydrogen, present as the isotope D), Atomic Number Z=1\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" implies we need to sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula unit.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved: D is ²H (mass ≈ 2), and the single stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al (mass ≈ 27).\n\n```python\n# Atomic mass of the heaviest element in LiAlD4, which is Aluminum (Al-27)\n# There is 1 atom of Aluminum in the formula.\nmass_heaviest_element_total = 1 * 27\n\n# Atomic mass of the lightest element in LiAlD4, which is Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D or H-2)\n# There are 4 atoms of Deuterium in the formula.\nmass_lightest_element_total = 4 * 2\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested\ncumulative_mass = mass_heaviest_element_total + mass_lightest_element_total\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<\n35\n>>>",
    "*   **Identify Gas W and Substance B:**\n    1.  The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze common diatomic gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, a heavier isotope of hydrogen): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit.\n    2.  This suggests that Substance X contains deuterium (D).\n    3.  Substance B has a melting point of approximately 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    1.  Substance G releases D₂O (B) when heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydroxide (like M(OD)x) or a deuterated hydrate.\n    2.  Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas D₂ and a precipitate G. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Given the presence of deuterium everywhere, it is logical to assume the reaction is between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    3.  Reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G, precipitate) + D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    4.  So, **Y is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue to Identify X:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol (`-COOH` -> `-CH₂OH`).\n        *   Therefore, X must be a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The most common reagents for this are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), with LiAlH₄ being much stronger and necessary for reducing carboxylic acids.\n    3.  The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (Deuterium), **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verify the Reaction with LiAlD₄:**\n    1.  Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    2.  This reaction is known to be violent.\n    3.  It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    4.  It produces a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    5.  When G is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    6.  All clues fit perfectly.\n\n*   **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    1.  Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    2.  The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    3.  The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    4.  The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    5.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass is 27 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). Each has a mass of approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    6.  Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
