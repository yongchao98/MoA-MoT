    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial state: An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Final state: The nucleus splits into two fragments (fragment 1 and fragment 2).\n    *   Mass relationship: Let `m1` be the mass of the more massive fragment and `m2` be the mass of the less massive one. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Conservation of energy: Total energy is conserved.\n    *   Conservation of momentum: Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n    *   Objective: Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics and classical mechanics.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments:**\n    We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n    Substitute (1) into (2):\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n    Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    We can express the rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy (`M * c^2 = 300 GeV`):\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `E_m1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `E_m2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    From the conservation of energy, the initial total energy equals the final total energy.\n    `E_initial = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    The total kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics:**\n    In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    So, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    This means `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n    Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    Now, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n    The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), rest-mass energy (`m*c^2`), and momentum (`p`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    Substituting `E` into the equation gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    Expanding this gives `T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    This simplifies to the useful relation: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    Therefore:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2*c^2)`\n    Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    This is the correct (relativistic) value, `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    The difference is `ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical`.\n    `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Result to MeV:**\n    Since the options are in MeV, we convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nFinal check of all steps shows the logic and calculations are sound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
