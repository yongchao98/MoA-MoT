    "The user wants me to identify the immunological process described in the scenario.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the scenario:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage, targeting the gastrointestinal system.\n    *   **Site of Action:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cell Population:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. This indicates an active immune response, specifically the clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the scenario:**\n\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial, vast repertoire of B cell receptors (antibodies) and T cell receptors. It occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during their development, *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening *after* antigen exposure in a *secondary* lymphoid organ. While the initial cells had undergone VDJ recombination, the \"high variability\" in an actively proliferating, antigen-specific population is not due to VDJ recombination itself, but a subsequent process.\n\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen binding specificity. The question explicitly states the variability is in the \"variable heavy chain gene\". Therefore, this is not the primary process described, although it is likely occurring concurrently within the germinal center reaction.\n\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that is part of the innate immune response and can be activated by antibodies (the classical pathway). It involves protein cascades, not genetic modification of lymphocyte genes. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen encounter. SHM introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the variable regions (the V, D, and J segments) of the immunoglobulin genes. This creates variants of the original antibody, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. These high-affinity B cells are then selectively expanded (a process called affinity maturation). The description of a proliferating cell population in a Peyer's patch with high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene is the classic signature of ongoing somatic hypermutation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The process described — generation of high variability in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes in proliferating B cells within a secondary lymphoid organ in response to an antigen — is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
