    "An N-sided polygon where N is infinitely large is a circle. The apothem 'a' of this polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The minima (dark rings) occur at angles `theta` that satisfy the following equation:\n\n`sin(theta) = z_{1,m} * lambda / (2 * pi * a)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `theta` is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   `lambda` is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `z_{1,m}` is the m-th non-zero root (or zero) of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(theta) ≈ theta`.

    "The reasoning process has been established in the previous turns, and the provided code output confirms the numerical calculation. Here is a summary of the logical steps leading to the answer:\n\n1.  **Problem Interpretation**: The problem describes the far-field diffraction (Fraunhofer diffraction) of monochromatic light by an aperture. The aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', where N approaches infinity. An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Relevant Physics**: The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. It consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) and a series of concentric bright and dark rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\n3.  **Formula for Minima**: For small angles, the angular position `theta_m` of the m-th minimum is given by:\n    `theta_m = (z_{1,m} * lambda) / (2 * pi * a)`\n    where:\n    *   `lambda` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `z_{1,m}` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\n4.  **Required Values**: To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J_1(x)`:\n    *   First root (`m=1`): `z_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second root (`m=2`): `z_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156`\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum is `theta_1 = (z_{1,1} / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)`.\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum is `theta_2 = (z_{1,2} / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)`.\n    *   The angular distance between them is `Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1`.\n    *   `Delta_theta = ((z_{1,2} - z_{1,1}) / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)`\n\n6.  **Numerical Evaluation**: Plugging in the values for the Bessel roots:\n    `Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * pi) = 3.1839 / (2 * pi)`\n    The Python code was executed to calculate this coefficient, and the output provided was `0.5067334233102856`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    `Delta_theta ≈ 0.5067 * (lambda / a)`\n    This result is then compared with the given multiple-choice options:\n    A) 0.506 `lambda / a`\n    B) 0.610 `lambda / a`\n    C) 0.500 `lambda / a`\n    D) 1.220 `lambda /a`\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (lambda / a)` most closely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
