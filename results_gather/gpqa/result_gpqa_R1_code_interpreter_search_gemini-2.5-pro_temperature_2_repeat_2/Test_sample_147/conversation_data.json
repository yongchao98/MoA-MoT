    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the data for substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YFm. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    `ɷF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))`\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    `0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)`\n    `0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00m) = 19.00m`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724m = 19.00m`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276m`\n    `M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m`\n\n    Now, we need to find an element Y and an integer `m` (a plausible oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for `m`:\n    *   m = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to K, Ca, Sc). None of these fit the later chemical descriptions (e.g., forming 5 fluorides, oxidizing xenon).\n    *   m = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, Se, Kr). These were considered and ruled out based on other properties described in the problem.\n    *   m = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This molar mass is very close to that of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   m = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Tb, Dy). These are lanthanides, less likely to fit the overall description.\n    *   m = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi). Bismuth was checked and ruled out.\n\n2.  **Confirm Y is Antimony (Sb).**\n    Let's assume Y is Sb and `m=3`. This means A2 is antimony trifluoride (SbF3). Let's calculate the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3 to verify our assumption.\n    *   M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   M(F) = 18.998 g/mol (using a more precise value)\n    *   M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    *   ɷF = (3 * 18.998 / 178.754) * 100% = 31.88%\n    This calculated value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem statement. Thus, we can confidently identify **Y as Sb** and **A2 as SbF3**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4.**\n    The problem states that A4 is another binary compound of fluorine with element Y (Sb). The most common and stable binary fluorides of antimony are antimony trifluoride (SbF3) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Therefore, A4 is likely one of these two compounds.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4.**\n    *   **If A4 = SbF3**: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **If A4 = SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given ranges.**\n    The question asks to identify the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n    Comparing our calculated values:\n    *   M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol, which falls squarely within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A, but outside of it.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 is a perfect match for one of the answer choices. This provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**. The other chemical details in the problem (the color of A1, the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5) appear to be either contradictory, erroneous, or require knowledge of very obscure chemistry. However, they are not needed to solve the central question, which relies on the numerical data provided for A2 and the molar mass ranges given in the options. Based on the molar mass calculation, A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
