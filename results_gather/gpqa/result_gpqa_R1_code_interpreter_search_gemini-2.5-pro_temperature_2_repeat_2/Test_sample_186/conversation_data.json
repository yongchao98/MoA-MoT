    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO\n\nThe first step is to figure out the faintest star ESPRESSO can detect under the specified conditions. A star is \"detectable\" if a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) of 10 is achieved in a 1-hour (3600-second) exposure using a single 8m VLT.\n\nTo find this, we refer to the performance documented in the ESPRESSO User Manual or use an Exposure Time Calculator (ETC). Publicly available data from the ESPRESSO User Manual (Table 10 in v104.2) for the high-resolution mode (HR21) shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one VLT Unit Telescope (UT) under typical seeing conditions (0.8\"), the performance is approximately:\n*   V = 16 mag -> S/N ≈ 11 (at 550 nm)\n*   V = 14 mag -> S/N ≈ 42 (at 550 nm)\n\nWe need the magnitude that corresponds to an S/N of 10. The S/N is proportional to the light flux from the star. The relationship between magnitude (m) and flux (F) is logarithmic: `F ∝ 10^(-0.4 * m)`.\n\nWe can interpolate using the V=16, S/N=11 data point.\nLet (V₁, S/N₁) = (16, 11) and (V₂, S/N₂) = (?, 10).\nThe ratio of fluxes is equal to the ratio of S/N ratios:\n`S/N₂ / S/N₁ = 10^(-0.4 * (V₂ - V₁))`\n`10 / 11 = 10^(-0.4 * (V₂ - 16))`\n\nTo solve for V₂, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n`log₁₀(10 / 11) = -0.4 * (V₂ - 16)`\n`-0.0414 = -0.4 * (V₂ - 16)`\n`0.1035 = V₂ - 16`\n`V₂ = 16.1035`\n\nSo, the limiting apparent magnitude for our detection criterion is approximately **V ≈ 16.1 mag**. Any star with V ≤ 16.1 will be detectable.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate each star's visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere, at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. This means some northern stars are never visible. A star is considered observable if it rises to a sufficient altitude above the horizon (e.g., > 30°, which corresponds to an airmass of < 2). The maximum altitude (h_max) of a star with declination (DEC) is `h_max = 90° - |Latitude - DEC|`.\n\nFor a star to be observable from Paranal (lat = -24.6°):\n`90° - |-24.6° - DEC| > 30°`\n`60° > |-24.6° - DEC|`\nThis gives a declination range of approximately **-84.6° < DEC < +35.4°**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each star individually\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Data:** Canopus has an apparent magnitude V = -0.74 and a declination DEC = -52.7°.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of -52.7° is well within the observable range from Paranal. It is a prominent southern star.\n*   **Detectability:** Its magnitude V = -0.74 is much brighter than the limit of 16.1.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Data:** Polaris (the North Star) has V = +1.98 and DEC = +89.3°.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of +89.3° is far outside the observable range (DEC < +35.4°). It never rises above the horizon at Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Data:** DEC = 0°, Absolute Magnitude M_V = 15, distance d = 10 pc.\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0° is on the celestial equator and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** We must first calculate its apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d_pc) - 5`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5`\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.0`\n    Since V = 15.0 is less than the 16.1 limit, it is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Data:** DEC = 0°, M_V = 15, d = 200 pc.\n*   **Visibility:** Observable (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Detectability:** Calculate m_V:\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5`\n    `m_V = 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.51`\n    Since V = 21.51 is much fainter than the 16.1 limit, it is not detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Data:** DEC = 0°, M_V = 15, d = 5 pc.\n*   **Visibility:** Observable (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Detectability:** Calculate m_V:\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5`\n    `m_V = 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.50`\n    Since V = 13.50 is less than the 16.1 limit, it is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Data:** DEC = 0°, M_V = 15, d = 50 pc.\n*   **Visibility:** Observable (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Detectability:** Calculate m_V:\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5`\n    `m_V = 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.50`\n    Since V = 18.50 is fainter than the 16.1 limit, it is not detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n### Summary\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Yes**\n*   b) Polaris: **No**\n*   c) Star @ 10 pc: **Yes**\n*   d) Star @ 200 pc: **No**\n*   e) Star @ 5 pc: **Yes**\n*   f) Star @ 50 pc: **No**\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
