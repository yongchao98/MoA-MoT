    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are fermions.\n    *   Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Define the Quantum States:**\n    *   For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n        where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the energy for a given level `n` is $E_n = n^2E$.\n    *   For each energy level `n`, a spin-1/2 particle can have two possible spin states: spin up ($m_s = +1/2$) and spin down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n    *   Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, a maximum of two fermions (one spin up, one spin down) can occupy any given energy level `n`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E₀):**\n    *   The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up, placing two particles in each level until all four particles are placed.\n    *   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1²E = E):** Place two particles here. The energy contributed is 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** Place the remaining two particles here. The energy contributed is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** E₀ = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E₁_excited):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. We create it by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2 and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   So, we move one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is:\n        *   **Level n=1:** 2 particles. Energy: 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n        *   **Level n=2:** 1 particle. Energy: 1 * E₂ = 4E.\n        *   **Level n=3 (E₃ = 3²E = 9E):** 1 particle. Energy: 1 * E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:** E₁_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E₂_excited):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions that result in an energy higher than the first excited state and choose the minimum one.\n    *   Let's consider promotions from the ground state configuration (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n        *   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n            *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n            *   Total Energy = 1*E₁ + 2*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 1*(E) + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        *   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n            *   Total Energy = 2*E₁ + 2*E₃ = 2*(E) + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4 (E₄ = 4²E = 16E).\n            *   Total Energy = 2*E₁ + 1*E₂ + 1*E₄ = 2*(E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of these excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the **Second Excited State Energy** is **18E**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
