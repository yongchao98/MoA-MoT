    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to sp² carbons of a C=C double bond. This is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   **\"One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: According to the n+1 rule, this means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Quartet (q)**: Coupled to 3 adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   **\"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a different single proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 adjacent protons (another CH₂ group).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the CH methine protons) in each structure. We will number the carbon chains starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ at C5 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dqt**. Neither signal matches the required `dtq` and `dtt` pair. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    The condensed formula `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid when the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is identified.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons:\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and the H's on the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets). This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets). This matches the other required signal.\n    *   Since this structure produces both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals, it is the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H's at C4 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n    *   Are there any other protons that would give a `dtq`? The other methine proton is at C2. H at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), giving a `dt`. There are no protons coupled to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃ group. Therefore, this structure cannot produce a `dtq` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Only the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, matching the experimental data perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
