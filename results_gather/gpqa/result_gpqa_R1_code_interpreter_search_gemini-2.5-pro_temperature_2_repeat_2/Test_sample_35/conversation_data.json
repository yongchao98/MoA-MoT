    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify the component of the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM) that corresponds to a specific absorption line. The line's energy (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) is observed from a source at a cosmological distance (2.1 Gpc).\n\n2.  **Account for Cosmological Redshift:** Light from distant objects is stretched as the universe expands, causing its wavelength to increase and its energy to decrease. This phenomenon is called redshift (z). The observed energy (E_obs) is related to the energy at the source (the rest-frame energy, E_rest) by the formula:\n    E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** We need to find the redshift corresponding to a distance of 2.1 Gpc. We can estimate this using Hubble's Law, z ≈ H₀ * d / c, where:\n    *   d = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc (since 1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc)\n    *   H₀ (Hubble Constant) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc (a commonly used value)\n    *   c (Speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n    Let's calculate z:\n    z ≈ (70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc) / 300,000 km/s\n    z ≈ 147,000 / 300,000 ≈ 0.49\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):** Now we can use the redshift to find the energy of the absorption line as it was emitted by the source.\n    *   E_obs = 3.9 * 10^-6 eV\n    *   z ≈ 0.49\n\n    E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * (1 + 0.49)\n    E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * 1.49\n    E_rest ≈ 5.811 * 10^-6 eV\n\n5.  **Identify the Transition:** The next step is to figure out what atomic or molecular transition corresponds to an energy of approximately 5.811 * 10^-6 eV. It's often easier to work with wavelength or frequency. Let's convert the energy to wavelength (λ) using the formula λ = hc/E:\n    *   h (Planck's constant) * c (speed of light) ≈ 1.24 * 10^-6 eV·m\n    *   λ ≈ (1.24 * 10^-6 eV·m) / (5.811 * 10^-6 eV) ≈ 0.213 meters or 21.3 cm.\n\n6.  **Match the Transition to the ISM:** A wavelength of 21 cm is one of the most famous spectral lines in radio astronomy. It is the **21 cm hydrogen line**, which arises from the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition in neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). This transition occurs when the spin of the electron changes its orientation relative to the spin of the proton.\n\n7.  **Determine the State of the ISM:** The 21 cm line can be observed in both emission and absorption.\n    *   **Emission:** Generally arises from widespread atomic hydrogen, particularly the Warm Atomic Interstellar Medium (T ~ 8000 K).\n    *   **Absorption:** Occurs when there is a cold cloud of atomic hydrogen between us and a brighter, background radio source. The cold gas (T ~ 100 K) absorbs radio waves at the 21 cm wavelength. Strong, narrow absorption lines are a classic signature of the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The observed line is the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line. In the Milky Way, this line seen in absorption is a primary tracer for the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nE_obs_eV = 3.9e-6  # Observed energy in eV\nd_Gpc = 2.1 # Distance in Gpc\nH0_km_s_Mpc = 70.0  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nc_km_s = 3.0e5      # Speed of light in km/s\nhc_eV_m = 1.2398e-6 # Planck's constant * speed of light in eV*m\n\n# 1. Convert distance to Mpc\nd_Mpc = d_Gpc * 1000\n\n# 2. Calculate redshift (z) using Hubble's Law approximation\nz = (H0_km_s_Mpc * d_Mpc) / c_km_s\n\n# 3. Calculate rest-frame energy (E_rest)\nE_rest_eV = E_obs_eV * (1 + z)\n\n# 4. Calculate rest-frame wavelength (lambda_rest)\nlambda_rest_m = hc_eV_m / E_rest_eV\nlambda_rest_cm = lambda_rest_m * 100\n\nprint(f\"Distance: {d_Gpc} Gpc\")\nprint(f\"Estimated Redshift (z): {z:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Rest-frame Energy (E_rest): {E_rest_eV:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-frame Wavelength (lambda_rest): {lambda_rest_cm:.2f} cm\")\nprint(\"\\nThis wavelength corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I).\")\nprint(\"Strong absorption at this line is a key indicator of the Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium.\")\n\n```\nDistance: 2.1 Gpc\nEstimated Redshift (z): 0.4900\nRest-frame Energy (E_rest): 5.8110e-06 eV\nRest-frame Wavelength (lambda_rest): 21.34 cm\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I).\nStrong absorption at this line is a key indicator of the Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium.\n\n<<<C>>>",
