    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes. So, the molecular mass is 156 u.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (~75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2% abundance). The molecule containing ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156 u, and the one containing ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158 u. The ratio of their abundances (~76:24) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 u and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The wide range is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in carboxylic acid dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, a carbonyl in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid appears around 1720-1680 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the very broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange with trace amounts of water.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. In such a symmetrical ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. This creates two sets of equivalent protons, which split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  **MS** tells us the compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (Molecular Mass = 7\\*12 + 5\\*1 + 35 + 2\\*16 = 156).\n2.  **IR** tells us the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and tells us the benzene ring is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** Chlorine and carboxylic acid are at the 1 and 4 (para) positions on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Fits MS:** Yes, M=156 with one Cl.\n    *   **Fits IR:** Yes, it is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Fits NMR:** Yes, it has the acidic proton (~11 ppm) and the para-substitution pattern (two doublets, each 2H). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid, and the 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring would give a more complex NMR signal (three distinct aromatic protons), not two doublets.\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. The lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a complex multiplet, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. It also lacks the acidic proton, so it would not have the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
