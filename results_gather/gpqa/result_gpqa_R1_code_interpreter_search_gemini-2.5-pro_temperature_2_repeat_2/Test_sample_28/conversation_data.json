    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To stop the synthesis, we need to create a mutation that renders the protein non-functional. The most effective way to do this is to cause a premature termination of protein synthesis or a complete alteration of the amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Understanding Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    1.  **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the resulting amino acid sequence. This is unlikely to affect protein function.\n    2.  **Missense Mutation:** A change that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *may* affect protein function, depending on the importance of the original amino acid, but it is not guaranteed to disable the protein.\n    3.  **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n    4.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the genetic code, changing every amino acid downstream of the mutation and often leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective knockout method.\n    5.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that *is* a multiple of three. This adds or removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. It can affect function but is less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Breaking Down the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    The sequence is read in triplets (codons) starting from the start codon `ATG`.\n    Intact gene: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...-3’`\n    Amino acids:   `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...`\n\n*   **Evaluating Each Mutant:**\n\n    1.  **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...-3’`\n        *   Comparison to intact:\n            *   Codon 2: `TTT` (Phe) -> `TTC` (Phe). This is a **silent** mutation.\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr). This is a **missense** mutation.\n        *   Effect: A single amino acid is changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    2.  **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...-3’`\n        *   Comparison to intact:\n            *   Codon 2: `TTT` (Phe) -> `TTC` (Phe). This is a **silent** mutation.\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAA` (Stop). This is a **nonsense** mutation.\n        *   Effect: This mutation introduces a premature stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This will eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n    3.  **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...-3’`\n        *   Comparison to intact:\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr). **Missense** mutation.\n            *   Codon 6: `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). **Missense** mutation.\n            *   Codon 7: `TCT` -> `ACT` (Ser -> Thr). **Missense** mutation (based on the original full sequence `...GGTACTTCT...`).\n        *   Effect: Multiple amino acids are changed, but the protein is still produced at full length. While this is more likely to be disruptive than a single missense mutation, it's not as definitive a knockout as a premature stop codon.\n\n    4.  **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ...-3’` (after deleting `GGT`)\n        *   Comparison to intact: The `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted from the sequence (relative to the otherwise identical Mutant 3 sequence).\n        *   Effect: This is an **in-frame deletion** (a 3-base deletion). It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein but does not change the downstream reading frame. This will alter the protein but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    To most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need the mutation that is most likely to completely destroy the protein's function. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** creates a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to achieve the desired outcome among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
