    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate and compare the magnitudes of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\langle H \\rangle$ and the transition energy $\\Delta E$ of a Hydrogen atom.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)\n\nThe energy of the paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) for an electron in a magnetic field is given by the formula:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nwhere:\n*   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it has a \"small value\", so we'll use $m=1$ to determine the order of magnitude.\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant.\n*   $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, given as $B = 1$ T.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is approximately $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T.\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = 1 \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\langle H \\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is therefore approximately $10^{-23}$ Joules.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ can be calculated from the given wavelength $\\lambda$ of the emitted/absorbed photon using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n$\\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the transition energy is therefore approximately $10^{-19}$ Joules.\n\n### 3. Comparison of Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 10^{-23}$ J\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 10^{-19}$ J\n\nTo compare them, we can find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is very small ($2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$), it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much smaller than the transition energy.\n$\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nTherefore, the Zeeman splitting of energy levels due to the magnetic field is significantly smaller than the energy difference between the principal energy levels of the hydrogen atom (in this case, the transition from n=4 to n=2, corresponding to the given Balmer series wavelength).\n\nThe correct comparison is that the paramagnetic coupling term is much, much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
