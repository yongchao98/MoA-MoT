    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor. Let's establish the relationship between these quantities.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles $N$ remaining from an initial sample $N_0$ after a time $t$ in the particle's rest frame (proper time) is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    where $\\tau$ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Due to special relativity, a particle moving with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ has its lifetime dilated in the lab frame. If the lifetime in the lab frame is $T$, then $T = \\gamma \\tau$. This is the mean lifetime as measured by an observer in the lab.\n\n3.  **Travel Time in the Lab Frame:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius $R = 30$ m. They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity, which means their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is:\n    $t_{travel} = R/v \\approx R/c$.\n\n4.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles, $f$, that reach the detector wall is the ratio $N/N_0$. We can find this by evaluating the decay law at the travel time $t_{travel}$ using the dilated lifetime $T$:\n    $f = \\frac{N(t_{travel})}{N_0} = e^{-t_{travel}/T}$\n    Substituting the expressions for $t_{travel}$ and $T$:\n    $f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau)}$\n    $f = e^{-R/(c\\gamma\\tau)}$\n\n5.  **Setting up the Equations:** We have two scenarios.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = 20$\n        *   Survival fraction, $f_1 = 1/3$\n        *   $1/3 = e^{-R/(c\\gamma_1\\tau)} = e^{-30/(c \\cdot 20 \\cdot \\tau)}$\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2 = ?$ (what we need to find)\n        *   Survival fraction, $f_2 = 2/3$\n        *   $2/3 = e^{-R/(c\\gamma_2\\tau)} = e^{-30/(c \\gamma_2 \\tau)}$\n\n6.  **Solving for $\\gamma_2$:**\n    To solve this, let's take the natural logarithm of the equation for the survival fraction:\n    $\\ln(f) = -R/(c\\gamma\\tau)$\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    $\\gamma \\ln(f) = -R/(c\\tau)$\n    Or, more conveniently:\n    $\\gamma \\ln(1/f) = R/(c\\tau)$\n\n    Since $R$, $c$, and $\\tau$ are constants throughout the experiment, the term $R/(c\\tau)$ is constant. Therefore, we can set up a proportion:\n    $\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n    Now, we can plug in the known values:\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = 20$\n    *   $f_1 = 1/3 \\implies 1/f_1 = 3$\n    *   $f_2 = 2/3 \\implies 1/f_2 = 3/2 = 1.5$\n\n    $20 \\cdot \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\cdot \\ln(1.5)$\n\n    Solving for $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = 20 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(1.5)}$\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    To get a precise numerical value, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_1 = 20\n# Fraction of particles reaching the detector in the first case\nf1 = 1/3\n# Fraction of particles reaching the detector in the second case\nf2 = 2/3\n\n# The relationship derived from the decay law is gamma * ln(1/f) = constant.\n# Therefore, gamma_1 * ln(1/f1) = gamma_2 * ln(1/f2)\n# Solving for gamma_2:\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(1/f1) / math.log(1/f2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.19018519635904\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "The fraction of particles, $f$, that survive after traveling a distance $R$ is given by the formula:\n$f = e^{-t_{travel} / T_{lab}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $t_{travel}$ is the travel time in the lab frame. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, $c$. Thus, $t_{travel} \\approx R/c$.\n*   $T_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame. Due to time dilation, this is related to the particle's proper mean lifetime, $\\tau$, by $T_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival fraction equation, we get:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau)} = e^{-R/(c\\gamma\\tau)}$\n\nTo solve for the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the survival fraction, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = - \\frac{R}{c\\gamma\\tau}$\n\nRearranging the equation, we find:\n$\\gamma \\ln(f) = - \\frac{R}{c\\tau}$\n\nSince $R$, $c$, and $\\tau$ are constants for this experiment, the term $-R/(c\\tau)$ is a constant. Therefore, the product $\\gamma \\ln(f)$ must be constant. It's often more convenient to work with positive logarithms by inverting the fraction:\n$\\gamma \\ln(1/f) = \\frac{R}{c\\tau} = \\text{constant}$\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n1.  $\\gamma_1 = 20$, and the survival fraction is $f_1 = 1/3$.\n2.  $\\gamma_2$ is unknown, and the survival fraction is $f_2 = 2/3$.\n\nUsing the relationship we derived, we can set the two scenarios equal to each other:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\gamma_1 \\frac{\\ln(1/f_1)}{\\ln(1/f_2)}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(1/(1/3))}{\\ln(1/(2/3))}$\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(1.5)}$\n\nUsing the provided calculation result:\n$\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$\n$\\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.4055$\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 20 \\cdot \\frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 20 \\cdot 2.709 \\approx 54.18$\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.2.
