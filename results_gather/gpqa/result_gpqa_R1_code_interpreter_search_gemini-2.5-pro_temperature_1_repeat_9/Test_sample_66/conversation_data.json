    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital ($l_1=1$, $l_2=1$). Their angular momenta are coupled to form a total angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    The key quantum numbers for the total system are the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state to be measured.**\n    A measurement is made on the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* measurements.\n    The eigenvalue of $L_{iz}$ is $m_i\\hbar$. Therefore, getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to finding the first electron in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    Similarly, getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to finding the second electron in a state with $m_2 = -1$.\n    The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial state to the measured state.**\n    The initial coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ (short for $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$). The coefficients of this expansion are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted as $<l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m>$.\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m> |m_1, m_2>$\n\n    The probability of finding the system in the specific uncoupled state $|m_1', m_2'>$ upon measurement is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficient in the expansion:\n    $P(m_1', m_2') = |<l_1, m_1', l_2, m_2' | l, m>|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rules for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.**\n    A fundamental property (or selection rule) of adding angular momenta is that the total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is zero.\n\n5.  **Check the selection rule for this specific problem.**\n    *   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The measured state has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for the measured state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to the system's total $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero:\n    $<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The joint probability of measuring $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This means that it is impossible to find the system, which is in a state with total $m=-1$, in a configuration where the sum of its parts is $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use Python to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Define the quantum numbers of the target measurement outcome\nm1_target = -1\nm2_target = -1\n\n# The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is <l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>\n# The probability is the square of this coefficient.\n\n# The sympy CG function takes the arguments (j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m)\ncoefficient = CG(l1, m1_target, l2, m2_target, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude\nprobability = abs(coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is: {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is: 0\nThe probability is: 0\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, and therefore the probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This means:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of the first electron is $l_1 = 1$.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of the second electron is $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system is $l = 2$.\n    *   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the z-components of the *individual* electrons' orbital angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target Final State:** We want to find the probability of getting specific eigenvalues for both measurements:\n    *   For $L_{1z}$, the desired eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For $L_{2z}$, the desired eigenvalue is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This target final state is an uncoupled state, which can be written as $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum's Z-Component:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the selection rule:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    Any component $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ that contributes to the expansion of the total state $|l, m\\rangle$ must satisfy this condition. If $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, then the probability of finding the system in the state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is zero.\n\n5.  **Check the Condition for this Problem:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the target final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total $m$ of the system with the sum required by the measurement outcome:\n    *   $m_{system} = -1$\n    *   $m_{measurement} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n\n    Since $m_{system} \\neq m_{measurement}$, it is physically impossible for the system, which is in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$, to be found in a configuration where the sum of its parts has a z-component of $-2\\hbar$. The projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero.\n\n    The probability is the square of this projection (which is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>$). Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, this coefficient is zero.\n\n    Therefore, the joint probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
