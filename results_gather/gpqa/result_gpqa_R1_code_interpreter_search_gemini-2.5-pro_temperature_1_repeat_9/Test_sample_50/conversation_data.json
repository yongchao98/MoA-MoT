    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nTo solve this, we use the **method of images**. This method allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center), matching the boundary condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Location (b)\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. The image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the origin, along the same line as `q`.\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, the potential from `q` and `q'` must cancel out everywhere on the surface. The standard derivation for this setup yields the following for the image charge and its location:\n\n*   **Location of image charge (b):**\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):**\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge and is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. An elegant way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all other charges in the system. In our case, \"all other charges\" refers to the induced charge on the surface of the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charge is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. So, we need to find the potential created by `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   **The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.**\n*   **The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.**\n*   **The distance between `q` and `q'` is:**\n    `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and the distance:\n\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nFinally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 5. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's compare our result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
