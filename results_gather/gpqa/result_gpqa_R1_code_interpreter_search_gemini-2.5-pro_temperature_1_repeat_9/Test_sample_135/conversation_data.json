    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ · f) dV`.\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` is defined as:\n*   Its direction is purely radial from the origin.\n*   Its magnitude is `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n\nIn vector form, using spherical coordinates, the field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses `V`.\n\n`∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∮_S (f · dS)`\n\n*   **Note on the singularity:** The vector field `f` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r=0`). While this means the conditions for the Divergence Theorem are not strictly met *at that single point*, the theorem can still be used. The physical interpretation is that the total \"source strength\" (the volume integral of the divergence) inside a volume is equal to the total \"flow\" (flux) out of its boundary surface. The singularity at the origin acts as a point source.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the surface integral (the flux) over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **The Surface (S):** The surface is a sphere of constant radius `r = R`.\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On this surface, the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` points radially outward. Its magnitude is the area of a small patch on the surface. In spherical coordinates, this is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product `f · dS`**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] · [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n\nThe dot product of the unit vector with itself is `r_hat · r_hat = 1`. The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n`f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat · r_hat)`\n`f · dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**5. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nNow we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f · dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`= ( ∫_0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\nEvaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiply the results:\n`∮_S (f · dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we were asked to find is equal to this surface integral.\n\n`∫_V (∇ · f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is a fundamental concept in physics, representing the strength of a point source. The total flux from a `1/r^2` field is `4π`, regardless of the radius of the enclosing sphere (as long as it encloses the source).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
