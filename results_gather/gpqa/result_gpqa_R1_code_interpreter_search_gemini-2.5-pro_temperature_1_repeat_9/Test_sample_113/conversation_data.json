    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate: `(CH3)(CH2CH3)C(O⁻)(CN)`.\n        2.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite is used in a different addition reaction with carbonyls, mainly for purification, and is not the proton source in this context.\n        *   `H3O⁺`: The hydronium ion is the chemical species that represents an acid in an aqueous solution. It is an excellent source of protons. The reaction is typically carried out by mixing NaCN with an acid (to generate HCN *in situ*) or by adding acid in a subsequent step (workup). `H3O⁺` correctly represents this required acidic condition or workup step.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is `H3O⁺`. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically either a strong acid or a strong base with heating.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. The final product is the carboxylic acid directly.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be treated with acid in a separate step to produce the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water, acts as the catalyst and reagent for the hydrolysis. Since the product is the carboxylic acid itself, an acid-catalyzed pathway is a direct route.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable reagent for this transformation is the strong acid, `HCl`.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is `H3O⁺`.\n    *   Reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
