As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii.

    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine which of the two planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and by what factor.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `p_transit = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given, but it can be related to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law.\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n    Rearranging this to solve for `a`, we get:\n    `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Express Transit Probability in Terms of Knowns:** Substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n    `p_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities:** To compare the two planets, we'll find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`p_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_2`).\n    `Ratio = p_1 / p_2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P_1^2)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P_2^2)^(1/3)]`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2)]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Information:** Now, we plug in the relationships provided in the problem statement:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's host: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio equation:\n    `Ratio = (1) * [(M_s2 * P_2^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)^2)]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   First, square the term `(P_2 / 3)`: `(P_2 / 3)^2 = P_2^2 / 9`.\n    *   Now the equation is: `Ratio = [(M_s2 * P_2^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_2^2 / 9)]^(1/3)`\n    *   Cancel out the `M_s2` and `P_2^2` terms from the numerator and denominator:\n        `Ratio = [1 / (2 / 9)]^(1/3)`\n    *   Simplify the fraction inside the bracket: `1 / (2/9) = 9/2 = 4.5`.\n    *   The equation becomes: `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    `Ratio ≈ 1.65096`\n    This means that `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`. Therefore, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n\nBased on this calculation, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
