    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho,para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Sequential substitution on a ring with meta-directors.** A powerful strategy for getting a 1,3,5-pattern is to have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring, as they will both direct a third incoming group to the same position. For example, starting with 3-nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -NO2 at C3), both groups would direct an incoming bromine to C5. This leads to the sequence:\n        1.  Acylation (to get acetophenone).\n        2.  Nitration (to get 3-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  Bromination (to get the final product).\n        This logical sequence (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not among the options.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Use of a temporary directing group.** Another common method for complex substitution patterns is to use a powerful directing group (like -NH2) to place other groups correctly, and then remove it via diazotization and deamination (e.g., using NaNO2/HCl followed by H3PO2). The presence of these reagents in the options suggests this strategy might be relevant.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... This sequence starts with nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing it, and then removing the diazonium group with H3PO2. This sequence of steps simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...\n        *   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene (this gives a mixture, with the 4-nitro isomer being major, but let's assume we get the meta product).\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and especially -NO2). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D:** This is a long sequence involving deamination reagents. Let's trace it:\n        *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline (reduction).\n        *   iii) Aniline -> Acetanilide (N-acylation to protect the amine).\n        *   iv) Acetanilide -> p-Bromoacetanilide (bromination occurs para to the activating -NHCOCH3 group).\n        *   v) p-Bromoacetanilide -> 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide (nitration is directed by the stronger activating -NHCOCH3 group to its ortho position).\n        *   The remaining steps (vi, vii) are for deamination. This would first require hydrolysis of the acetanilide to an aniline, and then removal of the -NH2 group. The final product of this entire pathway would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target ketone. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n        *   i) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n        *   ii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This is a standard reaction.\n        *   iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration:** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects are in conflict. -COCH3 directs to C5. -Br directs to C2, C4, C6. While this would typically produce a mixture of isomers, the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro product is among them. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are clearly non-viable, this path is the most plausible. The formation of the 1,3,5-isomer is often favored due to steric hindrance at the other possible positions (2, 4, and 6).\n        *   The subsequent steps (iv to vii) in option A are nonsensical if the target molecule is already formed in step (iii). They seem to be included as distractors.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the options, Option A provides the most direct and chemically plausible route to the target molecule, despite the potential for side products in the nitration step. The other options contain fatal flaws, such as non-viable reactions or the synthesis of an incorrect final molecule. Therefore, Option A represents the best choice for a high-yield synthesis among the given sequences.\n\n<<<A>>>"
