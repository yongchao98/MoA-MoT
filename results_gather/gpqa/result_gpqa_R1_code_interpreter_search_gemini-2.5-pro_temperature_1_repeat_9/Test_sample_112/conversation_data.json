    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is key; while alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n    *Conclusion from 1H NMR:* This supports the conclusion from the FTIR data that an alkene is present.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is observed. Let's calculate the mass of the most likely fragment from a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺, is: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45.\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n    *Conclusion from Mass Spec:* This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The combined spectral data indicate that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   This means the molecule must contain:\n        1.  A C=O double bond.\n        2.  A C=C double bond.\n        3.  Two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group).\n\n    *   Now, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the structure. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds).\n        *   One C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    *   Let's check the proposed molecular formulas:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n            *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            *   Contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n            *   This formula has the correct DoU (2) and the correct number of oxygens (2) for an unsaturated carboxylic acid. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            *   This DoU is too low. It could represent a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot have the C=C double bond required by the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **C) C6H10O:**\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            *   The DoU is correct, but it only has one oxygen atom. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid, which requires two oxygens.\n        *   **D) C6H12O:**\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            *   The DoU is incorrect, and it only has one oxygen atom.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly the molecular formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, which points unequivocally to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
