    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the Cartesian components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the spin-1/2 operators, where $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, and $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi = 0$. Assuming the vector is not solely along the z-axis (where $\\sin\\theta=0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi=0$, which means $\\phi=0$ or $\\phi=\\pi$. Let's choose the standard convention where $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. Here, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (i) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    (ii) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    From equation (i):\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    This means $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a=1$ for simplicity, giving the unnormalized vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To remove the fraction, we can multiply by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$, yielding another unnormalized eigenvector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle_{unnormalized} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. Let the normalized eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The squared norm is $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$.\n    Since $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$, we have $|C|^2 = 1$. We can choose the simplest phase, $C=1$.\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated elements $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ match option D."
