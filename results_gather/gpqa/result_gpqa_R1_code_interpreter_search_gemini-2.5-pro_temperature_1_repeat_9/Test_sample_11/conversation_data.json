    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay of a stationary particle. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Understand the decay process:**\nThe decay is given by:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\nA stationary positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n\n*   The initial particle (pion) is at rest.\n*   The final particles (muon and neutrino) move away from each other.\n*   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless.\n\n**2. List the given information:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (`m_pi * c^2`) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (`m_mu * c^2`) = 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass of nu (`m_nu * c^2`) = 0 MeV (assumed)\n*   The initial pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero (`p_pi = 0`).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `p_pi = p_mu + p_nu`\n    Since the pion is at rest, `p_pi = 0`.\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `E_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n    Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy:\n    `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`\n    The total energy of the final particles is the sum of their individual total energies:\n    `E_mu` (total energy of muon)\n    `E_nu` (total energy of neutrino)\n    So, `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` of a particle are related by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the massive muon (`mu+`):\n    `E_mu^2 = (p_mu*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n*   For the massless neutrino (`nu`):\n    `E_nu^2 = (p_nu*c)^2 + (m_nu*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`\n    `E_nu = p*c`\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**5. Solve for the unknowns:**\nWe have a system of equations. Let's solve for `p*c` first.\nFrom energy conservation: `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`\n\nNow substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n`(m_pi*c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nRearrange to solve for `p*c`:\n`2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`p*c = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\n**6. Calculate the numerical values:**\nWe can use a python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate p*c using the derived formula\n# p*c = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]\np_c = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its energy, which is p*c\nKE_nu = p_c\n\n# The total energy released (Q-value) is distributed as kinetic energy of the products.\n# Q_value = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# The Q-value is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies.\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon can be found from the Q-value.\nKE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\n\n# We use ':.2f' to format the output to two decimal places for easier comparison with the options.\nprint(f\"KE_mu = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE_nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n```output\nKE_mu = 4.12 MeV\nKE_nu = 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a particle physics problem involving the decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** A stationary positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Reaction: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n    *   Initial State: The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero (`p_pi = 0`). Its initial energy is its rest energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `E_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n    Substituting the rest energy for the pion:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` of a particle are related by the equation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n    *   For the massive muon (`mu+`):\n        `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    *   For the neutrino (`nu`), we assume it is massless (`m_nu = 0`):\n        `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0^2`  => `E_nu = p*c`\n        Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy: `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    We now have a system of equations to solve. We can express `E_mu` in terms of `E_nu` from the energy conservation equation:\n    `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    `(m_pi*c^2 - E_nu)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n    Since `E_nu = p*c`, we can replace `(p*c)^2` with `E_nu^2`:\n    `(m_pi*c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n    Expand the left side:\n    `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n    The `E_nu^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we solve for `E_nu`:\n    `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_nu`\n    `E_nu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\n    The kinetic energy of the neutrino is `KE_nu = E_nu`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`):**\n    The total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the reaction) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\n    `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - (m_mu*c^2 + m_nu*c^2)`\n    Since `m_nu = 0`:\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2`\n    Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is:\n    `KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2) - KE_nu`\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Let's plug in the given values:\n    *   Rest mass energy of Pi+ (`m_pi*c^2`) = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of mu+ (`m_mu*c^2`) = 105.7 MeV\n\n    First, calculate `KE_nu`:\n    `KE_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `KE_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n    Next, calculate `KE_mu`:\n    `KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78 ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\n    The calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
