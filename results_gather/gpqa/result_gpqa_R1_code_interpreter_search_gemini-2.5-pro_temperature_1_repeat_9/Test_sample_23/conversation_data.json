    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   The problem states that hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1, we get: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be Y'.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (CnH2n) gives Z itself, as it's already saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must also yield Z (CnH2n). For this to happen, Y' must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   If Y' were another saturated compound (like an isomer of Z), hydrogenation would not convert it to Z (it might cause ring-opening to an acyclic alkane, but that would result in a different product).\n    *   The most plausible candidate for Y' is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromatic hydrocarbons do not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   A monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with n carbon atoms has the general formula CnH(2n-6) (e.g., benzene C6H6, toluene C7H8).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (CnH(2n-6)). Hydrogenating this mixture would convert the aromatic part to CnH2n, resulting in a single product, Z. This fits all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The conversion of X to Y is a disproportionation reaction upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`. Since the starting mixture X and product mixture Y are both equimolar, this is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   Substituting the formulas for the components of Y: `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X1 and X2 must equal the total in Y1 and Y2. Let X1 be CnHx and X2 be CnH(y). Then `x + y = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives only Z (CnH2n). This means X1 and X2 are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same n-carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The most logical candidates for X1 and X2 are the corresponding cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   Let's check if these fit the hydrogen balance: `(2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)) loses 2 hydrogen atoms to become the aromatic compound (CnH(2n-6)), and the cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) gains these 2 hydrogen atoms to become the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in CnH(2n-2) and CnH(2n-4), which is `4n - 6`.\n    *   Now we need to find 'n'. The problem states Z is a \"widely used solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7).\n    *   Let's test the possible answers, which represent the total number of hydrogen atoms (4n-6):\n        *   If Total H = 18 (Option A): `18 = 4n - 6` => `4n = 24` => `n = 6`. This corresponds to Z being cyclohexane. The components of X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The sum of H atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a valid solution.\n        *   If Total H = 22 (Option C): `22 = 4n - 6` => `4n = 28` => `n = 7`. This corresponds to Z being methylcyclohexane. The components of X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of H atoms is 12 + 10 = 22. This is also a chemically plausible solution.\n        *   The other options, 12 and 16, do not yield integer values for 'n'.\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios (n=6 and n=7). However, the set of reactions described (hydrogen transfer between a diene and an alkene to yield an aromatic and an alkane) is a classic textbook example in organic chemistry, almost always illustrated with the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene). Given the context of such a problem, the most fundamental and common example is the intended answer.\n    *   Therefore, we conclude that n=6.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The system is based on C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
