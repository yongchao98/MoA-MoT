    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation for the given molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecule and Count Atoms and Bonds**\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   We can draw the structure to visualize the bonds.\n         CH3                                     CH3\n          \\                                     /\n           C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C\n          /              |                 \\\n        CH3              CH3                 CH3\n    *   **C-H Bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C Bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C Bonds:** To find the number of single C-C bonds, we can use the fact that for a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms (single and double) is one less than the number of carbon atoms.\n        *   Total carbon atoms = 12\n        *   Total C-C and C=C bonds = 12 - 1 = 11\n        *   Since there are 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔHat, compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We sum the bond energies of all bonds present.\n\nΔHat, compound = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nΔHat, compound = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHat, compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔHat, compound = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements (ΔHat, elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n12 C(graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need the energy to perform the following atomization:\n12 C(graphite) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nΔHat, elements = (12 × ΔHat(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔHat, elements = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHat, elements = 12000 + 1100\nΔHat, elements = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the gaseous atoms from the elements and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\n\nΔHf = ΔHat, elements - ΔHat, compound\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Check the Options and Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option C has the correct number but the wrong unit (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, a common distractor.\nLet's convert our answer to kJ/g to check Option B.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   ΔHf (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches Option B.\n\n```python\n# Values from the problem\ndelta_h_at_c = 1000\nbe_h_h = 100\nbe_c_c = 200\nbe_c_c_double = 300\nbe_c_h = 400\n\n# Counts from the molecular structure C12H22\nnum_c_atoms = 12\nnum_h_atoms = 22\nnum_c_c_bonds = 9\nnum_c_c_double_bonds = 2\nnum_c_h_bonds = 22\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the compound\ndelta_h_at_compound = (num_c_c_bonds * be_c_c) + (num_c_c_double_bonds * be_c_c_double) + (num_c_h_bonds * be_c_h)\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the elements\ndelta_h_at_elements = (num_c_atoms * delta_h_at_c) + ((num_h_atoms / 2) * be_h_h)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_hf_mol = delta_h_at_elements - delta_h_at_compound\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass = num_c_atoms * 12 + num_h_atoms * 1\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\ndelta_hf_gram = delta_hf_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"The enthalpy of formation is {delta_hf_mol} kJ/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The molar mass is {molar_mass} g/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The enthalpy of formation is {round(delta_hf_gram, 2)} kJ/g.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) can be calculated using the following relationship:\n\n**ΔHf = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]**\n\nLet's break down the calculation step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\n\nThe molecule is **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2**.\n\n*   **Count the atoms:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Count the bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds between the 12 carbon atoms in a non-cyclic structure is 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n**12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔHat(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2: This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule (enthalpy of atomization of the product).**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the product. It's the sum of all bond energies in the C12H22 molecule.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n\n*   Total bond energy of the product = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\n\nΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ\n**ΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Convert the units to match the options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g.\n\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   ΔHf in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
