    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). This means that the initial particles disappear, and their total energy is converted into new particles. The reaction is:\n$p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n\nThis means one proton and one antiproton annihilate to produce four new particles: two of type $A^{+}$ and two of type $A^{-}$. We can assume $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair and have the same mass, $m_A$.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nIn any particle interaction, energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in physics problems, implying that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest energy. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. The rest energy is given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, $E = mc^2$.\n        *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) ≈ 938.3 MeV.\n        *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also ≈ 938.3 MeV.\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** Since the particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$), all with the same mass $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. The four particles will fly off in different directions such that their vector sum of momenta is zero.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the initial state (zero momentum) and the final particles having identical masses, the total energy will be distributed equally among them. Therefore, each of the four final particles will have the same energy $E_A$ and the same speed $v$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**3. Set up and Solve the Equation**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nNow we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$ (often expressed as $\\beta = v/c$).\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSince $\\beta = v/c$, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with higher precision, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use the standard value for proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n# Given rest mass energy for particle A\nm_A_c2 = 300.0\n\n# From energy conservation: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta = v/c using the relation: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# The velocity is v = beta * c\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe script confirms the result.\n\nFinal Answer is approximately 0.77c. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n**1. Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies. The rest energy is given by Einstein's formula $E = mc^2$.\n*   The rest mass of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest energy is also $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n*   We are given that the rest energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since the initial system was at rest (zero total momentum), the final particles must fly apart in such a way that the total momentum is also zero. By symmetry, the total initial energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles.\n*   Each of the four particles will have the same total energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\n**4. Solve for Velocity (v)**\n\nFirst, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. We'll solve for $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
