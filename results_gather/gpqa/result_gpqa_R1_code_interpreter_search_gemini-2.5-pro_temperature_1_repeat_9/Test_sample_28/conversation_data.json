This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "*   **Goal:** To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by inactivating the gene that produces it. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to ensure it can no longer produce a functional protein.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the beginning of translation.\n    *   The sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons.\n    *   Intact sequence codons: `ATG` (Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `CTC` (Leu) - `GCT` (Ala) - `GGT` (Gly) - ...\n    *   This sequence of codons is translated into a chain of amino acids, which folds into a functional protein (likely an enzyme).\n\n*   **Evaluating Each Mutation:** We need to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Intact:  `...TTTCTCG...`\n        *   Mutant 1: `...TTCTACG...`\n        *   The change appears to be `CTC` (Leucine) becoming `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**—it changes one amino acid for another. While this *could* disrupt the protein's function, it's not guaranteed. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Intact:  `...TTTCTCG...`\n        *   Mutant 2: `...TTCTAAG...`\n        *   The change is `CTC` (Leucine) becoming `TAA`.\n        *   `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with `TAG` and `TGA`).\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. When the ribosome encounters this `TAA` codon, it will stop translation.\n        *   The resulting protein will be extremely short, only containing the first two amino acids (Methionine and Phenylalanine). A protein this truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a knockout mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Intact:  `...TTTCTCG...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `...TTTTACG...`\n        *   This appears to be an insertion of a `T` nucleotide after the `TTT` codon.\n        *   Intact reading frame: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant 3 reading frame: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...`\n        *   This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion of a single nucleotide shifts the entire reading frame. All codons downstream from the insertion will be different, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence. Frameshift mutations often create a premature stop codon downstream. While this is also a very effective way to inactivate a gene, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is more direct and its effect is immediate and certain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Intact:  `...CTCGCTGGTA...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `...TACGCTACTT...`\n        *   This sequence has multiple changes. One plausible interpretation is the deletion of the `GGT` codon, which would remove one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein. Deleting a single amino acid might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein. Another possibility is a frameshift, similar to Mutant 3.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The most certain way to eliminate the protein's function among the given options is to introduce a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position. This will result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
