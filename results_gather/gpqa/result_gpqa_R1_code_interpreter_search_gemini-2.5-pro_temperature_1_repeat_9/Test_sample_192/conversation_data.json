    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it `N`) varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** The definition of stellar parallax is that it is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to the star.\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `plx ∝ r⁻¹`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** Now, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into our initial equation for the number of stars.\n    *   Since `N ∝ plx⁻⁵` and `plx ∝ r⁻¹`, we can substitute `r⁻¹` for `plx`.\n    *   `N ∝ (r⁻¹)⁻⁵`\n    *   `N ∝ r⁵`\n\n4.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance (r)*. This is not the total cumulative number of stars up to a distance `r` (which is `N ∝ r⁵`), but rather the number of stars in a small shell of distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** To find the number of stars per unit distance, we need to differentiate our expression for `N` with respect to `r`.\n    *   Let `N(r) = k * r⁵` where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance is `dN/dr`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Proportionality:** From the derivative, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n7.  **Match with Options:** This result, `~ r⁴`, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
