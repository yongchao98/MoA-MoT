    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (V_r) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = V_r / c\n    The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as K.\n    K = (c / λ₀) * Δλ_max\n    Since c (speed of light) and λ₀ (rest wavelength of the spectral line) are constants, the RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift Δλ_max.\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n3.  **Establish the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Δλ_max,1 = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ_max,2 = 7 miliangstrom\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ_max,1 / Δλ_max,2 = 5 / 7\n\n4.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K for a planet in an orbit is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [M_p * sin(i) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))\n    Where:\n    *   P = Orbital Period\n    *   M_p = Planet mass\n    *   M_star = Star mass\n    *   i = Orbital inclination\n    *   e = Orbital eccentricity\n    *   G = Gravitational constant\n\n5.  **Simplify the Formula based on Given Information:**\n    *   **Circular orbits:** e = 0, so the term `1 / sqrt(1 - e²)` becomes 1.\n    *   **Planet mass << Star mass:** M_p is similar to Neptune's mass, and M_star is similar to the Sun's mass. M_neptune is much smaller than M_sun, so (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n    The simplified formula becomes:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]\n\n6.  **Determine the Proportionality between K and P:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   M_star1 = M_star2\n    *   M_p1 = M_p2\n    *   The problem does not specify the inclinations (i). For a solvable problem, we must assume that the conditions are comparable, which implies sin(i) is the same for both systems. This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n    Under these conditions, all terms in the simplified formula for K are constant for both systems, except for P.\n    K ≈ C * (1/P)^(1/3) = C * P^(-1/3)\n    Where C is a constant.\n    This shows that the RV amplitude K is proportional to the orbital period P raised to the power of -1/3.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write the relationship between the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n    Now, substitute the ratio of the amplitudes we found in step 3:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now we perform the calculation.\n    ```python\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    0.3644314868804665\n    </execute_result>\n    The result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.364 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
