    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Proton Count and Chemical Formula:**\n*   First, let's sum the integrations of the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible options:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The structure is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 (from the acetate CH3) + 1 (vinylic H) + 1 (vinylic H) + 3 (from the propenyl CH3) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The structure would be CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the total proton count, we can immediately eliminate both \"butenyl acetate\" options (C and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signals and their Multiplicities:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet (s) for 3 protons at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate functional group (CH3-COO-). Both remaining options, Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate, contain this group.\n\n*   **The Vinylic Protons and J-Coupling:** We have two signals in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond):\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   These two protons are on the double bond and are coupled to each other. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons is stereochemically dependent:\n        *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically ranges from **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) typically ranges from **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed J-value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This strongly indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\n*   **Assembling the Rest of the Molecule:**\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). This proton is the most deshielded because it is on the same carbon as the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester group (-O-CH=).\n    *   The signal at **5.5 ppm** is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the trans proton at 7.0 ppm. The quartet (q) must be due to coupling with a neighboring group of three protons (a CH3 group).\n    *   The signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** confirms this. It's a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single proton. This is the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**3. Final Identification:**\n*   The molecule has an acetate group.\n*   It has a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   The two protons on the double bond are in a *trans* configuration (J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect, would have a smaller J-coupling constant.\nB) Trans-propenyl acetate: Correct, matches all aspects of the NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, multiplicities, and coupling constant).\nC) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, has the wrong number of protons.\nD) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, has the wrong number of protons and would have a smaller J-coupling.\n\n<<<B>>>"
