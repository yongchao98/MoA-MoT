    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism for each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to find the intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions:**\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted, but for spontaneous decay, the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n'',l'',m''\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'' = 1$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = m'' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m'' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $n$:** For decay, $n'' < 3$. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has $n''=2$. This is the most probable transition since the rate depends on the cube of the transition energy ($\\omega^3$), and the $3 \\to 2$ energy gap is smaller than $3 \\to 1$, but the radial integral heavily favors the smallest possible change in $n$. The transition $3s \\to 1p$ is not possible as the $1p$ state does not exist. Thus, the only possible intermediate state is of the form $|2,1,m''\\rangle$.\n    *   **Conclusion for step 1:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition step: $|2,1,m''\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state (intermediate):** $|2,1,m''\\rangle$, so $n''=2, l''=1$.\n    *   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_{final}=1, l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   **Selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m'' = 0 - m''$.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,0\\rangle$ ($m''=0$), then $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,1\\rangle$ ($m''=1$), then $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ ($m''=-1$), then $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n    *   **Conclusion for step 2:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This means all three paths are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of the transition paths.**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m''\\rangle)$\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the $2p$ state.\n        The transition rates $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'')$ are proportional to the square of the transition matrix element $|\\langle 2,1,m'' | e\\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. A detailed calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or direct integration) confirms that the rates are identical for $m''=-1, 0, +1$.\n        Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m''\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        We need to consider all possible decay channels from the $|2,1,m''\\rangle$ state (the $2p$ state). According to the E1 selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For decay, the final state must have a lower energy, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only state satisfying these conditions is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). There are no $d$-states with $n<2$.\n        Therefore, the *only* possible E1 decay from the $2p$ state is to the $1s$ state. This means the probability of this step is 1, regardless of the value of $m''$.\n        $P(|2,1,m''\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three cascade paths is $P(\\text{path}) = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct path and probability**)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that presents a correct transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
