    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction type.**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine (Br) atom, and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium (D) atom. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Elimination-Addition (Benzyne mechanism). The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the strong base to initiate the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the benzyne intermediate(s).**\nThe benzyne intermediate is formed by the elimination of HBr (or in this case, HBr or DBr). The amide ion abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n1.  **Position C-2:** This carbon has a deuterium (D) atom.\n2.  **Position C-6:** This carbon has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the proton from C-6 or the deuteron from C-2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6, creating a carbanion at this position.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and immediately eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-6. The resulting intermediate is a benzyne molecule where the deuterium atom is still at position C-2. This is called **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   This pathway involves breaking a C-H bond, which is generally faster than breaking a C-D bond (due to the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this is the **major** pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2, creating a carbanion at this position.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   This pathway involves breaking a C-D bond, which is slower than breaking a C-H bond. This is the **minor** pathway, but it is still possible and will lead to a product.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic addition to the benzyne intermediate(s).**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (2-deuterobenzyne, from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium is at C-2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the -NH2 group is numbered C-1', so the original C-2 (with D) is now C-3'. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne, from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack by NH2⁻ can occur at either C-1 or C-2 of the triple bond, but since the molecule is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 (or C-2):** The NH2 group attaches, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated. The final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of possible organic products.**\nBy considering both the major and minor pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C6H5NH2)\n2.  2-Deuterioaniline (C6H4DNH2, with D ortho to NH2)\n3.  3-Deuterioaniline (C6H4DNH2, with D meta to NH2)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must count all chemically distinct molecules that can be formed, even those from minor pathways. Therefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
