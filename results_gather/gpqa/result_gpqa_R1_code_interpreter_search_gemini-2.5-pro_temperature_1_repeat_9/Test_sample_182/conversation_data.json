    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand the functional groups and unsaturations present.\n    *   **Core structure:** A six-membered ring (cyclohexane derivative).\n    *   **Unsaturations:**\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) attached to the ring, which contains another C=C double bond.\n        *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n        *   `carboxylic acid`: A carboxyl group (-COOH) which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **Rings:** There is one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. Its primary function is to completely reduce a wide range of functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:**\n    The reaction will act on all the functional groups and unsaturations of the starting material, but it will not break the stable six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `vinyl group` (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an `ethyl group` (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl group` (-CHO) will be reduced to a `methyl group` (-CH3).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid group` (-COOH) will be reduced to a `methyl group` (-CH3).\n\n    The final product is a saturated, substituted cycloalkane. The carbon skeleton is preserved. The initial molecule has a 6-carbon ring, a 2-carbon vinyl group, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 1-carbon carboxyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms. The product will also have 10 carbon atoms, arranged as a substituted cyclohexane. The specific name would be a derivative of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, but we don't need the exact name to find the IHD.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated by the formula:\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n    Let's analyze the structure of the product:\n    *   **Number of rings:** The original six-membered ring is not broken during the reaction. So, the product has 1 ring.\n    *   **Number of π bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has 0 π bonds.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Thus, the formula is C10H20.\n    Using the IHD formula for a molecular formula CxHy:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
