    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical process. We are dissolving solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble base, by adding a strong monobasic acid (like HCl). The acid provides H⁺ ions, which react with the hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ that dissolves, 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nWe need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)₃ are in the 0.1 g sample. To do this, we calculate its molar mass.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles = mass / Molar Mass\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n### **3. Determine the Acid's Role**\n\nThe added strong acid has two functions:\n1.  **To react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃:** This is the amount of H⁺ needed to neutralize the hydroxide and dissolve the solid. Based on the reaction stoichiometry, this is `3 * moles of Fe(OH)₃`.\n2.  **To maintain a low pH:** After the solid is dissolved, some excess H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the iron as Fe³⁺ ions and prevent it from precipitating back into Fe(OH)₃. The concentration of this excess H⁺ determines the final pH of the solution.\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added is the sum of these two parts:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ in excess)\n\n### **4. Set Up the Equilibrium Condition**\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid, which means we want to create a saturated solution where the dissolution equilibrium is just met. The equilibrium for the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThe solubility product constant expression is:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nFor the dissolution to be complete, the ion product must be equal to Ksp. The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n[Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Final Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0093575 M\n\nThe concentration of OH⁻ is related to the final H⁺ concentration ([H⁺]final) and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n[OH⁻] = Kw / [H⁺]final\n\nSubstituting these into the Ksp expression allows us to relate the final pH to the known quantities. However, the exact value of Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ can vary. A more robust method is to use the provided options to check for internal consistency.\n\n### **5. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nLet's assume one of the options is correct and check if the numbers work out. For each option, we have a proposed final pH and a volume of acid added.\n\nWe can calculate the `Total Moles H⁺` in two ways:\n1.  **From Acid Volume:** `Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration of Acid × Volume of Acid`\n2.  **From Reaction Stoichiometry and Final pH:** `Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ excess)`\n    *   `Moles H⁺ reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃`\n    *   `Moles H⁺ excess = [H⁺]final × Final Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L`\n\nA correct option must yield the same `Total Moles H⁺` from both calculations. We will use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately for all four options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # g/mol\nfinal_volume = 0.1  # L (100 cm3)\nacid_concentration = 0.1  # M\n\n# --- Moles of Fe(OH)3 and H+ for reaction ---\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\nmoles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# --- Options ---\noptions = {\n    \"A\": {\"pH\": 4.94, \"volume_cm3\": 20.40},\n    \"B\": {\"pH\": 3.16, \"volume_cm3\": 32.14},\n    \"C\": {\"pH\": 2.69, \"volume_cm3\": 30.09},\n    \"D\": {\"pH\": 2.04, \"volume_cm3\": 28.05},\n}\n\n# --- Analysis ---\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 = {moles_feoh3:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Stoichiometric moles of H+ needed for reaction = {moles_h_reacted:.6f}\\n\")\n\nfor label, values in options.items():\n    ph = values[\"pH\"]\n    volume_L = values[\"volume_cm3\"] / 1000\n\n    # 1.

Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that for Option C, the total moles of H⁺ calculated from the acid volume (`0.003009 mol`) is extremely close to the total moles of H⁺ calculated from the final pH and reaction requirements (`0.003011 mol`). The difference is negligible and can be attributed to rounding in the problem's given values. For all other options, the discrepancy is significant. Therefore, Option C is the only one that is chemically and mathematically consistent.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has provided a multiple-choice question and I have used a Python script to verify which of the options is chemically and mathematically consistent.\n\n### **Summary of Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The dissolution of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, by a strong acid (H⁺) follows the reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Moles Calculation:**\n    *   First, we calculated the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample. The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n        `Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol`\n    *   From the reaction stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n        `Moles H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × 0.000936 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol`\n\n3.  **Mass Balance for H⁺:** The total amount of H⁺ added from the acid serves two purposes:\n    *   It reacts with the Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   The excess H⁺ remains in the solution, determining the final pH.\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ can be expressed in two ways which must be equal for the correct answer:\n        1.  `Total H⁺ (from acid) = Acid Volume (L) × Acid Concentration (0.1 M)`\n        2.  `Total H⁺ (from result) = Moles H⁺ (for reaction) + Moles H⁺ (excess)`\n            where `Moles H⁺ (excess) = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × Final Volume (0.1 L)`\n\n4.  **Verification of Options:** The Python script tested each option by comparing these two methods of calculating the total H⁺ moles.\n\n    *   **For Option A (pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³):**\n        *   H⁺ from acid: `0.002040 mol`\n        *   H⁺ from result: `0.002808 mol`\n        *   Result: Inconsistent. Not enough acid is added to even dissolve the solid completely.\n\n    *   **For Option B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):**\n        *   H⁺ from acid: `0.003214 mol`\n        *   H⁺ from result: `0.002876 mol`\n        *   Result: Inconsistent.\n\n    *   **For Option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n        *   H⁺ from acid: `0.003009 mol`\n        *   H⁺ from result: `0.003011 mol`\n        *   Result: **Consistent.** The values are nearly identical, with the small difference attributable to rounding.\n\n    *   **For Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):**\n        *   H⁺ from acid: `0.002805 mol`\n        *   H⁺ from result: `0.003719 mol`\n        *   Result: Inconsistent.\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that only Option C provides a volume of acid and a resulting pH that are consistent with the chemical principles and stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
