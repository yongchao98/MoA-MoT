    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex problem—the interaction of a probe (like an electron, photon, or neutrino) with a many-body system (a nucleus)—into a much simpler one. It assumes that the interaction happens with just **one** of the constituent particles (a nucleon) inside the nucleus, and that this nucleon behaves as if it were a **free** particle during the very brief moment of interaction. The other nucleons are treated as mere \"spectators.\"\n\nNow let's analyze each statement in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the first key element of the impulse approximation. It explicitly states that the probe interacts with a single nucleon, not with the nucleus as a collective whole, nor with the messenger particles (mesons) exchanged between nucleons. This assumption allows us to isolate a single nucleon as the target. This statement is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This refers to what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) were to interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons, the simple picture would be ruined. These are known as initial-state interactions (ISI) and final-state interactions (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we are ignoring ISI and FSI. This is a crucial step in ensuring that the interaction can be treated as a clean, two-body collision (probe + one nucleon), just like scattering from a free particle. This statement is essential.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole* within the nuclear environment. Whether the quarks inside the nucleon are treated as relativistic or non-relativistic is a separate modeling choice related to nucleon form factors. The impulse approximation can be, and is, used in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks. Therefore, this assumption is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the heart of the impulse approximation and gives it its name. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid (an \"impulse\") that the struck nucleon is ejected from the nucleus before it has time to feel the binding forces from the surrounding nucleons. It behaves kinematically as a free particle, not one trapped in a nuclear potential well. This statement is essential.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo approximate the interaction as one with a free nucleon, we must assume:\n- The interaction is with only one nucleon (Statement 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere with the incoming or outgoing particles (Statement 2).\n- The selected nucleon doesn't feel its binding forces during the interaction (Statement 4).\n\nThe combination of statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describes the impulse approximation.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
