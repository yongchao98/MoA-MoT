    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a six-carbon chain.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at position C3.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position C5.\n    *   There is a single stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is (S). This stereocenter will not be altered during the reaction.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. The stereocenter is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter at this position.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The reaction creates a mixture of two products. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the two products are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers**. They have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements at one (but not all) stereocenters. Diastereomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with a five-carbon chain.\n    *   The carbonyl groups are at positions C2 and C4.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry and no stereocenters.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   With two stereocenters, there is a maximum of 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. We need to examine their relationships.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral)\n    *   The two enantiomers are formed as a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. It can, however, separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **Total Compounds:** We have a mixture of 5 compounds in total (2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II).\n    *   **From Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and have different polarities. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it has a different polarity and will be separated from them, giving a second peak.\n        *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   **Overall:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = (Peaks from I) + (Peaks from II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. In essence, it can separate all stereochemically unique molecules.\n*   **Total Compounds:** We have 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral)\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will resolve all 5 distinct compounds.\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   P3 and P4 are enantiomers and will be separated by the chiral column.\n    *   P5 is a diastereomer of P3/P4 and will be separated from them.\n    *   The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II, so they will all have unique retention times.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks**, one for each unique compound in the mixture.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
