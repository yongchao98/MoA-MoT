    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium:**\n    The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (represented as Y^4- assuming ideal pH where it's fully deprotonated). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   Formation: Ca^2+ + Y^4- <=> [CaY]^2-\n    *   Dissociation: [CaY]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:**\n    The problem gives the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex.\n    K_f = [[CaY]^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [Y^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) would be the inverse of K_f, but it's easier to work directly with the given K_f value.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, [CaY]^2-. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates to reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, 'x' will also be the concentration of the free Ca^2+ and Y^4- ions formed.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]^2-        | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y^4-            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10), the equilibrium lies far to the left (favoring the complex). This means the amount of dissociation, x, will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    Therefore, we can make the approximation: (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for x, which represents [Ca^2+]:\n    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\n    x = √(4 x 10^-13)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n6.  **Verify the approximation:**\n    The calculated value for x (6.32 x 10^-7 M) is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so the approximation was valid.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n    A) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, the following Python code can be used.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex in M\nC_complex_initial = 0.02\n\n# Formation constant (K_f)\nK_f = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (C_complex - x) / x^2\n# Using the approximation that x is very small, K_f ≈ C_complex / x^2\n# We solve for x, where x = [Ca^2+]\n# x^2 ≈ C_complex / K_f\nx_squared = C_complex_initial / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation with one decimal place\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.3e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe code output is 6.3e-07, which is 6.3 x 10^-7 M. This confirms the manual calculation and matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY]^2-, at an initial stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M. The complex dissociates slightly into its constituent ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (Y^4-). We need to find the equilibrium concentration of the free calcium ions.\n\n1.  **The Dissociation Equilibrium:**\n    The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n    [CaY]^2-  ⇌  Ca^2+  +  Y^4-\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Constant:**\n    The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which corresponds to the reverse reaction (Ca^2+ + Y^4- ⇌ [CaY]^2-).\n    K_f = [ [CaY]^2- ] / ( [Ca^2+] * [Y^4-] ) = 5 x 10^10\n\n3.  **Setting up the ICE Table:**\n    We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex [CaY]^2- will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]^2-        | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y^4-            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n5.  **Simplifying and Solving for x:**\n    Because the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10), the equilibrium heavily favors the formation of the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, and 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\n    Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    x = √(4 x 10^-13)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is equal to x.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. This matches option A. The Python code execution in the previous step confirmed this calculation, yielding 6.3e-07.\n\n<<<A>>>"
