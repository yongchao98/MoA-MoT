    "This problem requires finding the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. General Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-dependent charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')`, the scalar potential `V(r, t)` and vector potential `A(r, t)` at a field point `r` and time `t` are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `t_r` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that a signal emitted from `r'` at `t_r` reaches `r` at time `t`, traveling at the speed of light `c`:\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Potentials for a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = d s(t') / dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c`. The argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'` not just directly, but also through `t_r`. This makes the integral non-trivial.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nA standard result from electromagnetism for evaluating this integral is that the retardation effect modifies the effective charge. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nwhere all quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t_r)` is the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{v}` is the velocity of the charge at `tr`.\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|` is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d` is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n\nUsing this result, the integrals for the potentials become:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript `t_r` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr` which is determined by the implicit equation `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the denominators to match the form given in the options:\nThe denominator term is $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d - d(\\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\nDenominator: $dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\nNumerator for V: `qc`\nNumerator for A: `qcv`\n\nSo, the potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q c \\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's check the expression for `A` again. The `μ_o` term needs to be there.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option D.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These use the static potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the crucial effects of retardation and the velocity's influence on the potential's magnitude.\n*   **Option C:** This option has the correct form but the wrong sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`). A positive sign would imply that a charge moving towards the observer produces a weaker potential, which contradicts the physics of the Doppler effect. The minus sign is correct, indicating that the potential is enhanced when the source is moving towards the observer (`\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0`).\n*   **Option D:** This option has the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, with the correct denominator `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})`.\n\nAdditionally, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials satisfy the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Let's check this for option D:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o\\epsilon_o)$, we get $1/\\epsilon_o = \\mu_o c^2$.\n$\\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} (\\mu_o c^2)}{4\\pi c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}$\nThe relation holds, confirming the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
