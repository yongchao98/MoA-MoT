    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the System and its States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\nLet's list all 8 possible states as (S1, S2, S3):\n1.  ( +1, +1, +1 )\n2.  ( +1, +1, -1 )\n3.  ( +1, -1, +1 )\n4.  ( -1, +1, +1 )\n5.  ( +1, -1, -1 )\n6.  ( -1, +1, -1 )\n7.  ( -1, -1, +1 )\n8.  ( -1, -1, -1 )\n\n**2. Define the Energy of the System**\nThe energy of a given configuration is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\nwhere J is the coupling constant.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i e^(-β*E_i)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 states. It's helpful to group states with the same energy level (degenerate states).\n\n*   **Group 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   State 1: (+1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   State 8: (-1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   There are **2** states with energy **E₁ = -3J**.\n\n*   **Group 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    This group includes states with two spins up and one down, and states with one spin up and two down.\n    *   State 2: (+1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 3: (+1, -1, +1)\n        E = -J [ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 4: (-1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J [ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 5: (+1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J [ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 6: (-1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J [ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   State 7: (-1, -1, +1)\n        E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   There are **6** states with energy **E₂ = +J**.\n\n**5. Sum the Contributions to the Partition Function**\nThe partition function Z can be calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by their degeneracy (the number of states at that energy level).\nZ = (Number of states with energy E₁) * e^(-β*E₁) + (Number of states with energy E₂) * e^(-β*E₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β*(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β*(+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\nLet's check the options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
