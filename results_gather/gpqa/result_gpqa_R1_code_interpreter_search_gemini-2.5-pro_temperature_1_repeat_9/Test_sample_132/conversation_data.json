    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial concentrations.**\n    The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4·2H2O) in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the relevant equilibria and calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n    We have a buffer solution containing a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). The pH of this buffer is determined by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\n    *   Equilibrium 1: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n\n    We can calculate the [H+] using the expression for Ka2:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.114 x 10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This equilibrium is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3.\n    *   Equilibrium 2: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\n    We can calculate [PO4^3-] using the expression for Ka3. The [H+] is the value we just calculated for the buffer solution, and we can assume the concentration of [HPO4^2-] is its initial concentration because its dissociation is very small.\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.114 x 10^-8 M)\n    [PO4^3-] = 6.23 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo perform the calculation more accurately without intermediate rounding, we can use a script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L (200.00 cm^3)\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume\n\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\nH_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the initial components and their roles:**\n*   The solution contains KH₂PO₄, which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), a weak acid.\n*   The solution also contains Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   These two species form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; pKa₂\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each salt.\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, we calculate the molar concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ ([H₂PO₄⁻]) = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ ([HPO₄²⁻]) = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer:**\nThe hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the buffer equilibrium, governed by Ka₂.\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.114 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻):**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by Ka₃.\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]. We use the [H⁺] we just calculated for the buffer and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since its dissociation is negligible).\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.114 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirms this result:\n`6.236e-07` is equivalent to 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M is closest to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
