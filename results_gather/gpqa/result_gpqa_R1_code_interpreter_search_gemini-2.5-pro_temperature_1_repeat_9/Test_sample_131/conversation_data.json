    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given spectral data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals (singlets) around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates that there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound**\n\nAll four candidate compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C4, and C5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a singlet integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce one singlet integrating to 6H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent by symmetry. They will produce a second, distinct singlet integrating to 6H.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (6H each)\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way the others do.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen) are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals, two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, C5) are in unique chemical environments. We would expect four distinct singlets, each integrating to 3H. (Note: Sometimes, accidental overlap can reduce the number of observed signals, but based on pure symmetry, we expect four).\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1H each)\n        *   Aliphatic: 4 singlets (3H each)\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite (para) positions.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The ethyl group (-CH2CH3) would show characteristic coupling. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3 protons would be a triplet. The problem states that all signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option A.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options based on a 1:1 mixture**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in the remaining options.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three** singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three** singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Since these are different compounds, their aromatic signals will likely have different chemical shifts. As the mixture is 1:1, we will see **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H, giving an integral ratio of **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming no accidental overlap). The integral ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces a combined 1H NMR spectrum matching the description is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
