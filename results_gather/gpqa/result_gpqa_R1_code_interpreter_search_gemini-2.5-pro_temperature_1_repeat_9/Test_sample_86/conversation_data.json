    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Structural Information:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Information:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This tells us one of the substituents on the benzene ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbons is 8. Therefore, the substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   This means the other substituent must contain both of the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable C2-substituent containing a carbonyl group is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: An acetyl group has 2 carbons and one C=O. This is a perfect fit.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone: X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   There are three possible positional isomers: ortho, meta, and para.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely isomer:**\n    *   The 1H NMR options provided show simple splitting patterns (doublets), which are characteristic of a highly symmetric substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The para- (1,4-) substitution pattern is the most symmetric.\n    *   Let's predict the spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-disubstituted ring, due to symmetry, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This typically results in a pattern known as an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct doublets. Each doublet would integrate to 2 protons. The chemical shift for these protons is usually in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen. So, we expect to see something like `~7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.6 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three equivalent methyl protons. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon next to a carbonyl group (an alpha-keto methyl group) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** `~7.8 (2H, d)`, `~7.6 (2H, d)`, `~2.3 (3H, s)`.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: Incorrect. Lacks the signals for aromatic protons in the 7-8 ppm range.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and integrations are suspect.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. An aldehyde-containing structure consistent with the C8 count (like (halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO) would show coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet), not two singlets.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match with our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Represents the four protons on the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: Represents the three protons of the methyl group in the acetyl substituent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D correctly describes it.\n\n<<<D>>>"
