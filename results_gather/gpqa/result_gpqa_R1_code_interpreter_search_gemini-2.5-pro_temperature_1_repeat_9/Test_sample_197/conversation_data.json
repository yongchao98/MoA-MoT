    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This percentage is also known as the mole fraction (α) of that species, multiplied by 100.\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    The cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free metal ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βn).\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n3.  **Formulate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    The mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, α₂, is the concentration of that complex divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co), we get:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for [Co(SCN)₂] and c(Co) into the formula for α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Calculate the value of α₂:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the ligand concentration is 10 times the metal concentration, we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration).\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    We can now calculate each term in the equation for α₂. The calculation can be done efficiently using code.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = b1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = b2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = b3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = b4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n```output\npercentage=16.91617947171485\n```\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is given by the formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWhere:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term 0: 1\n*   Term 1: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (Numerator): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the terms for the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches the provided code output.\n\n<<<C>>>"
