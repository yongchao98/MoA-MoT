    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is considered the \"stationary\" frame for our calculation.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames (v) is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame, S') is Δt₀ = 50 s. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance 'd'.\n    *   The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where Δt is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (Δt) for events happening in a moving frame (S') than an observer in the moving frame measures (Δt₀). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the distance formula with the time calculated for the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the steps into a single formula:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n`d = 60,000 * 50 / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option C.\n\nI will use a python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # proper time in seconds\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<execute_code>\n3061862.178478448\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862.18 km.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for solving this special relativity problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Frame S (Galaxy's Frame):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Frame S' (Ejecta's Frame):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It's called proper time because it's measured by a clock at rest in its own reference frame.\n    *   **Speed of light (c):** The constant speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving frame (S'). This effect is called **time dilation**.\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`).\n    *   The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Once we find the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance `d` using the classical formula, as the distance, velocity, and time are all measured in the same frame (S):\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n            `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   Next, square this ratio:\n            `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n        *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n            `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n            `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   Using the time dilation formula:\n            `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n            `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n        *   This means that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   Using the distance formula with the dilated time:\n            `d = v * Δt`\n            `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   This value is closest to option C) 3,060,000 km.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation precisely.
