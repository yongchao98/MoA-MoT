    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X) from the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad absorption is the hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that has formed a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a carbonyl peak at these specific frequencies strongly indicates that Compound X is a carboxylic acid containing an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and described as a broad singlet (bs) is definitively the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which means these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is our carboxylic acid (-COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm represents the two protons adjacent to the other substituent.\n    *   **Analyzing the Alkyl Substituent (the remaining signals):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂-CH₃`).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is being split by both the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine proton (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. Its chemical shift (around 3 ppm) suggests it is a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). It is a multiplet because it is being split by the protons on its adjacent carbons.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the para (1 and 4) positions.\n        2.  One substituent is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        3.  Let's assemble the other substituent, the alkyl group. The benzylic proton (2.9 ppm) is a -CH-. This -CH- is attached to a methyl group (1.4 ppm, doublet) and an ethyl group (represented by the 1.7 ppm -CH₂- and 0.9 ppm -CH₃ signals).\n        4.  This forms a `CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        5.  Therefore, the full structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagent systems capable of completely reducing a carboxylic acid functional group all the way down to an alkane.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group is an alkyl chain and is already fully reduced, so it will not be affected by the reagents.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product to the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n\nOur deduced final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which corresponds exactly to option A. Option D is the starting material, Compound X.\n\n<<<A>>>"
