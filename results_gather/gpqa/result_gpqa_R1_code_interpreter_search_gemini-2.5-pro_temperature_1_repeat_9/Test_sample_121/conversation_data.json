    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, using Br2 with a base like pyridine can also achieve α-bromination. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) has one α-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens.\n    *   CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (α-Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH3CH2OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group.\n    *   Br-CH2-COOH → Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3). The two protons on the α-carbon (the CH2 group between the CN and COOEt groups) are acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) is a dialkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This reaction is an analogue of the malonic ester synthesis used to form cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **First deprotonation:** NaH removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`\n    2.  **First alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`\n    3.  **Second deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it removes the second, now only, acidic α-proton.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]`\n    4.  **Intramolecular alkylation:** The carbanion at the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a highly favorable process (Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      EtOOC --C-- CN\n             / \\\n         (2)CH2-CH2(6)\n            |   |\n         (3)CH2-CH2(5)\n             \\ /\n            (4)CH2\n```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, the substituents on C1, and C4. This plane makes the right side of the ring (C2, C3) equivalent to the left side (C6, C5).\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This is **Signal 1**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are equivalent to each other but distinct from the methyl protons. This is **Signal 2**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** In a substituted cyclohexane, protons on the same methylene (CH2) group are typically non-equivalent (diastereotopic) unless a specific symmetry element makes them equivalent.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic. Thus, the two protons on C2 are non-equivalent, and they correspond to the two non-equivalent protons on C6. This gives **Signal 3** and **Signal 4**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and are in a different environment from the C2/C6 protons. This gives **Signal 5** and **Signal 6**.\n        *   **C4:** This carbon is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons attached to C4 are also diastereotopic. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule. This gives **Signal 7** and **Signal 8**.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n    *   C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n    *   C4 position: 2 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nTherefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4 will show 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
