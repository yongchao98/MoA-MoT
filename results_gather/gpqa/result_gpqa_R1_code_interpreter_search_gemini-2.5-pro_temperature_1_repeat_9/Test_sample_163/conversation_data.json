    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. Let's call this ratio `R = M_sys1 / M_sys2`.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physics Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, we can relate the total mass of the system (M = m1 + m2) to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n    M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n    Where:\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Apply Simplifications:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This means their orbital planes are almost perfectly edge-on to our line of sight. Therefore, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and `sin(i)` is very close to 1. We can approximate `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   The term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is a constant. Since we are calculating a ratio of masses, this constant will cancel out.\n\n5.  **Establish Proportionality:** Based on the formula and simplifications, the total mass of a system (M_total) is directly proportional to its period (P) and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes (K_a + K_b):\n    M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³\n\n6.  **Set Up the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 as:\n    R = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\n7.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   For system_1: P1 = 2 years, (K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system_2: P2 = 1 year, (K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s.\n\n    Now, we plug these into the ratio formula. Note that the units (years and km/s) are consistent between the numerator and denominator, so they will cancel out, and no conversion is necessary.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1   # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nV_sum1 = K1a + K1b\nV_sum2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (V_sum)^3\n# We calculate the ratio of the masses\n# The proportionality constant cancels out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (V_sum1)**3) / (P2 * (V_sum2)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n8.  **Final Result:** The calculation yields a ratio of 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 0.4\n    C) ~ 0.6\n    D) ~ 1.2\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that is also eclipsing, the total mass of the system (M_total = M₁ + M₂) can be found using Kepler's Third Law. The relevant formula is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2πG * sin³i)\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n**2. Simplify the Formula**\n\n*   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` is approximately 90°. Therefore, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n*   **Ratio Calculation:** We are asked for a ratio of masses. When we set up the ratio (M_sys1 / M_sys2), the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will cancel out.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the masses of the two systems as:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n**4. Plug in the Values**\n\nLet's substitute the given values for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P₁ = 2 years\n    *   K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P₂ = 1 year\n    *   K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) ~ 0.7\n*   B) ~ 0.4\n*   C) ~ 0.6\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
