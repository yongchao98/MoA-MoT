    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key is to control the regiochemistry of the electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions to place the groups in this specific arrangement.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Substituent Effects**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. Due to its large size, it often favors para substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA good strategy is to think about the last step first.\n*   The **ethoxy group** is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenol with an alkyl halide). This means the precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Step (Final):** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH, then EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n*   How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **Step (Penultimate):** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl; 2. H3O+/heat)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**? This requires introducing a nitro group onto **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   Let's analyze the directing effects for the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group (at C1) is a strong o,p-director, and the -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director. They would direct an incoming electrophile to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   **The Trick:** However, if the nitration is carried out in strong acid (like H2SO4), the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a **meta-director**.\n        *   On the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n        *   The -tBu group at C2 directs ortho/para (to C4 and C6).\n        *   The strong meta-directing effect of the -NH3+ group can force a significant amount of the nitro group to substitute at the C3 position. This is the key step to achieve the 1,2,3-pattern.\n    *   **Step (Antepenultimate):** 2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butylaniline**? This can be made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, **2-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Step:** 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl or H2/Pd)--> 2-tert-butylaniline.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butylnitrobenzene**? We can nitrate tert-butylbenzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride gives tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products. The para isomer (4-tert-butylnitrobenzene) is the major product due to sterics, but the ortho isomer (2-tert-butylnitrobenzene) is also formed and can be separated. The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a bit problematic here, but this is a viable route. (A true high-yield route would use a blocking group strategy, but that sequence is more complex than the options provided).\n    *   **Step (First):** Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)--> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   **Step (Second):** tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene (minor product) + 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\n\n**4. Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's assemble the full sequence based on our analysis:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene (with tBuCl/AlCl3)\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene (requires separation from para isomer)\n3.  **Reduction:** 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene -> 2-tert-butylaniline (with Fe/HCl)\n4.  **Nitration:** 2-tert-butylaniline -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (with HNO3/H2SO4, exploiting meta-direction of anilinium ion)\n5.  **Diazotization:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline -> Diazonium salt (with NaNO2/HCl)\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** Diazonium salt -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (with H3O+/heat)\n7.  **Etherification:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (with NaOH/EtBr)\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A)** Starts with nitration of benzene, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on the deactivated aniline product is problematic/fails. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**; **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**; **iii) Fe/HCl**; **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**; **v) NaNO2/HCl**; **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**; **vii) NaOH/EtBr**... This sequence perfectly matches the 7 steps derived above. The final two steps listed (viii and ix) seem to be extraneous and incorrect additions, likely a typo in the question, as they would involve sulfonating and then desulfonating the final product for no reason.\n*   **C)** The sequence of reactions is illogical and does not lead to the target. For example, it sulfonates after nitration, which doesn't help achieve the target regiochemistry.\n*   **D)** This option attempts a blocking group strategy but performs the steps in the wrong order. For example, it reduces the nitro group (step iv) before removing the sulfonic acid group, and then attempts another nitration (step vi) on a diazonium salt, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the issues with the \"high-yield\" claim and the extraneous steps at the end, the sequence of chemical transformations in **Option B (steps i-vii)** is the only one that represents a chemically valid and logical pathway to synthesize the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
