    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp3 hybridized carbon.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: A six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone groups (=O) at opposite positions (para).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons are part of a C=C double bond (sp2 hybridized). They do have hydrogen atoms, but these are vinylic hydrogens, not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   Attempting to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system of the ring, leading to a very unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: A saturated six-membered ring (all sp3 carbons except for the carbonyl carbons) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens).\n        *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to easily undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, C2 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (trans-isomer)\n        *   This molecule is planar around the double bond. It does not have any chiral centers (no carbon with four different groups).\n        *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, which are elements of symmetry that make a molecule achiral. An achiral molecule cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
