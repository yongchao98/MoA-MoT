    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes planes of symmetry (Ïƒ) and centers of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All four atoms connected to the C=C double bond lie in the same plane.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   When a compound is named with specific R/S descriptors, it refers to a single stereoisomer. Unless this specific stereoisomer happens to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters), it will be chiral.\n    *   The parent structure might have some symmetry, but the substituents, especially the `=(E)-CHCl` group on the methano-bridge, make the overall molecule asymmetric. It does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this specific enantiomer is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH).\n    *   The (2R,3S) configuration indicates that the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the (R,S) or (S,R) form is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has a plane of symmetry (when in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (when in a staggered, anti-periplanar conformation). Due to this internal symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configuration is (2R,3R).\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active. (It would be found as one of a pair of enantiomers).\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH=CH-CH2-` path around the ring. Since these two paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors (1s,3s,5s) indicate that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all *cis*).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three -OH groups pointing \"up\". This molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3). More importantly, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the C-H group on the opposite carbon (e.g., a plane through C1 and C4).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** (it's a meso compound). Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone where the carbonyl group is flanked by a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group.\n    *   The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon attached to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is **achiral**. It is not optically active.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
