    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (`C6H5-X`). The substituent `X` determines where the incoming bromine atom will attach (ortho, meta, or para position). The question asks to arrange the given substances in order of *increasing* yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\nThe weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the product mixture, as all monobrominated products (ortho, meta, para) are isomers and have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to arrange the substances based on the increasing percentage of para-substitution.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect on electrophilic substitution.\n\n*   **Substances:**\n    1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): `-CH3` is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n    2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` is an ester group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n    3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` is a halogen. It is **deactivating, but ortho, para-director**.\n    4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` is a nitro group. It is a strongly **deactivating, meta-director**.\n    5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n    6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` is a carboxylic acid group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Separate into Two Groups\nBased on the directing effects, we can split the substances into two groups:\n*   **Group M (Meta-directors):** These will produce very little para-isomer. The primary product is the meta-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Group OP (Ortho, Para-directors):** These will produce significant amounts of ortho and para-isomers, with very little meta-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nLogically, the substances in Group M will have much lower para-isomer yields than the substances in Group OP. So the final ordered list will look like: `{Group M members} < {Group OP members}`.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Meta-Directors (Group M)\nThe substances are (4) `-NO2`, (6) `-COOH`, and (2) `-COOC2H5`.\nAll three are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low for all of them.\nThe strength of the deactivating effect determines how strongly meta-directing the group is. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and, consequently, a lower percentage of the ortho and para-isomers.\nThe order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n`C6H5-NO2` < `C6H5-COOH` < `C6H5-COOC2H5`\nIn terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*Typical para yields: Nitrobenzene (~0.7%), Benzoic acid (~2%), Ethyl benzoate (~5%).*\n\n### Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group OP)\nThe substances are (1) `-CH3`, (5) `-C2H5`, and (3) `-Cl`.\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The exact percentage depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, making substitution at the para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene should give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: `CH3 < C2H5` or **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is deactivating via a strong inductive effect, but it directs ortho, para via resonance. The inductive withdrawal of electrons is felt most strongly at the ortho position, which disfavors ortho substitution compared to para substitution. This electronic effect leads to a very high para/ortho ratio for halobenzenes.\n    *   Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-Cl` (3): The para yield for chlorobenzene (~87%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%). So, **1 < 3**.\n    *   Comparing `-C2H5` (5) and `-Cl` (3): This involves comparing the steric effect of the ethyl group versus the electronic effect of the chloro group. The electronic effect of the halogen is very effective at favoring the para position. The question's options suggest an order where the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest among these three. This implies that the electronic effect of `-Cl` is more significant in promoting para substitution than the steric effect of `-C2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the plausible order of increasing para yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Orders\nNow, we combine the order of the two groups:\n*   Group M order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Group OP order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
