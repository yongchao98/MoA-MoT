    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and how the resulting mixture of products would be analyzed by different types of chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, the resulting epoxide is also *trans*.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition. A water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond, causing an inversion of configuration at the center that is attacked.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides.\n    *   For the (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 (inverting it to S) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inverting it to S) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is a *meso* compound.\n    *   The same *meso* compound is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a single product: the *meso*-compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA useful mnemonic for dihydroxylation reactions is that **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso product.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric, epoxidation from either face yields the same single product: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide is a *meso* compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The *anti*-addition (ring-opening) of the *meso*-epoxide is next.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is, say, R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reagent and an achiral (meso) intermediate, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nAnother useful mnemonic is that **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The *meso* compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three stereoisomers is run on two different HPLC columns.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical and chemical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and be separated. The *meso* compound will separate from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, and one for the unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The *meso* compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, eluting as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
