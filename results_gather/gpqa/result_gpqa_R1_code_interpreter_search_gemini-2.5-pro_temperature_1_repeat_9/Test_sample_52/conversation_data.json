    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a `C6H4` core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (`C=O`) bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`-C6H4-`). Two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggest a para-substitution pattern (1,4-disubstituted), where the protons are split into two groups of two, each appearing as a doublet (an AA'BB' system).\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a `C=C` double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to a group with no adjacent protons (like our aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the `-CH3` group (into a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   Proton `H(a)` is split only by `H(b)` (into a **doublet**).\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has the formula `C3H5` and contains one of the two methyl groups.\n        *   **Two -CH3 group signals:** We have identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second `-CH3` signal must belong to the ester group. This means the ester is either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`).\n        *   **No -CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (`-CH2-`) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group: `C3H5` (which contains two vinyl protons and one methyl group)\n    *   An ester functionality which must also contain the second methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n        *   An acetoxy group: `-OCOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments regardless of which type of ester it is.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `C3H5` propenyl group) + 2 (from `C2H3O2` ester/methyl part) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from `C3H5` propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's `CH3` group) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2: Incorrect. This would require an additional `CH2` group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect. This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived formula. This would imply the absence of the `C=C` double bond in the propenyl group (i.e., it would be a propyl group), contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect. This formula has an extra carbon compared to our derived structure. It is not possible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula to something else) or violating the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n    *   D) C11H12O2: Correct. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from the spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The detailed analysis of the FTIR and especially the 1H NMR data allows for the unambiguous assembly of the molecular fragments into a structure whose formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
