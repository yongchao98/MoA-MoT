    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactant\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide. The `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` part indicates a cyclohexane ring (6 carbons) with an oxygen bridge (O at position 7) between C1 and C6, forming an epoxide. The fusion is necessarily *cis*.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nTo correctly analyze the reaction, we must draw the most stable chair conformation of the reactant.\n*   Let's draw a cyclohexane chair and place the *cis*-fused epoxide \"up\" (β-face).\n*   For the epoxide to be fused between C1 and C6, one C-O bond will be axial and one will be equatorial. Let's place C1 such that its bond to the epoxide oxygen is axial (up) and C6 such that its bond to the oxygen is equatorial (up).\n*   Now we place the substituents and verify the R/S configuration:\n    *   **At C1:** The C-O bond is axial (up). To satisfy (1R), the methyl group must be equatorial (down/out).\n    *   **At C6:** The C-O bond is equatorial (up). To satisfy (6S), the implicit hydrogen must be axial (down).\n    *   **At C3:** To satisfy (3R), the methyl group must be equatorial (up).\n    *   **At C4:** To satisfy (4R), the methyl group must be equatorial (down/out).\n\nThis gives us the most stable conformation of the starting material, with all three methyl groups in equatorial positions.\n\n**Reactant Summary (Chair Conformation):**\n*   Epoxide is \"up\".\n*   C1-O is axial (up).\n*   C6-O is equatorial (up).\n*   C1-Me is equatorial.\n*   C3-Me is equatorial.\n*   C4-Me is equatorial.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n        *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n        *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n        *   Therefore, the attack occurs at **C6**.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2-type mechanism**. For cyclohexene oxides, this follows the **Fürst-Plattner rule (trans-diaxial opening)**. The nucleophile attacks axially on one carbon, and the C-O bond breaks, positioning the resulting -OH group axially on the adjacent carbon.\n\n### 3. Predict the Product\n*   **Attack:** The Me⁻ nucleophile must attack C6 from an axial direction. The axial position at C6 is on the bottom face (α-face), opposite the epoxide.\n*   **Ring Opening:** The axial attack by Me⁻ at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide. The C1-O bond was originally axial (up), so the resulting -OH group (after workup) will be axial (up).\n*   **Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The new methyl group from the reagent is added at C6 in an **axial** position.\n    *   The hydroxyl group at C1 is in an **axial** position.\n    *   The original three methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 were not involved in the reaction and remain in their original **equatorial** positions.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's Name\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon bearing the -OH group is now C1. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The original C6 is now C2. This gives the locant set 1,2,4,5 for the four methyl groups. The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine the R/S configuration for the final product, which has an axial -OH at C1, an axial -Me at C2, an equatorial -Me at C1, an equatorial -Me at C4, and an equatorial -Me at C5.\n    *   **At C1:** The configuration is **(R)**. (Original C1 was R, and while the group changed from -O-epoxide to -OH, the priorities do not reorder in a way that flips the R/S designation).\n    *   **At C2 (old C6):** The attack causes inversion of configuration. The reactant was (6S). Therefore, the product at this center will be **(R)**.\n    *   **At C4 (old C4):** This stereocenter was not involved in the reaction. The reactant was (4R). The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **At C5 (old C3):** This stereocenter was not involved in the reaction. The reactant was (3R). The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product Name:** Combining these results, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
