    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong absorption peak in the 1680-1725 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   No vinyl-hydrogens: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This signal corresponds to a proton (let's call it H_A) that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   A set of three neighboring protons (n=3), giving a quartet (n+1=4).\n    This implies H_A is a methine proton (`-CH-`) adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This signal corresponds to a different proton (H_B) that is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), giving another triplet (n+1=3).\n    This implies H_B is a methine proton (`-CH-`) adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name and predict the splitting patterns for the methine (`CH`) protons in each option. The line formulas can be ambiguous, so we will deduce the most likely structure and its IUPAC name.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n` (CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1) `\n*   Proton at C3 (`-CH-`): Neighbors are `CH₂` at C2 (2H), `CH₃` on C3 (3H), and `CH` at C4 (1H). This proton would show a **`t` `q` `d`** (triplet of quartets of doublets), which is equivalent to a **`dtq`**.\n*   Proton at C4 (`-CH-`): Neighbors are `CH` at C3 (1H) and two `CH₃` groups at C4 (6H). This proton would show a `d` `sept` (doublet of septets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n` CH₃CH₂(5,4)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(2)(C₂H₅)-COOH(1) `\n*   Proton at C3 (`-CH-`): Neighbors are `CH` at C2 (1H), `CH₂` at C4 (2H), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This proton would show a `d` `t` `t` (doublet of triplets of triplets), or a **`dtt`**.\n*   Proton at C2 (`-CH-`): Neighbors are `CH` at C3 (1H) and the `CH₂` of the ethyl group on C2 (2H). This proton would show a `d` `t` (doublet of triplets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n` CH₃CH₂(5,4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1) `\n*   Proton at C3 (`-CH-`): Neighbors are `CH` at C2 (1H), `CH₃` on C3 (3H), and `CH₂` at C4 (2H). This proton would show a `d` `q` `t` (doublet of quartets of triplets), which is equivalent to a **`dtq`**.\n*   Proton at C2 (`-CH-`): Neighbors are `CH` at C3 (1H) and `CH₃` on C2 (3H). This proton would show a `d` `q` (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-Ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\nThe most plausible structure for this formula, which maximizes the main chain length, is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.\n` CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1) `\nLet's analyze the key methine protons:\n*   **Proton at C3 (`-CH-`)**: Its neighbors are:\n    *   The `CH₂` group at C2 (2H) → gives a triplet (`t`).\n    *   The `CH` group at C4 (1H) → gives a doublet (`d`).\n    *   The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → gives a triplet (`t`).\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets).\n*   **Proton at C4 (`-CH-`)**: Its neighbors are:\n    *   The `CH` group at C3 (1H) → gives a doublet (`d`).\n    *   The `CH₂` group at C5 (2H) → gives a triplet (`t`).\n    *   The `CH₃` group of the methyl substituent on C4 (3H) → gives a quartet (`q`).\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a proton at C3 that gives a `dtt` signal and a different proton at C4 that gives a `dtq` signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n### Final Identification\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only the structure corresponding to option D, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets in its spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
