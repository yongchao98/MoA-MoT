    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the functional groups mentioned and determine their priority according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' as a substituent.\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy' as a substituent.\n*   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nThe IUPAC priority order for these groups is:\n1.  **Carboxylic acid**\n2.  Nitrile (Cyano)\n3.  Aldehyde (Formyl)\n4.  Alcohol (Hydroxy)\n5.  Amine (Dimethylamino)\n6.  Ether (Methoxy)\n\nSince the carboxylic acid has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure\n\nNow, we place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n1.  **-COOH is at C1.**\n2.  The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** to one another. Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5.\n3.  A **hydroxyl (-OH)** group and a **dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂)** group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6.\n4.  A **methoxy (-OCH₃)** group is **para** to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n\n5.  We use the final piece of information to resolve the ambiguities: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group must be ortho to both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The ortho positions to the methoxy group at C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our earlier finding.\n    *   So, the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test these two possibilities:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3:** Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works. If -OH is at C2, then -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C6, and -CHO must be at C5.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5:** Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works. If -OH is at C6, then -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C2, and -CHO must be at C3.\n\nThis gives us two possible structures.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -CN at C3):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CN at C5):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. The -COOH group is fixed at C1.\n\n*   For **Structure 1**, the locants are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   For **Structure 2**, the locants are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nSince both numbering schemes result in the same set of locants {2,3,4,5,6}, we must apply the next rule: give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**.\n\n*   In **Structure 1**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In **Structure 2**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we list the substituents alphabetically and attach their corresponding locants.\n\n*   Structure 1 positions:\n    *   C3: Cyano\n    *   C6: Dimethylamino\n    *   C5: Formyl\n    *   C2: Hydroxy\n    *   C4: Methoxy\n\n*   Assembling the name in alphabetical order:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and order)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct numbering and alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
