    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system as observed from a stationary frame.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$): $2m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$): $0.6c$ in the positive x-direction.\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$): $3m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$): $0.5c$ in the positive x-direction.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nSince the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n$v_1 = 0.6c$\n$v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo get a decimal value, we calculate 1/7:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**Calculate the energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   $m_1 = 2m$\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 ($\\gamma_1$):\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   $m_2 = 3m$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo get a numerical value, we use the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option B.\nA) $v_{rel}=0.14c, E=5mc^2$\nB) $v_{rel} = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2$\nC) $v_{rel} = 1.1c , E= mc^2$\nD) $v_{rel} =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2$\n\n<<<B>>>"
