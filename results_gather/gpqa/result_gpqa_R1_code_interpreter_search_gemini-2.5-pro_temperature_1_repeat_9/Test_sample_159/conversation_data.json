    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape:** The problem describes an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides approaches the shape of a circle.\n\n2.  **Determine the Radius of the Circle:** The problem states that all apothems of the polygon have a length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N → ∞, the distinction between the apothem (inradius) and the distance from the center to a vertex (circumradius) vanishes. Therefore, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the resulting circular aperture. Let's denote the radius as R, so R = a.\n\n3.  **Identify the Diffraction Phenomenon:** When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a characteristic diffraction pattern in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction). This pattern is known as the Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n4.  **Locate the Minima (Dark Rings):** The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern is described by the square of a Bessel function. The angular positions of the minima (the dark rings) correspond to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by:\n    sin(θ) = (j_{1,m} * λ) / (π * D)\n    where:\n    *   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n    *   j_{1,m} are the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function (m = 1, 2, 3, ... for the first, second, third minimum, etc.).\n\n5.  **Adapt the Formula:** We know the radius R = a, so the diameter is D = 2R = 2a. The formula can be rewritten in terms of the radius:\n    sin(θ) = (j_{1,m} * λ) / (2π * R)\n    Using the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ) as stated in the problem, and substituting R = a, we get:\n    θ_m = (j_{1,m} * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n6.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:** We need the first two zeros of J₁(x) to find the positions of the first two minima. These are well-known values:\n    *   First zero (for the first minimum, m=1): j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero (for the second minimum, m=2): j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Positions:**\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\n        θ₁ = (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\n        θ₂ = (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]\n    Δθ = (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Coefficient:** We can now calculate the numerical coefficient.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nj1_first_zero = 3.8317\nj1_second_zero = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance is Delta_theta = (j1_second_zero - j1_first_zero) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (j1_second_zero - j1_first_zero) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\nThe python code calculates the coefficient `(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)`, which gives approximately 0.5068.\n\nThis result means the angular distance is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a).\n\n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    A) 0.506 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ /a\n    C) 0.610 λ / a\n    D) 0.500 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with N approaching infinity becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of this polygon becomes the radius of the circle. So, we are dealing with Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius R = a.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = m_z * λ / d\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   d is the diameter of the aperture, which is d = 2R = 2a.\n*   m_z represents the zeros of the first-order Bessel function J₁(x), but scaled. The more fundamental relation is:\n    k * R * sin(θ) = z_m\n    where k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber, and z_m are the zeros of J₁(x). This gives:\n    (2π/λ) * a * sin(θ) = z_m\n    sin(θ) = z_m * λ / (2π * a)\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.\nθ_m = z_m * λ / (2π * a)\n\nHere, z_m refers to the m-th zero of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). We need the first two zeros to find the angular positions of the first two minima.\n*   The first zero (m=1): z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   The second zero (m=2): z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\n    θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\n    θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 7.0156 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ z₂ * λ / (2π * a) ] - [ z₁ * λ / (2π * a) ]\nΔθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n\nPlugging in the values for the zeros:\nΔθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)\n\nThe calculation was performed in the thinking step using Python, and the output was `0.5067334233102856`.\n\nRounding this to three decimal places, we get:\nΔθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
