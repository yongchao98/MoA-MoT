    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial conditions and given relations:**\n*   Initial nucleus mass: M\n*   Initial rest energy: $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   The more massive fragment is $m_1$.\n*   Relation between fragment masses: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   Sum of fragment rest-masses: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-masses and rest-mass energies of the two fragments:**\n*   We have a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n*   Now, find $m_1$:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 1 ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 2 ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released:**\n*   The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies is converted into the total kinetic energy ($T_{total}$) of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   $T_{total} = E_{initial} - E_{final\\_rest} = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $T_{total} = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$.\n*   $T_{total} = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   So, $T_1 + T_2 = 3$ GeV, where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment ($T_1$) using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n*   By the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n    $|p_1| = |p_2| = p$.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   Therefore, $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   This means $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = 3$ GeV.\n*   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   So, the classical value is $T_{1, class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct kinetic energy of the massive fragment ($T_1$) using relativistic mechanics:**\n*   Conservation of momentum still dictates that $|p_1| = |p_2| = p$.\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$, so the total energy is $E = T + mc^2$.\n*   We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate this expression for both fragments:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$.\n*   Now, we substitute the known values.\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 198$ GeV\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 99$ GeV\n    *   $T_2 = 3 - T_1$ (from $T_1 + T_2 = 3$ GeV)\n*   The equation becomes:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n\nI will use a python script to solve this equation accurately.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variable T1\nT1 = sympy.Symbol('T1')\n\n# Rest mass energies in GeV\nm1c2 = 198\nm2c2 = 99\n\n# Total kinetic energy in GeV\nT_total = 3\n\n# Express T2 in terms of T1\nT2 = T_total - T1\n\n# The relativistic momentum equation: p1^2*c^2 = p2^2*c^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\nequation = sympy.Eq(T1**2 + 2*T1*m1c2, T2**2 + 2*T2*m2c2)\n\n# Solve the equation for T1\nsolution = sympy.solve(equation, T1)\n\n# The solution will be a list, we take the first element\nT1_rel = solution[0]\n\n# The classical value for T1 is 1 GeV\nT1_class = 1\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_gev = T1_rel - T1_class\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_mev}\")\n```\nThe python script calculates the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   $T_{1, rel}$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.\n*   $T_{1, class} = 1$ GeV.\n*   The script solves the equation $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$ for $T_1$.\n*   Then it computes $(T_{1, rel} - 1) * 1000$ to get the final answer in MeV.\n\nLet's trace the manual calculation from the solved equation:\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + 594 - 198T_1$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$\n$396T_1 = -204T_1 + 603$\n$600T_1 = 603$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference between the two values:**\n*   Difference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\n*   Difference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Convert the difference to MeV:\n    $0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ MeV}}{1 \\text{ GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a summary of the steps taken to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n*   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n*   Initial momentum is $P_{initial} = 0$.\n\n**2. Spontaneous Fission:**\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   Given relations:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2$ (fragment 1 is more massive).\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**3. Calculate Fragment Rest-Masses and Energies:**\n*   From the given relations, we solve for the masses:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 0.66M$.\n*   We then calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n*   The loss in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   $T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = E_0 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $T_{total} = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate $T_1$ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n*   By conservation of momentum, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta: $|p_1| = |p_2| = p$.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. So, $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $T_{1, class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Calculate $T_1$ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n*   Momentum is still conserved: $|p_1| = |p_2| = p$.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since $E = T + mc^2$, this becomes $(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n*   Equating $(p_1c)^2$ and $(p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$.\n*   Substitute known values ($m_1c^2 = 198$, $m_2c^2 = 99$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$):\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3-T_1)^2 + 2(3-T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2 + 594 - 198T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n*   $T_{1, correct} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**7. Calculate the Difference:**\n*   Difference = $T_{1, correct} - T_{1, class} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Convert the difference to MeV:\n    *   $0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{MeV}}{\\text{GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
