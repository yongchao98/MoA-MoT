    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which can be taken as the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n2.  **Energy Width of a State:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy level. Instead, the energy is spread over a range ΔE, often called the natural linewidth or energy width. A shorter lifetime (smaller Δt) leads to a larger energy width (larger ΔE).\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy widths of the levels. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this will be the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n4.  **Calculations:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    Since state 1 has a shorter lifetime, it will have a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1), which will be the dominant factor. Let's calculate this uncertainty. We can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n    *   Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1):\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n        ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2):\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n        ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy width of the first level is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation must be significantly larger than this value. Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Clearly resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\nThe only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E approx h_bar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be resolved, the energy difference between the states must be greater than the larger energy width.\")\nprint(f\"The larger energy width is Delta_E1 = {delta_E1:.4e} eV.\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV is large enough for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV is NOT large enough for resolution.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the required energy difference to resolve two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle:**\nThe problem revolves around the energy-time uncertainty principle, which is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. It states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), its energy (E) is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nA common approximation used in spectroscopy and particle physics is that the energy width (Γ, which is equivalent to ΔE) of a state is related to its lifetime (τ, equivalent to Δt) by:\n\nΓ ≈ ħ/τ\n\n**2. Identify the Limiting Factor:**\nWe have two states with lifetimes:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the energy widths of both levels. If the energy difference is smaller than the width of either level, the energy distributions will overlap too much, making them indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, as seen from the formula Γ ≈ ħ/τ. A smaller denominator (τ) leads to a larger result (Γ).\n\nTherefore, the limiting factor for resolution is the energy width of the state with the shorter lifetime, which is τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Width:**\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE₁) corresponding to the shorter lifetime (τ₁):\n\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Compare with the Options:**\nThe condition for the two levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy difference must be significantly greater than the larger energy width, ΔE₁.\n\nEnergy Difference > ΔE₁\nEnergy Difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be clearly separated.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe only option that represents an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is 10⁻⁴ eV. The Python code executed in the previous step confirms this calculation and comparison, showing that only option B is a viable energy difference for resolution.\n\n<<<B>>>"
