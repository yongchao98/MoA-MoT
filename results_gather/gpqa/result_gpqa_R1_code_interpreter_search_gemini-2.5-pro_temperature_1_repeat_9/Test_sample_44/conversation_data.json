    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the energies of the system.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Single-Particle Energies\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For an electron in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`, which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n    where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²).\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    E_n = n² * E\n\nLet's list the first few single-particle energy levels:\n*   n = 1: E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n*   n = 2: E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n*   n = 3: E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n*   n = 4: E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n... and so on.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy configuration for the four-particle system. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1E):** Can hold two particles. We place two fermions here.\n*   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 4E):** Can hold two particles. We place the remaining two fermions here.\n\nNow, we sum the energies of all four particles:\n*   Energy from the two particles in n=1: 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1E) = 2E\n*   Energy from the two particles in n=2: 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E\n\nTotal Ground State Energy:\nE_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### 3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** We take one particle from the n=2 level and move it to the next available level, which is n=3.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles remain in n=1.\n    *   One particle remains in n=2.\n    *   One particle is now in n=3.\n\nTotal First Excited State Energy:\nE_1st = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\nE_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions that result in an energy higher than the first excited state (15E) and find the lowest one.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities starting from the ground state configuration:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is the first excited state (15E). The next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the Second Excited State Energy is **18E**.\n\n### Summary of Energies:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
