    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_0` in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment `mu` is aligned with this field. The magnetic moment operator is `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The interaction Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B`. For the initial field, `H_0 = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    *   For the moment to be \"aligned\" with the field, the system must be in the lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` is positive (as is typical for protons, for example), the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n    *   In the standard `S_z` basis, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<S_z> = +ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point in the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ (B * y_hat) = -γ * S_y * B`.\n    *   In the `S_z` basis, the spin operators are represented by matrices (related to the Pauli matrices `σ`):\n        *   `S_x = (ħ/2) * σ_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n        *   `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        *   `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   So, the new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation solution: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian `H`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i[-γBS_y]t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n    *   The operator `exp(iθS_y/ħ)` represents a rotation about the y-axis by an angle `-θ`. Here, `θ = γBt`.\n    *   Let `ω = γB`. This term `ω` is known as the Larmor frequency. The evolution operator becomes `exp(iωtS_y/ħ)`.\n    *   We can calculate the exponential of the matrix: `exp(iωt * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iαA) = cos(α)I + i sin(α)A` for any matrix `A` where `A²=I` (which is true for Pauli matrices), we get:\n        `exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y`\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]) * [[1], [0]]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (cos(ωt/2) * [[1], [0]]) + (i sin(ωt/2) * [[0], [i]])`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [0]] + [[0], [i*i*sin(ωt/2)]]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's find the expectation value of `S_z`: `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket: `<ψ(t)| = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`.\n    *   The calculation is:\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we have:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expression `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)` describes an oscillation.\n    *   The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing the forms, we see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = ω`.\n    *   We defined `ω = γB`.\n    *   So, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Alternative Method: Larmor Precession**\n    *   Classical electromagnetism tells us that a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`.\n    *   The torque causes a change in the angular momentum `S` (`τ = dS/dt`).\n    *   Since `μ = γS`, we have `dS/dt = γS x B`.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   In our problem, the spin starts along the Z-axis (`S(0) = (0, 0, S_z)`), and the new field is along the Y-axis (`B = (0, B, 0)`). The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis will vary sinusoidally (specifically, as a cosine function since it starts fully along Z). The frequency of this variation is the precession frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component is the Larmor frequency, `Ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
