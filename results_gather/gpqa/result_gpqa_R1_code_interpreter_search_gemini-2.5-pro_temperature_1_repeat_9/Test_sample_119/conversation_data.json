    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it ρ (rho), is constant everywhere. The number of stars (N) in any given volume (V) is simply N = ρ * V.\n\n2.  **Consider a volume of space:** Let's think about the stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from us. Let the thickness of this shell be a very small amount, `dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of the shell:** The volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πd³. The surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is A = 4πd². The volume of the thin shell (dV) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    dV = A * dd = 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars in the shell:** Using our assumption of uniform density ρ, the number of stars (dN) in this thin shell is:\n    dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² * dd)\n\n5.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance. For simplicity, let's use the standard astronomical units where `plx = 1/d` (with `plx` in arcseconds and `d` in parsecs). From this relationship, we can also express `d` in terms of `plx`:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n6.  **Relate the infinitesimal changes (dd and d(plx)):** We need to find how a small change in distance (`dd`) relates to a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²\n    Rearranging this gives us the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`:\n    dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    Since we are counting stars, we are only interested in the magnitude of the change, not the direction (the negative sign just shows that as distance increases, parallax decreases). So we can write:\n    |dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|\n\n7.  **Substitute parallax into the star count equation:** Now we take our equation for the number of stars in the shell (dN) and replace the distance terms (`d` and `dd`) with their parallax equivalents.\n    Original equation: dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n    Substitute d = 1/plx: dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd\n    Substitute dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx): dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression:** Combine the terms to get the final relationship between the number of stars `dN` in a small parallax range `d(plx)`:\n    dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n9.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is mathematically represented as dN/d(plx). We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n    dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴\n\n10. **Determine the proportionality:** In this final expression, ρ, 4, and π are all constants. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the remaining term:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
