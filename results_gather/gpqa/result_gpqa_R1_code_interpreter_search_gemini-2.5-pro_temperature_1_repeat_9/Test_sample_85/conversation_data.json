    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester), also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing O(1), C(2)=O, C(3), C(4)-Et, C(5), C(6).\n    *   This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this open-chain precursor is at C3.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). Specifically, it's **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3 and contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe problem involves reducing the starting material, which has two reducible groups, with two different selective reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu)` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n        2.  The resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone product.\n    *   The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups is preserved.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu)` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n        2.  The resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the same lactone product.\n    *   Again, the reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, preserving its spatial arrangement.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in how the R/S designation changes (or doesn't change) due to the change in chemical groups attached to the chiral center. The R/S designation depends on the priority of the substituents.\n\n**Priorities in the Starting Material (A and B):**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral carbon C3 are:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority, since the ester carbon is considered bonded to three oxygens, one of which is further attached to a carbon)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority, as the carboxyl carbon is bonded to three oxygens, one of which is attached to hydrogen. C > H)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H` (Lowest priority)\n\n**Analysis for Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n*   `A` → Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) → `(R)`-lactone\n*   The original groups `-CH₂COOiBu` (Priority 1) and `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) are transformed into `-CH₂CH₂OH` and `-CH₂COOH` respectively.\n*   **Priorities in the intermediate:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOH` (New Priority 1)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New Priority 2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Conclusion:** The original Priority 1 group becomes the new Priority 2 group, and the original Priority 2 group becomes the new Priority 1 group. The priorities of the top two substituents are **swapped**. This causes an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n*   Therefore, to obtain an `(R)`-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   `(S)`-A → `(R)`-Intermediate → `(R)`-Lactone\n\n**Analysis for Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n*   `B` → Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) → `(S)`-lactone\n*   The original groups `-CH₂COOiBu` (Priority 1) and `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) are transformed into `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH` respectively.\n*   **Priorities in the intermediate:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (New Priority 1)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New Priority 2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Conclusion:** The original Priority 1 group remains the new Priority 1 group. The group derived from the original Priority 2 becomes the new Priority 2. The priority order of the main substituents is **retained**. This means there is **no change in the R/S designation**.\n*   Therefore, to obtain an `(S)`-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   `(S)`-B → `(S)`-Intermediate → `(S)`-Lactone\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
