    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) indicates that the distribution of atoms across these energy levels is governed by the **Boltzmann distribution**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states. Let $N_b$ be the number of atoms in an excited state with energy $E_b$, and $N_a$ be the number of atoms in a lower state with energy $E_a$. The ratio is given by:\n    $N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T))$\n    Where:\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the states (constants for a given transition).\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** We need to write the Boltzmann equation for star_1 (temperature $T_1$) and star_2 (temperature $T_2$). The term \"excitation\" refers to the ratio of atoms in the excited state to those in the ground state. Let's call this ratio $R$.\n\n    *   For star_1: $R_1 = (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n    *   For star_2: $R_2 = (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n    $R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship:**\n    $(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, $(g_b / g_a)$, is the same for both stars since it's the same atomic transition. Therefore, it cancels out from both sides:\n    $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation and use the properties of exponents and logarithms.\n    *   Divide both sides by $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$:\n        $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) / exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)) = 2$\n    *   Use the exponent rule $e^x / e^y = e^{x-y}$:\n        $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) - (-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))) = 2$\n        $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) + \\Delta E / (k * T_2)) = 2$\n    *   Factor out the common term $(\\Delta E / k)$:\n        $exp((\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)) = 2$\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        $(\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)$\n    *   Combine the fractions in the parenthesis: $(1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)$:\n        $(\\Delta E / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)$\n\n8.  **Use the given numerical values to simplify further:** The problem provides the energy difference $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J. The Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K. The problem is designed such that the ratio of these two constants is approximately 1.\n    *   $(\\Delta E / k) \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) \\approx 1$ K.\n    *   Substituting this value into our equation:\n        $1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)$\n\n9.  **Final Equation:** The resulting equation is:\n    $ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)$\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
