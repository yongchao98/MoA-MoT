    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the given spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n*   X = 0 (halogen atoms)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a benzene ring).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** It is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   This suggests the `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** It is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift, indicating the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, almost certainly the oxygen of the ester (`-COO-CH₂-`).\n    *   Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those on an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH).\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration:** A total of 4 protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the aromatic protons, shifting them upfield. The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields protons, shifting them downfield.\n        *   The upfield doublet at **7.0 ppm** corresponds to the two protons ortho to the activating -NH₂ group.\n        *   The downfield doublet at **8.0 ppm** corresponds to the two protons ortho to the deactivating -COOEt group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound has:\n1.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and functional group (amide, not ester).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Contains a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the connectivity is different (`-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). The NMR for the propionate's -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the DoU, the primary amine and conjugated ester from IR, and all the signals (ethyl group, NH₂, para-disubstituted ring) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
