    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs (3 double bonds + 1 ring). The remaining DBE is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (a -CH- group). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment, as the CH2 is coupled to the CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure of the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (or 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 (amine) + C2H3O (acetaldehyde group) = **C8H9NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The first reagent, `NaNO2 + HCl` (at low temperature, which is implied), is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n        The intermediate is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  The second reagent, `H2O` (with warming), reacts with the diazonium salt to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas. This is a **hydrolysis** reaction.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    1.  The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    2.  Aqueous KOH is a strong base, and when combined with an aldehyde possessing α-hydrogens, it catalyzes an **aldol reaction**. Since two molecules of the same aldehyde are reacting, it is a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    3.  The term \"Heat\" indicates that the initial aldol addition product will undergo **dehydration** (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated final product.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the final product from the aldol condensation.**\n\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌  [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form the aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n    4.  **Dehydration:** With heat, this aldol addition product readily eliminates a molecule of water. The -OH group from C3 and the acidic α-proton from C2 are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:**\n    The dehydration product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\nB) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This perfectly matches our derived final product.\nC) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\nD) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, resulting from a different reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
