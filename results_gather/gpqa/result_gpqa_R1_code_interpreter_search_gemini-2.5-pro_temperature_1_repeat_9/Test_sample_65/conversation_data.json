    "Here is a breakdown of the symmetries in the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT):\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry & 2. Poincaré Symmetry:**\n    *   The Standard Model (SM) itself is a relativistic quantum field theory. This means its Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincaré transformations, which consist of Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations.\n    *   SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. A fundamental assumption in the construction of the standard SMEFT is that these new operators also respect the underlying spacetime symmetries. Each operator added to the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar, ensuring the action remains invariant. Therefore, Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are preserved by construction in SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):**\n    *   CP symmetry is *not* a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model. The weak interaction, through the complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, violates CP symmetry.\n    *   Since the SM itself violates CP, there is no requirement for the new operators in SMEFT to respect it. In fact, SMEFT introduces many new higher-dimensional operators that can provide additional sources of CP violation, which are a subject of intense experimental and theoretical study.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time):**\n    *   The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT.\n    *   Since SMEFT is formulated as a local and Lorentz-invariant field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a more drastic modification of physics than what is assumed in the SMEFT framework (e.g., abandoning Lorentz invariance or locality).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n*   Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n*   CP symmetry (3) is *not* required to be respected.\n*   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
