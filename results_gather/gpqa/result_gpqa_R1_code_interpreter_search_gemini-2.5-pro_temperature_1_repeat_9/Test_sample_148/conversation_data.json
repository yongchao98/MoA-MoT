    "*   **Analysis of the Observations:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals summing to one, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two environments must belong to two different species that are present in approximately equal amounts. The fact that these species are so similar that they only cause a small shift difference for the alpha-proton suggests they are very closely related isomers.\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:** The LC (Liquid Chromatography) experiment separates compounds based on their physical properties. The observation of two distinct peaks confirms the presence of two different species. The fact that they can be separated means they are not enantiomers (which would co-elute on a standard, achiral column). The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks have the identical mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. This proves that the two species are isomers of each other, not an impurity or a precursor (which would have a different mass).\n    3.  **Synthesis Context:** The compound is a \"peptidic compound,\" which means it contains amide bonds.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and are distinguishable by NMR and can be separated by standard chromatography (LC). This fits the observations perfectly. A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is the restricted rotation around the C-N amide bond, which can exist in either a *cis* or *trans* conformation. These *cis/trans* isomers (also called rotamers or atropisomers) are a specific type of diastereomer. The interconversion between them can be slow on the NMR and chromatography time scales, leading to separate signals and peaks. The \"elevated temperature\" in the LC-MS might have been used to sharpen the peaks, but the observation of two clear peaks shows that interconversion is still slow enough for separation. This is the most plausible explanation.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they are indistinguishable by NMR and co-elute on a standard (achiral) LC column. This contradicts the observation of two peaks in both the NMR and the LC.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would imply that an extra amino acid has been added to the peptide chain. This would result in a molecule with a significantly different (higher) mass. The MS data shows that both peaks have the *expected* mass, ruling this out.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a different molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows that both peaks have the same mass, corresponding to the final product, which rules out contamination by a precursor.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observations are all consistent with the presence of two diastereomeric forms of the same molecule. In the context of a peptide, this is most likely due to *cis/trans* isomerization around an amide bond. Therefore, the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
