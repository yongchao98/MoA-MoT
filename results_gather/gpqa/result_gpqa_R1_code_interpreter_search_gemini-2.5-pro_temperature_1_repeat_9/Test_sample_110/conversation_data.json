    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction and reactants:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is the ketone that will form an enolate.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base used to deprotonate the ketone to form the enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the α,β-unsaturated ester that will be attacked by the enolate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming a single regioisomeric enolate.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (usually during aqueous workup) neutralizes the resulting enolate intermediate from the acrylate part.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the following structure: A cyclohexanone ring with the carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group and a `-(CH₂CH₂COOEt)` group at C6.\n    *   The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. We need to name our product according to this convention.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, the carbon atom attached to the propanoate chain is numbered C1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. This carbon (now C1 of the substituent) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Moving around the ring, the original C1 (the carbonyl carbon) is now C2. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3. So, we have a **3-ethyl** and a **3-methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options **B** and **D**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction and reactants:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) is the nitroalkane. Its α-protons (on the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the base used to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane. This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻\n\n3.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   For CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is protonated by water (H₂O).\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product B:**\n    *   The product structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we follow IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (-CN) has the highest priority and its carbon is numbered C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A **methyl** group at C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Putting it all together, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct product names.\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n\n<<<D>>>"
