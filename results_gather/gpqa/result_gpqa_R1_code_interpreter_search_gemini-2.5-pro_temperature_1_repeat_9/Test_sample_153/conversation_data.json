    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the M+ peak, has an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very characteristic absorption for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. The extreme broadness is a key feature.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm are in the aromatic region, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular formula consistent with C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW=156 for ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR, we know it is a carboxylic acid.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know it is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\nCombining these findings, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a *para* (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid and would not give the IR or ¹H NMR signals observed.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** This structure is a *para*-substituted carboxylic acid containing chlorine. It perfectly matches all the spectral data: MW of 156, the 3:1 M+/M+2 ratio, the characteristic IR peaks for a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR pattern for a *para*-substituted ring plus a carboxylic acid proton.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm, and its IR spectrum would be different.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
