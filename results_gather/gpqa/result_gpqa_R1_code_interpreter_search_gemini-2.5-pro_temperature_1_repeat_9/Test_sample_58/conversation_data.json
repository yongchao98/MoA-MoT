    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their nature:**\n*   `CH3COOH` (Acetic Acid): A weak acid.\n*   `HCl` (Hydrochloric Acid): A strong acid.\n*   `Ba(OH)2` (Barium Hydroxide): A strong base.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\nThe number of moles is calculated using the formula: `Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L)`.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   `HCl` is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (`HCl → H+ + Cl-`).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of `H+` = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   `Ba(OH)2` is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (`Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-`).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of `OH-` = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**3. Determine the net result of the acid-base reactions:**\nThe neutralization reactions will occur in a specific order: strong acid reacts with strong base first.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Reaction between Strong Acid (H+) and Strong Base (OH-)**\n    *   Reaction: `H+ + OH- → H2O`\n    *   Initial moles of `H+` = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of `OH-` = 0.180 mol\n    *   The `H+` is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of `OH-` remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Reaction between remaining Strong Base (OH-) and Weak Acid (CH3COOH)**\n    *   Now, the excess strong base (`OH-`) reacts with the weak acid (`CH3COOH`).\n    *   Reaction: `CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O`\n    *   Initial moles of `CH3COOH` = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of `OH-` available for this reaction = 0.100 mol\n    *   The `CH3COOH` is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of `OH-` remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (`OH-`). The presence of this strong base will dominate the pH, making the contribution from the weak conjugate base (`CH3COO-`) negligible.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   `[OH-]` = Moles of excess `OH-` / Total Volume\n    *   `[OH-]` = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   `pOH = -log10([OH-])`\n    *   `pOH = -log10(0.04167)`\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   `pH = 14 - pOH`\n\nTo get the precise numerical answer, we use a calculator.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500  # 0.050 mol\nmoles_h_plus = 0.2 * 0.400  # 0.080 mol\nmoles_oh_minus = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300)  # 0.180 mol\n\n# Neutralization reactions\n# 1. Strong acid vs. strong base\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_minus - moles_h_plus # 0.180 - 0.080 = 0.100 mol\n\n# 2. Remaining strong base vs. weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh # 0.100 - 0.050 = 0.050 mol\n\n# Final concentration and pH calculation\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300 # 1.200 L\nfinal_oh_concentration = moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\n\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH=12.62\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The initial step is to calculate the number of moles for each species involved in the reaction.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely: `HCl → H+ + Cl-`\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely to produce two hydroxide ions: `Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-`\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\nNext, we account for the neutralization reactions. The strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and any remaining OH- will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n1.  **Reaction between Strong Acid and Strong Base:**\n    *   `H+ + OH- → H2O`\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ from HCl is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n2.  **Reaction between Remaining Strong Base and Weak Acid:**\n    *   `CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O`\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nNow, the final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-]) = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
