    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We need to identify what each tube absorbs and calculate the amount of substance.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful drying agent. The increase in its mass is due to the absorption of water (H2O).\n    *   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H2O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, such as CO2 or SO2, by forming a precipitate.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O2). The problem states CuO is formed.\n    *   The reaction is: 2Cu(s) + O2(g) → 2CuO(s).\n    *   The increase in the mass of the tube corresponds to the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of O2 is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O2 = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, an alkali solution, or hot copper. This suggests it's a relatively inert gas. Given that the salts likely contain nitrogen (common in thermally unstable salts), gas C is very likely nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n**2. Verify the Composition and Mass Balance**\n\nLet's check if the identified products (H2O, O2, and N2) account for the total initial mass of the salts.\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass of the mixture of salts (7.20 g), confirming our identification of the gaseous products and their quantities.\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salts Mixture**\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the products, which must equal the moles of elements in the initial salt mixture.\n*   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 2 × moles of H2O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n*   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 2 × moles of N2 = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (1 × moles of H2O) + (2 × moles of O2) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let 'n' be the number of moles for each salt. The total composition of (n A + n B) contains 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\nThe ratio of atoms in the combined molecular formula (A + B) will be the same as the ratio of moles of the elements:\nH : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\nH : N : O = (0.4 × 20) : (0.2 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = 8 : 4 : 5.\nSo, the combined formula for one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B is H8N4O5.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to find two common salts, A and B, whose formulas sum up to H8N4O5. Since the salts decompose upon heating to produce H2O, N2, and O2, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids.\nLet's try to partition H8N4O5 into two plausible salt formulas:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3):** Formula is H4N2O3.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2):** Formula is H4N2O2.\n\nLet's check if their sum matches our derived formula:\n(H4N2O3) + (H4N2O2) = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salt A is NH4NO3 and salt B is NH4NO2 (or vice versa).\n\nWe can perform a final consistency check using the molar masses.\n```python\n# Molar masses: H=1.008, N=14.007, O=15.999\nM_A = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 3  # Molar mass of NH4NO3\nM_B = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 2  # Molar mass of NH4NO2\ntotal_molar_mass_AB = M_A + M_B\ntotal_mass = 7.20\n# total_mass = n * (M_A + M_B)\nn = total_mass / total_molar_mass_AB\nprint(f\"M(NH4NO3) = {M_A}\")\nprint(f\"M(NH4NO2) = {M_B}\")\nprint(f\"Moles of each salt, n = {n:.3f}\")\n# Check if this n value yields the correct amount of products\n# Total formula is H8N4O5\nmoles_H = n * 8\nmoles_N = n * 4\nmoles_O = n * 5\nmoles_H2O = moles_H / 2\nmoles_N2 = moles_N / 2\n# Moles of O in O2 = total O - O in H2O\nmoles_O_in_O2 = moles_O - moles_H2O\nmoles_O2 = moles_O_in_O2 / 2\nprint(f\"Calculated moles H2O = {moles_H2O:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated moles N2 = {moles_N2:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated moles O2 = {moles_O2:.3f}\")\n```\nM(NH4NO3) = 80.043\nM(NH4NO2) = 64.044\nMoles of each salt, n = 0.050\nCalculated moles H2O = 0.200\nCalculated moles N2 = 0.100\nCalculated moles O2 = 0.025\n\nThe calculated moles from our identified salts and their amount (n=0.05 mol) perfectly match the experimental results (0.2 mol H2O, 0.1 mol N2, 0.025 mol O2). This confirms our identification is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO3):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO2):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. When heated, this mixture decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. Let's analyze the fate of these gases.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n    *   The gas mixture is first passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, a strong dehydrating agent. The mass of this tube increases by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (H2O) absorbed.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   Next, the remaining gas mixture is passed through a Ca(OH)2 solution. The mass of this tube does not change. This indicates the absence of acidic gases like CO2 or SO2.\n\n    *   Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper. The mass of the copper tube increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This increase in mass is due to the oxygen (O2) reacting with the copper.\n        *   The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The mass increase is the mass of O2.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   Finally, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n        *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N2).\n\n2.  **Mass Conservation and Elemental Composition**\n    Let's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N2 = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass, so our product identification is correct.\n\n    Now, let's find the total moles of each element in the original salt mixture.\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 2 × moles of H2O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 2 × moles of N2 = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O in O2) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n3.  **Identifying Salts A and B**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. This means the number of moles of A is equal to the number of moles of B. The total elemental composition of the mixture (from 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O) must be distributed between A and B.\n    The ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B) is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\n    H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    So, the combined empirical formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is H8N4O5.\n\n    We need to find two common thermally unstable salts whose formulas sum to H8N4O5. Given the products, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)**. Its formula is H4N2O3.\n    *   Let's consider **Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)**. Its formula is H4N2O2.\n\n    Let's sum these two formulas:\n    (H4N2O3) + (H4N2O2) = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5.\n    This is a perfect match. So, the salts are A = NH4NO3 and B = NH4NO2.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A (NH4NO3): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt B (NH4NO2): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n    Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
