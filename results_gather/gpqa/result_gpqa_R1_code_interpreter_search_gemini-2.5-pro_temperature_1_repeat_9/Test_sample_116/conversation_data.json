    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A molecule is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Common causes of chirality include the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond. The ortho positions (2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at positions 2 and 2', and nitro groups (-NO₂) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyls, if the ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called hindered rotation. If the substitution pattern also removes all planes of symmetry, the molecule becomes chiral. This specific type of chirality is known as **atropisomerism** (a form of axial chirality).\n    *   In this molecule, the four large substituents prevent the rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on the second carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. We check the four groups attached to this carbon:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized as it is part of a double bond. It is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the O=C bond angle and the angle between the two C-phenyl bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (a *trans* configuration).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar because of the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As the molecule has elements of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Achiral.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
