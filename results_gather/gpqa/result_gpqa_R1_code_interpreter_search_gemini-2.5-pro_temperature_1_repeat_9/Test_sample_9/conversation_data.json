    "Rationale Breakdown:\nThe question asks to identify which of the four described exoplanets has the highest density. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\nThis serves as our baseline reference. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote Earth's mass as M_E, its radius as R_E, and its density as ρ_E.\nSo, for planet (a), ρ_a ≈ ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\nThe density is explicitly given.\nρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n**d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\nThis planet has a mass M_d = 0.5 * M_E. Since it has the same composition as Earth but is less massive, the force of its own gravity will be weaker. This leads to less gravitational compression of its materials compared to Earth. Therefore, its average density will be lower than Earth's density.\nρ_d < ρ_E.\n\n**c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\nThis planet has a mass M_c = 5 * M_E. Because it is significantly more massive than Earth and has the same composition, its own gravity will compress its constituent materials much more strongly. This gravitational compression increases the planet's average density. Therefore, its density will be significantly higher than Earth's density.\nρ_c > ρ_E.\n\n**Comparison:**\nNow, let's compare the densities of the four planets:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and gravitational compression)\n*   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less gravitational compression)\n\nFrom this comparison, it is clear that planet (c) will have the highest density. The increased mass leads to greater self-gravitation, which compresses the material and results in a higher overall density. This principle is a key concept in planetary science for understanding the structure of terrestrial planets and \"Super-Earths\".\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate, we can use the established mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is often approximated as R ∝ M^0.27.\nThe density is ρ ∝ M/R³.\nSo, ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\nLet's calculate the density for planet (c) relative to Earth (planet a):\nρ_c / ρ_a = (M_c / M_a)^0.19 = (5 * M_E / M_E)^0.19 = 5^0.19.\n5^0.19 ≈ 1.38.\nThis means the density of planet (c) is approximately 1.38 times the density of Earth.\nρ_c ≈ 1.38 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 7.6 g/cm³.\nThis value is clearly the highest among all options.\n\nConclusion: The planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass will be compressed by its own gravity to a much higher density than the other planets described.\n\nFinal check:\n*   a: ~5.51 g/cm³\n*   b: ~5.50 g/cm³\n*   c: ~7.6 g/cm³\n*   d: Less than 5.51 g/cm³\n\nThe highest density belongs to option (c).\n\n<<<D>>>"
