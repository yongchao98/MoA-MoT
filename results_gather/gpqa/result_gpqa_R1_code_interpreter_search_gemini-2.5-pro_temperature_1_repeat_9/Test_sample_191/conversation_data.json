    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System and Charges:**\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius R, which is initially uncharged.\n    *   Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity of radius r.\n    *   A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:**\n    *   The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges in the conductor towards it. Since charges can only reside on the surfaces of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, a total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface inside the conductor material, enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, `q_enclosed = (+q) + q_inner_surface = 0`, which implies `q_inner_surface = -q`.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain charge conservation. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the conductor. So, `q_outer_surface = +q`.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges: the original charge `+q` inside the cavity, the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, and the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   The combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Because the conductor is spherical and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n    *   According to shell theorem (a result from Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   Treating the `+q` on the outer surface as a point charge at the center O, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    *   Substituting the values, we get:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The result we derived is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center to P (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) is extraneous information for calculating the field *outside* the conductor. This information would be needed to calculate the field *inside* the cavity, but not outside.\n    *   Comparing our result with the given options:\n        *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our result perfectly.\n        *   B), C), D) are incorrect as they do not correctly apply the principle of electrostatic shielding and the properties of a uniformly charged sphere. They are based on distances from the cavity's center (`l`) or complex geometric relations, which are irrelevant due to the shielding.\n\n<<<A>>>"
