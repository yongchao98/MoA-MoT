    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** This is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n*   **λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP):** This refers to the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Since the target molecules are also moving, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the denominator.\n    *   Formula: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the number density of gas molecules, and σ_gg is the gas-gas collision cross-section (the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron MFP):** This refers to the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them extremely fast (relativistic speeds, close to the speed of light). Compared to this, the thermal motion of the gas molecules is negligible. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   Formula: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the same number density of gas molecules, and σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section (the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event).\n\n### **2. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ1 and λ2, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nThis equation reveals two key differences that determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1:\n1.  **The √2 Factor:** This factor is present simply because λ1 describes collisions between moving particles of similar mass, while λ2 describes a very fast particle hitting stationary targets. This factor alone means that if the cross-sections were identical (σ_gg = σ_eg), then λ2 would be √2 times λ1 (λ2 = 1.414 * λ1).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg** is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules. It's the area presented by one molecule to another in a \"billiard ball\" type collision.\n    *   **σ_eg** is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. An electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the atom's electromagnetic field. Because an atom is mostly empty space, a high-energy electron can often pass through without a significant interaction (scattering). Therefore, the effective target area for an electron (σ_eg) is generally considered to be *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules (σ_gg).\n    *   If σ_eg < σ_gg, then the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n\n### **3. Synthesize the Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two points above:\n\n*   The ratio λ2 / λ1 has a baseline factor of √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   This factor is multiplied by (σ_gg / σ_eg), which is also expected to be greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, the total ratio (λ2 / λ1) must be significantly greater than √2. A common approximation in vacuum technology textbooks suggests this ratio can be as high as 4√2 ≈ 5.66.\n\nIn any physically realistic scenario for this problem, **λ2 > √2 * λ1**, which means **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's look at the given choices:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer, not shorter.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our analysis shows that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1. The upper bound of 1.22*λ1 is too low.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. This ignores both the relative motion factor (√2) and the difference in collision cross-sections.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Since our physical reasoning concludes that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly also greater than 1.22 * λ1. This statement is a robustly true conclusion based on the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
