    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle, $X^0$.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understanding the Physics:**\n    *   A particle $X^0$ with a proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is moving at relativistic speeds. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber) is longer.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The particle travels a certain distance, called the decay length $L$, before it decays. This distance is given by $L = v \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   Particle decay is a probabilistic process. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law: $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$. This can be expressed in terms of the distance traveled, $L = vt$: $P(L) = e^{-L/(v\\tau)} = e^{-L/L_{mean}}$, where $L_{mean} = v\\tau$ is the mean decay length.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Condition:**\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's minimum resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$.\n    *   The problem states that we need to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means the probability that the decay length $L$ is greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n    *   Mathematically, this is expressed as: $P(L > d_{res}) = 0.30$.\n    *   Using the decay probability formula: $P(L > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L_{mean}} = 0.30$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{d_{res}}{L_{mean}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n        $d_{res} = - \\ln(0.30) \\times L_{mean}$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Necessary Quantities:**\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass Energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($L_{mean}$).**\n        The mean decay length is $L_{mean} = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n        We can relate velocity and gamma using $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n        Therefore, $L_{mean} = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the resolution ($d_{res}$).**\n        Substitute the expression for $L_{mean}$ into the equation for $d_{res}$:\n        $d_{res} = - \\ln(0.30) \\times (c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1})$\n\n4.  **Computation:**\n    We can use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants and given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (L_mean)\n# L_mean = v * gamma * tau0 = c * beta * gamma * tau0\n# where beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n# So, L_mean = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL_mean = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Calculate the required resolution (d_res)\n# The probability of a particle decaying after distance d is P(L > d) = exp(-d / L_mean)\n# We set this probability to our target fraction: exp(-d_res / L_mean) = 0.30\n# Taking the natural log: -d_res / L_mean = ln(0.30)\n# d_res = -ln(0.30) * L_mean\nd_res = -np.log(fraction_to_observe) * L_mean\n\nprint(f\"{d_res:.3e}\")\n```\n```output\n2.268e-06\n```\nThe calculated resolution is approximately $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

Its lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is longer than its proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Decay Length:** In the lab frame, the particle travels a certain distance, the decay length ($L$), before it decays. The *mean decay length* ($L_{mean}$) is the average distance it travels. This is given by $L_{mean} = v \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $L$ or more before decaying is given by an exponential law: $P(\\text{distance} > L) = e^{-L/L_{mean}}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    *   \"To observe a decay\" means that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's minimum resolution, $d_{res}$.

We can express this more conveniently using the relation $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$ and the definitions $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$ and $p = \\gamma m_0 v$. A direct and useful formula is $L_{mean} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.

The probability of traveling a distance greater than some value $d$ before decaying is $P(L > d) = e^{-d/L_{mean}}$, where $L_{mean} = v \\tau_{lab}$ is the mean decay length.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Condition:**\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$).\n    *   The requirement to observe at least 30% of decays translates to the mathematical condition: $P(L > d_{res}) = 0.30$.\n    *   This gives the equation: $e^{-d_{res}/L_{mean}} = 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Resolution:**\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get: $d_{res} = -\\ln(0.30) \\times L_{mean}$.\n    *   The mean decay length is calculated as $L_{mean} = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate mean decay length $L_{mean}$.**\n        $L_{mean} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{7.918^2 - 1} \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate resolution $d_{res}$.**\n        $d_{res} = -\\ln(0.30) \\times L_{mean} \\approx -(-1.204) \\times (1.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.26 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThe code execution confirmed this result, calculating the resolution to be $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this value with the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe value calculated ($2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's source values.\n\n<<<B>>>"
