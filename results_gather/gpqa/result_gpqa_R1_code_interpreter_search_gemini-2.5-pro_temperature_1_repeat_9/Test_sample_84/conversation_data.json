    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo (the fraction of power reflected).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It also assumes that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ( (2 * a2) / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n*(Note: This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass and the orbital inclination is ~90°, which is a valid assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods).*\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\nUsing the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` are constant for both planets and cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Determine the Input Ratios from the Problem Statement**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n    The radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`. The amplitude `K` is therefore directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max`.\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Compute the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nSubstitute the mass and RV amplitude ratios into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nNow, substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we compute the value of 15/28.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2)\nk_ratio = 3 / 4\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (k_ratio**2)\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357. This value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`.\n\nThese common terms cancel out in the ratio, simplifying the equation to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nNow, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. We can find this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n`K = M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(1 - e^2) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nSince the planets are detected via the transit method, we can assume the inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The orbits are circular, so the eccentricity `e = 0`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\nLet's rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nThe radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by the formula `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`. The velocity amplitude `K` is therefore directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max`.\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (`Δλ_1`) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (`Δλ_2`) = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratios:\n*   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
