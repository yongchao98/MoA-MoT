    "One of the central problems in fundamental physics is dealing with infinities that arise in calculations, particularly those involving high energies or, equivalently, very short distances. The procedure used to handle these infinities is called regularization. Let's analyze each option in the context of this problem.\n\nA) **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. A major issue arises when considering a point-like charged particle, like an electron. The energy stored in the electric field of a point charge is infinite if you integrate down to a radius of zero. This is known as the self-energy problem. To avoid this infinity, one has to introduce a cutoff, essentially \"regularizing\" the theory by assuming the charge is not a true point but has some small, non-zero size. Thus, the classical theory does face issues at short distances that require some form of modification or cutoff.\n\nB) **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. When calculating interactions, especially those involving virtual particle loops, one encounters integrals that diverge at high energies (these are called ultraviolet or UV divergences). To extract finite, physically meaningful predictions, physicists employ a two-step process:\n1.  **Regularization**: The divergent integrals are made mathematically finite by introducing a parameter, such as an energy cutoff or a change in the dimensionality of spacetime (dimensional regularization).\n2.  **Renormalization**: The infinities, which are now controlled by the regularization parameter, are systematically absorbed into the redefinition of physical constants like the mass and charge of the electron.\nTherefore, QED fundamentally relies on regularization.\n\nD) **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the quantum field theory of the strong force, describing quarks and gluons. Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory and suffers from the same kind of ultraviolet (UV) divergences in its calculations. Consequently, it also requires the procedures of regularization and renormalization to make meaningful predictions.\n\nC) **Superstring Theory**: This theory posits that fundamental entities are not point-like particles but one-dimensional extended objects called \"strings.\" One of the most celebrated features of superstring theory is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. The interactions between strings are not point-like; they are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to divergences in point-particle theories like QED and QCD. The finite size of the string acts as a natural regulator, meaning that the calculations of physical quantities (like scattering amplitudes) are expected to yield finite results without the need to introduce an artificial regularization scheme. This is a primary reason why string theory is considered a promising candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, as it avoids the non-renormalizable infinities that plague attempts to quantize general relativity directly.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the framework that is constructed in such a way as to not require high-energy regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
