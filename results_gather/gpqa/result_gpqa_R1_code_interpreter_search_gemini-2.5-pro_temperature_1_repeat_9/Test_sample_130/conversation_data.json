    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the NMR data. Maleic anhydride is a planar, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two C=O groups. It possesses a high degree of symmetry. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. The two carbonyl carbons are also equivalent. This would lead to one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, which matches the data provided. The chemical shifts (¹H at 7 ppm, ¹³C at 137 ppm for C=C and 165 ppm for C=O) are also fully consistent with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile in the reaction is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the kinetically controlled product, which is typically the major product, is the *endo* adduct. In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system (in this case, the C=C bond from the diene). A more intuitive way for cyclopentadiene adducts is that the dienophile substituents are on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge.\n*   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct** and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and NMR of the Products for NOESY**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of J-coupling.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments in the Product:**\n    1.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused (let's call them C5 and C6). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. They correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  **Me_vinylic**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). They are equivalent due to symmetry. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent due to symmetry and are in an allylic/aliphatic environment. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **C7-H**: The two protons on the methylene bridge (C7). They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are coupled to each other, so they should appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which must be one of these two protons.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Proximity):**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are pointing into the bicyclic \"cage\". This brings them close to:\n        *   The **C7-H** protons (e.g., the one at ~1.5 ppm).\n        *   The **Me_vinylic** groups (~1.7 ppm), which are located at the other end of the cage.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons now point away from the cage. This makes them:\n        *   **Far** from the C7-H protons.\n        *   **Far** from the Me_vinylic groups.\n        *   **Close** to the Me_bridgehead groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Identifying the Differentiating Cross-Peak:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product must arise from a proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer. Based on our analysis, two such proximities exist:\n    1.  **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) <=> **C7-H** (~1.5 ppm) -> This corresponds to **Option A**.\n    2.  **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) <=> **Me_vinylic** (~1.7 ppm) -> This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n*   **Choosing Between Option A and Option D:**\n    Both describe valid NOEs that confirm the *endo* structure. However, we must choose the best answer. Let's consider the expected intensity of the NOE cross-peak. The intensity of a cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum is related (among other things) to the number of protons giving rise to the signals.\n    *   Option A involves an interaction between a 2H singlet and a 1H doublet.\n    *   Option D involves an interaction between a 2H singlet and a 6H singlet.\n    *   The interaction between the 2H and 6H groups involves a much larger number of protons than the interaction between the 2H and 1H groups. For a similar distance, this will result in a significantly more intense and easily observable cross-peak.\n    *   Furthermore, the NOE between the anhydride protons and the vinylic substituents is the classic, textbook example used to assign *endo* stereochemistry in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n    Therefore, the most prominent and characteristic cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product is the one between the vinylic methyl groups and the anhydride protons.\n\nFinal Answer Selection: The cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
