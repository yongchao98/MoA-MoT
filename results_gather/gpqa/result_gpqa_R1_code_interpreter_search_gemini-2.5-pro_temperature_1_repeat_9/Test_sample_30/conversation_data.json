    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the molecular symmetry group of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. The reaction yields a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. We will assume the reaction is carried forward with the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** *para*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO₂ is a specific oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes activated benzylic positions (the carbon atom attached to the benzene ring). The methyl group (-CH₃) is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO). This is a more plausible reaction than oxidation to a carboxylic acid, as the subsequent reaction involves acetone, which readily reacts with aldehydes.\n*   **Product 2:** *para*-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. 4-nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens, so it cannot self-condense. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule has a planar backbone due to the sp² hybridized carbons of the benzene ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group. This planarity is favored by the extensive conjugation.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 180° (C₂) or any other fraction of a full circle does not leave it unchanged. The nitro group on one side and the acetyl group on the other break any potential C₂ symmetry.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. For any atom at coordinates (x, y, z), there is not an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z).\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** There is one plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the entire planar framework of the molecule. This plane bisects the out-of-plane hydrogen atoms of the methyl group and the oxygen atoms of the nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of Product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<A>>>"
