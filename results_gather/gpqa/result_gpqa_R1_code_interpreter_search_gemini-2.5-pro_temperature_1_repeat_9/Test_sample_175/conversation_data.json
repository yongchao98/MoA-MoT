    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\nWe are given:\n*   The initial state of the system (unnormalized): `|ψ_un⟩` represented by the column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   The operator for observable P: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`.\n*   The operator for observable Q: `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a sequence of measurements: first, we measure P and get the result 0; then, we measure Q and get the result -1. This is a two-step process in quantum mechanics.\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we must work with a normalized state vector. The norm-squared of the initial state is:\n`⟨ψ_un|ψ_un⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe norm is `√6`.\nThe normalized initial state `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**3. First Measurement: Finding the Probability of P = 0**\n\nA measurement of an observable `P` can only yield one of its eigenvalues. The state of the system then collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P:**\n    We need to solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues of P are `λ = -1, 0, 1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the outcome P = 0:**\n    We need the eigenvector `|p₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. We solve `(P - 0I)|p₀⟩ = 0`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. Normalizing this vector (`x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1` => `2x² = 1` => `x = 1/√2`), we get the normalized eigenvector:\n    `|p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    According to the Born rule, the probability is `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * [(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1]`\n    No, the dot product is simpler:\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1) ]`\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2] = (1/√6) * [-2/√2] = (1/√6) * [-√2] = -√2/√6 = -1/√3`\n    The probability is:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse After the First Measurement**\n\nUpon measuring `P=0`, the system's state `|ψ⟩` collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p₀⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Finding the Probability of Q = -1**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the outcome Q = -1:**\n    The operator `Q` is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` for the eigenvalue `Q = -1` is:\n    `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1 in the new state `|ψ'⟩`:**\n    The probability is `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = 0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    The probability is:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<C>>>"
