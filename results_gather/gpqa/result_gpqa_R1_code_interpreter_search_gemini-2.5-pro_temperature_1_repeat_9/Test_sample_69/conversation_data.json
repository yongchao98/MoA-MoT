    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of E.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.**\n    This describes a simple addition reaction between two gases to form a solvent. A very common example in inorganic chemistry is the formation of phosgene or sulfuryl chloride.\n    *   **Hypothesis 1:** Carbon monoxide (CO) and Chlorine (Cl2). CO(g) + Cl2(g) -> COCl2(g/l). Phosgene (COCl2) is a toxic liquid below 8 °C and can be used as a non-aqueous solvent. This fits the 1:1 ratio. So, we can tentatively assign `{B, D} = {CO, Cl2}` and `H = COCl2`.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2:** Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and Chlorine (Cl2). SO2(g) + Cl2(g) -> SO2Cl2(l). Sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) is a liquid used as a solvent. This also fits.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: C + H2O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid).**\n    The hydrolysis of a single compound C produces two different acids, one strong and one weak. This is a very strong hint.\n    *   If C were a phosphorus halide like PCl5, hydrolysis yields H3PO4 (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). This matches the acid description.\n    *   This implies that C contains at least two different elements that can form acids upon hydrolysis.\n    *   Crucially, the reaction also **reforms the solid A**. This suggests that C is a complex or adduct of A, and the ligands attached to A are what hydrolyze. C -> A + (hydrolyzable parts).\n\n3.  **Combine Clues and Analyze Clue 1: A(s) + 8 equivalents of B(g) -> bright red product C.**\n    Let's test our hypothesis for B and D from step 1.\n\n    *   **Scenario A: Let B = Cl2 and D = CO.**\n        *   Clue 1 becomes: A(s) + 8Cl2(g) -> C(red). This would imply C is a very high chloride, like ACl16. This is chemically unlikely for most elements.\n        *   Clue 3 hydrolysis: Since C is a chloride, F would be HCl (strong acid), which is consistent. But this path struggles with the 1:8 stoichiometry.\n\n    *   **Scenario B: Let B = CO and D = Cl2.**\n        *   Clue 1 becomes: A(s) + 8CO(g) -> C(red). This points towards the chemistry of metal carbonyls. The reaction `2Co(s) + 8CO(g) -> Co2(CO)8(s)` is a classic synthesis.\n        *   Let's check if this fits:\n            *   **A = Co** (Cobalt metal, a solid).\n            *   **B = CO** (Carbon monoxide, a gas).\n            *   **C = Co2(CO)8** (Dicobalt octacarbonyl). This compound is an orange-red solid, which is a good match for \"bright red product\". The stoichiometry (8 equivalents of gas B form the product) fits perfectly.\n\n4.  **Validate the Cobalt Hypothesis with Other Clues.**\n    *   **A = Co, B = CO, C = Co2(CO)8**.\n    *   **Clue 4:** D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent). We assigned B=CO. So, D + CO -> H. For this to work with our initial hypothesis, D must be Cl2. Then `Cl2 + CO -> COCl2`. So, **D = Cl2** and **H = COCl2**. This is consistent.\n    *   **Clue 3:** C + H2O -> A + F + G. This becomes `Co2(CO)8 + H2O -> Co(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`.\n        *   The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls can be complex. In the presence of water, CO can form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is a weak acid. So, **G = H2CO3**.\n        *   Under certain conditions, metal carbonyls can form hydrido complexes that are acidic. Cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride (HCo(CO)4) is known to be a very strong acid, comparable to mineral acids. So, **F = HCo(CO)4**.\n        *   The fact that solid cobalt (A) is reformed suggests a disproportionation reaction, which is plausible for metal carbonyls, although unusual. This seems to be the most consistent explanation available.\n\n5.  **Determine the Identity and Symmetry of E.**\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E(extremely hazardous product).\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `Co2(CO)8 + 2Cl2 -> E`.\n    *   The reaction of dicobalt octacarbonyl with chlorine would lead to the cleavage of the Co-Co bond and displacement of CO ligands. A plausible reaction is the formation of a cobalt carbonyl chloride complex. For example:\n        `Co2(CO)8 + 2Cl2 -> 2 CoCl2(CO)x + (8-2x)CO`\n    *   A simple, stable product could be **dicarbonyldichlorocobalt(II)**, [CoCl2(CO)2]. Such compounds can be hazardous.\n    *   Now, we must determine the molecular symmetry of this proposed compound E = [CoCl2(CO)2].\n    *   As a d7 Co(II) complex, it can adopt several geometries. A low-spin square planar geometry is common for such complexes.\n    *   In a square planar geometry, a molecule with the formula MA2B2 can have two isomers:\n        *   **cis-[CoCl2(CO)2]**: The like ligands are adjacent. This molecule has a C2 rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Its point group is **C2v**.\n        *   **trans-[CoCl2(CO)2]**: The like ligands are opposite. This molecule has a C2 axis, two other perpendicular C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Its point group is D2h.\n    *   Given the options, **C2v** is a primary candidate. The cis isomer is often formed under kinetic control. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that E is cis-[CoCl2(CO)2] and its point group is C2v.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   A = Co (Cobalt)\n*   B = CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   C = Co2(CO)8 (Dicobalt octacarbonyl)\n*   D = Cl2 (Chlorine)\n*   E = cis-[CoCl2(CO)2] (cis-Dicarbonyldichlorocobalt(II))\n*   F = HCo(CO)4 (Cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride)\n*   G = H2CO3 (Carbonic acid)\n*   H = COCl2 (Phosgene)\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (cis-[CoCl2(CO)2]) is **C2v**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
