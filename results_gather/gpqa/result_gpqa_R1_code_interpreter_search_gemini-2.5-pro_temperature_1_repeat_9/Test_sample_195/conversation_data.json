    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the oscillating mass is conserved. In a relativistic framework, the total energy ($E_{tot}$) of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ moving in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy ($E_{rel}$) and its potential energy. The relativistic energy itself includes the rest mass energy.\n    $E_{tot} = E_{rel} + U(x)$\n    where $E_{rel} = \\gamma mc^2$ and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conserved total energy is:\n    $E_{tot} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude:**\n    At the maximum amplitude, the displacement is $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{tot} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum speed:**\n    The maximum speed, $v_{max}$, is achieved when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, where $x=0$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    The velocity is $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{tot} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$:**\n    First, let's isolate $\\gamma_{max}$ from the energy conservation equation:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can perform the following algebraic steps:\n    a. Square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    b. Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    c. Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    d. Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's check the classical limit. If the velocities are much smaller than $c$, then the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ must be very small. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - (1+\\epsilon)^{-2}}$\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$.\n$v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)} = c \\sqrt{2\\epsilon} = c \\sqrt{2 \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\nThis is the correct classical result, which confirms our relativistic formula.\n\n<<<C>>>"
