    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution with a symmetry axis (z-axis) acts as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiation pattern from such a source is a fundamental concept in classical electrodynamics.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, dP/dΩ, from an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    ```\n    dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    where θ is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and C is a constant that depends on the dipole moment, frequency, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle θ.\n\n    The function f mentioned in the question is this power per unit solid angle, so f is proportional to sin²(θ).\n    ```\n    f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    The maximum radiated power, A, occurs when sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    Therefore, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n    We need to find the fraction of A that is radiated at an angle θ = 30°. Let's call this power P₃₀.\n    `P₃₀ ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    The fraction is the ratio P₃₀ / A:\n    ```\n    Fraction = P₃₀ / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = sin²(30°) / 1\n    ```\n    We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    Therefore, the fraction is:\n    ```\n    Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4\n    ```\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The constant C in the power formula `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)` is not actually a constant with respect to the oscillation frequency (ω) or wavelength (λ). The full expression for the power per unit solid angle is:\n    ```\n    dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    where p₀ is the amplitude of the dipole moment, ω is the angular frequency, ε₀ is the permittivity of free space, and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The function f is therefore proportional to ω⁴.\n    `f ∝ ω⁴`\n    The relationship between angular frequency (ω) and wavelength (λ) is `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality for f:\n    `f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    So, a possible form for the function f must include a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the famous inverse fourth power law, also responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining our two findings:\n    *   The fraction of maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n    *   The radiated power is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\n    Matching these with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    Option C correctly identifies both the fraction and the wavelength dependence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
