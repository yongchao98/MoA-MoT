    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus X as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li), which consists of 6 nucleons.\n\n### **2. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed (v) is given by Einstein's equation for relativistic energy:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $E_0 = m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy of the particle.\n*   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\n### **3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe problem states that the speed of the nucleus is v = 0.96c.\n\n*   First, we find the ratio $\\beta = v/c = 0.96$.\n*   Now, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n*   The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} = \\frac{25}{7} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Rest Energy ($E_0$)**\n\nThe rest energy ($E_0 = m_0 c^2$) of the $^6$Li nucleus needs to be determined. In problems of this nature, a common and effective approximation is to calculate the mass of the nucleus by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron). Since the neutron is slightly heavier, and its mass is a common standard for such approximations, we will use the rest energy of the neutron.\n\n*   Rest energy of a neutron, $m_n c^2 \\approx 939.57 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The mass number of $^6$Li is A = 6.\n*   Approximate rest energy of the $^6$Li nucleus:\n    $E_0 \\approx A \\times (m_n c^2) = 6 \\times 939.57 \\text{ MeV} = 5637.42 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*(Note: Using a more precise value for the Li-6 nuclear mass, ~5601.4 MeV, gives a final energy of ~20.005 GeV, which does not match any of the options. This indicates that the intended method is the approximation above, which neglects the nuclear binding energy.)*\n\n### **5. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n\nNow, we combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy to find the total energy.\n\n*   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n*   $E = \\frac{25}{7} \\times 5637.42 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $E \\approx 3.571428 \\times 5637.42 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20133.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### **6. Convert to GeV and Select the Answer**\n\nThe final step is to convert the energy from Mega-electron Volts (MeV) to Giga-electron Volts (GeV) and compare it with the given options.\n\n*   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $E = \\frac{20133.6}{1000} \\text{ GeV} = 20.1336 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to option B.\n\n*   A) 18.475 GeV\n*   B) 20.132 GeV\n*   C) 21.419 GeV\n*   D) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe value 20.1336 GeV matches option B (20.132 GeV) with a negligible difference, which can be attributed to the specific value used for the neutron's rest energy in the source of the question.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a Python script for a high-precision calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants based on the reasoning\nbeta = 0.96  # v/c\nmass_number_A = 6\n# Rest energy of a neutron in MeV (a standard, precise value)\nneutron_rest_energy_MeV = 939.56542\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the approximate rest energy of the Li-6 nucleus\n# by neglecting binding energy\nE0_MeV = mass_number_A * neutron_rest_energy_MeV\n\n# Calculate the total relativistic energy in MeV\nE_MeV = gamma * E0_MeV\n\n# Convert the final energy to GeV\nE_GeV = E_MeV / 1000\n\nprint(f\"The calculated total energy is: {E_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated total energy is: 20.1335 GeV\n\nThe code output confirms that the calculated energy is approximately 20.134 GeV, which aligns with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The total relativistic energy (E) of a particle is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma \\cdot m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy of the particle.\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the nucleus and its properties.**\nThe nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   So, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as $v = 0.96c$.\n*   The ratio $\\beta = v/c = 0.96$.\n*   Now, we calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the rest energy ($m_0 c^2$) of the nucleus.**\nThe rest energy of the $^6$Li nucleus is the sum of the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy. For an approximate calculation, we can multiply the mass number (A) by the average rest energy of a nucleon (proton or neutron). The rest energy of a proton is ~938.27 MeV, and for a neutron, it is ~939.57 MeV. We can use an average or a representative value like the neutron's rest energy for this calculation.\n*   Mass number (A) = 6.\n*   Using the neutron's rest energy ($m_n c^2 \\approx 939.57$ MeV) as a good approximation for a nucleon's rest energy.\n*   Approximate rest energy of $^6$Li:\n    $E_0 = m_0 c^2 \\approx 6 \\times 939.57 \\text{ MeV} = 5637.42 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps.\n*   $E = \\gamma \\cdot E_0$\n*   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5637.42 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20133.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Step 5: Convert the energy to GeV.**\nTo compare with the options, we convert MeV to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n*   $E = \\frac{20133.6}{1000} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.134 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is very close to option B. The small discrepancy arises from the precise value used for the nucleon rest energy in the problem's formulation. The calculation performed by the Python script, `20.1335 GeV`, also confirms this result.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe value 20.134 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
