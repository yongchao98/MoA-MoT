    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O).**\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   Since B is D₂O, this means precipitate G is a compound that loses heavy water upon heating. This is characteristic of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a deuteroxide) which dehydrates (or \"de-deuterates\") to form a metal oxide and water. For example, 2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O. So, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X and Y:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms\".\n        *   We know G is a metal deuteroxide precipitate. This suggests X is a metal-containing compound.\n        *   The violent reaction and formation of a deuteroxide points to Y being D₂O (heavy water), reacting with a highly reactive substance X.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W:** \"gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   The reaction is between a substance X containing a heavy isotope and heavy water (Y=D₂O). A likely gas produced is a form of hydrogen. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n            *   H₂ (protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n            *   D₂ (deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). **(Equal)**\n            *   T₂ (tritium gas): 2 protons, 4 neutrons. (Not equal)\n            *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Not equal)\n        *   Thus, **Gas W must be D₂.**\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Identity of X:** We know X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate. This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydride. The reaction would be: Metal-D + D₂O → Metal-OD + D₂.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃-CO-COOH) contains a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces this to a product with 2 oxygen atoms is a reduction to a diol (e.g., CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)).\n        *   This type of strong reduction (reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid) is characteristic of powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its less powerful analog, Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), typically does not reduce carboxylic acids.\n        *   \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent. Its analog containing a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n        *   Let's test LiAlD₄. The reaction with D₂O would be: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂.\n        *   This reaction is violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It produces a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This fits all the clues perfectly.\n        *   If we had considered Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), the reaction NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4 D₂ would not produce a precipitate, as Boric Deuteroxide (B(OD)₃) is soluble.\n        *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are:\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), Atomic Number = 1\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule. The formula is LiAlD₄.\n        *   Number of atoms of the heaviest element (Al) = 1.\n        *   Number of atoms of the lightest element (H) = 4 (in the form of the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We use the integer mass numbers for the most common/stable isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 u.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 u.\n    *   The calculation is: (Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n        *   = 27 + (4 × 2)\n        *   = 27 + 8\n        *   = 35\n\nTo verify the simple arithmetic:\n```python\n# Mass number of the heaviest element's isotope (Aluminum-27)\nmass_heaviest = 27\n# Mass number of the lightest element's isotope (Deuterium, H-2)\nmass_lightest_isotope = 2\n# Number of atoms of the heaviest element in LiAlD4\ncount_heaviest = 1\n# Number of atoms of the lightest element in LiAlD4\ncount_lightest = 4\n# Calculate the total cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = (mass_heaviest * count_heaviest) + (mass_lightest_isotope * count_lightest)\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n>>>\n35\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction process to identify the unknown substances based on the chemical properties and reactions described.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of regular water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very strong match, so we can conclude that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G and Y:** The problem states that a precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide dehydrating (or in this case, \"de-deuterating\") to form a metal oxide and heavy water. For example: M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O. Therefore, G is a metal deuteroxide. G is formed from the reaction of substance X with liquid Y. Since the products (G and B) contain deuterium, it is logical to assume that the reactant **liquid Y is also heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction between X and Y (D₂O) releases a gas W whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze potential gases:\n    *   H₂ (Protium gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description.\n    *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): The common ¹⁴N isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This is a possibility.\n    *   O₂ (Oxygen gas): The common ¹⁶O isotope has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. An O₂ molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. This is also a possibility.\n    *   However, the reaction involves a substance X reacting with heavy water (D₂O) to form a metal deuteroxide (G). The most chemically plausible gas to be released in such a reaction is a form of hydrogen gas. The reaction of a metal deuteride with heavy water (MD + D₂O → MOD + D₂) produces D₂ gas. Therefore, **W is Deuterium gas (D₂) **.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We have established that X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide (G). This points to X being a metal deuteride.\n    *   The clue \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\" is critical. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the product to 2 oxygen atoms implies the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH). This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common laboratory reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very strong and common reducing agent capable of reducing carboxylic acids. Its \"close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium, D).\n        *   Its reaction with D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑.\n        *   This reaction is violent.\n        *   It releases D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n        *   Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent for the keto acid reaction.\n    *   All clues are satisfied. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum, ²⁷Al) = 27. There is 1 Al atom.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's isotope (Deuterium, ²H or D) = 2. There are 4 D atoms.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D) = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Mass number of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al-27)\nmass_of_heaviest_element = 27\n# Mass number of the lightest element's isotope, Deuterium (H-2)\nmass_of_lightest_element_isotope = 2\n# Number of heaviest element atoms in LiAlD4\ncount_of_heaviest = 1\n# Number of lightest element atoms in LiAlD4\ncount_of_lightest = 4\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = (mass_of_heaviest_element * count_of_heaviest) + (mass_of_lightest_element_isotope * count_of_lightest)\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n>>>\n35\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The step-by-step thinking process has led to the identification of the substances and the final calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is ~3.85 °C. This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, indicating that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance Y, G, and the Reaction Type:** Since B (D₂O) is produced by heating a precipitate G, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating. G is formed in a reaction between substance X and a liquid Y. Given that all products contain deuterium, the liquid reactant **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is violent, suggesting X is a highly reactive substance.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released from the reaction and its molecules have an equal number of neutrons and protons. The reaction is between a deuterated substance X and D₂O. The most plausible gaseous product is a form of hydrogen.\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Unequal)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We now know that X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate (G). This is the characteristic reaction of a metal deuteride.\n    *   `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\n    *   The clue about organic chemistry provides the final piece. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. Reducing it to a product with 2 oxygens requires reducing the carboxylic acid group, a reaction that needs a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (deuterium) is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`. This matches all observations: it's a violent reaction, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G), which upon heating gives D₂O (B).\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass:** The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. It contains one Aluminum atom and four Deuterium atoms.\n    *   We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum atom (²⁷Al) = 27 u.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium atom (²H) = 2 u.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
