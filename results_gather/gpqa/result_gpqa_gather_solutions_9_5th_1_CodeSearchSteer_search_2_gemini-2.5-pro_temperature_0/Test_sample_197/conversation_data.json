The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, which all candidate answers unanimously agree upon, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant, β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant, β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant, β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant, β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: The term corresponding to the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt-containing species.\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0, where β₀=1): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage Calculation**:\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption, made by all candidate answers, is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), so only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed.\n2.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation mentioned above.\n3.  **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1) and is essential for calculating the correct total concentration of all cobalt species.\n4.  **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation itself. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**.

Finally, I will compare the calculated result to the multiple-choice options provided in the original question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n2.  **Formula**: The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (n=2) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, as agreed upon by all candidate answers, is:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Careful Points & Assumptions**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, we will use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself. The percentage distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.

The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. A key and valid assumption is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration. This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed in complex formation.\n*   **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the formula. Its primary purpose is to justify the ligand concentration assumption mentioned above.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator.

This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` relative to the total cobalt concentration. This percentage is equivalent to the mole fraction of the species (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation**: The mole fraction of the nth complex, αₙ, in a series of mononuclear complexes is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n    For our specific case, we want to find α₂ for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where the ligand [L] is thiocyanate [SCN⁻]. The formula becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    The '1' in the denominator represents the free Co²⁺ ion (for which β₀ = 1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Concentrations**:\n    *   Total Cobalt, c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n    *   Total Thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A standard and valid assumption in coordination chemistry is that if the total ligand concentration is in large excess of the total metal ion concentration (here, 0.1 M is 10 times greater than 0.01 M), the amount of ligand consumed by complexation is negligible. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total ligand concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. The total cobalt concentration is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation but is crucial for justifying this assumption.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: The calculation was performed using the Python script in the previous step. The code interpreter executed the script and returned the result.\n    *   **Code Input**: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16, [SCN⁻]=0.1\n    *   **Code Calculation**: The script calculated the numerator (0.4) and the denominator (2.3646), found the mole fraction (≈0.16916), and converted it to a percentage.\n    *   **Code Output**: `16.9`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.

Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration as described above. The *percentage* distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is essential to include the term '1' in the denominator.

All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%.

There is a clear consensus among all candidate answers on this calculation, which confirms its accuracy.\n\n*   **Given Values**:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation**: This term corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex.\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation**: This is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species.\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0, β₀=1): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation**:\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption, made by all candidate answers, is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the total ligand concentration is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal ion concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`).\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (where β₀ = 1) and is essential for accounting for all cobalt-containing species. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation itself. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**.

Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in an equilibrium mixture is determined by its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. For the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, which all candidate answers unanimously identified and used, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\nA thorough review of the candidate answers reveals a consensus on several critical points required for an accurate solution:\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. A key and valid assumption is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration assumption mentioned above.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1) and is necessary to account for all cobalt-containing species. All candidates correctly included this term.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers, despite having different final letter choices, correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. The discrepancies in the final letter choices were due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent. This provides very high confidence in the calculation itself.\n\n**4.

This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed in complex formation.\n*   **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the formula. Its primary purpose is to justify the ligand concentration assumption mentioned above.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1) and is essential for calculating the correct total concentration of all cobalt species.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the formula, made the correct assumptions, and performed the calculation, arriving at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation itself.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the α₂ fraction (the term for the desired complex):\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator, which represents all possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms to find the total relative concentration:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` relative to the total cobalt concentration. This percentage is equivalent to the mole fraction of the species (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation**: The mole fraction of the nth complex, αₙ, in a series of mononuclear complexes is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n    For our specific case, we want to find α₂ for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where the ligand [L] is thiocyanate [SCN⁻]. The formula becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    The '1' in the denominator represents the free Co²⁺ ion (for which β₀ = 1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Concentrations**:\n    *   Total Cobalt, c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n    *   Total Thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A standard and valid assumption in coordination chemistry is that if the total ligand concentration is in large excess of the total metal ion concentration (here, 0.1 M is 10 times greater than 0.01 M), the amount of ligand consumed by complexation is negligible. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total ligand concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. The total cobalt concentration is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation but is crucial for justifying this assumption.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: The calculation was performed using the Python script in the previous step. The code interpreter executed the script and returned the result.\n    *   **Code Input**: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16, [SCN⁻]=0.1\n    *   **Code Calculation**: The script calculated the numerator (0.4) and the denominator (2.3646), found the mole fraction (≈0.16916), and converted it to a percentage.\n    *   **Code Output**: `16.9`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.

The correct formula, which all candidate answers unanimously agree upon, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\nA thorough analysis of the candidate answers reveals a consensus on several critical points that ensure the accuracy of the result:\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A key and valid assumption is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the total ligand concentration is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal ion concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed by complex formation.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration assumption mentioned above.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (where β₀ is defined as 1) and is essential for accounting for all cobalt-containing species. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n**4. Calculation**\nThe calculation is performed by substituting the given values into the formula. All candidate answers, including the one using a Python script, performed this calculation correctly.\n\n*   **Given Values**:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation** (for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species):\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation** (sum of terms for all species):\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation**:\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of approximately **16.9%**.

Since the total ligand concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.
