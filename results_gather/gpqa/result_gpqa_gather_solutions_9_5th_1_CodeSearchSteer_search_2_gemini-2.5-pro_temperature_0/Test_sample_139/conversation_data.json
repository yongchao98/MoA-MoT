The problem is a chemical puzzle that, when solved step-by-step, reveals the identities of the unknown substances, leading to a final calculation. The reasoning across all agents is sound, with minor discrepancies only in mapping the final numerical answer to the lettered options, likely due to variations in the options presented to each agent.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and not normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This confirms that **Substance B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly. The described reaction sequence (violent reaction with D₂O, production of D₂ gas, and a precipitate that yields D₂O upon heating) is entirely consistent with the chemistry of LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is correctly ignored for this calculation.\n    *   **Summation of Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of the stable Aluminum (²⁷Al) isotope. The mass number of Aluminum is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (protons), not atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13) are chosen, while Lithium (Z=3) is ignored.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* instances of the relevant elements is critical. The calculation must include all four Deuterium atoms.\n*   **Use of Isotope Mass**: The calculation requires using the mass number of the specific isotope (Deuterium, mass=2), not the average atomic mass of hydrogen from the periodic table.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping**: The calculated numerical answer, 35, must be correctly matched to the options provided in the original question: A) 29, B) 25, C) 35, D) 31.\n\nThe correct calculation yields 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identification of the Substances**:\n    *   **Substance B & Heavier Isotope**: The clue that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\" (approximately 3.85 °C) is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **Substance B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the definitive identification of **Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire reaction sequence `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is chemically sound and consistent with all the clues provided.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2.

The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium. Any other interpretation would make the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* instances of the relevant atoms is critical. The calculation must include all four Deuterium atoms (4 x 2), not just one.\n*   **Use of Isotope Mass Numbers**: The problem implies the use of integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the original list of options provided in the question: A) 25, B) 29, C) 35, D) 31.

It is described as a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, capable of reducing a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol). This, along with the clue about its \"very close analog\" being a common reagent, points to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the very common and powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n\n4.  **Reaction Verification**: The described reaction sequence is consistent with X being LiAlD₄. The violent reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` produces the correct gas (W) and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide), which upon heating would release heavy water (B).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation**\n\nThe final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number)**: Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number)**: Aluminum (Atomic Number Z=13).\n*   **Mass Summation**: The calculation must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the specific isotope mass numbers.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms, each with a mass number of 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom, with a mass number of 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of substance B (277 K) is the most critical piece of information. Misinterpreting it as normal water would make the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The determination of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, so Lithium (Z=3) is correctly excluded from the calculation.\n*   **Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotopes involved (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation of All Atoms**: The problem requires summing the mass of *all* atoms of the specified elements. It is crucial to account for the four Deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated number, 35, must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter in the provided options.\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to the value 35. Based on the options provided in the question (A) 31, B) 35, C) 25, D) 29), the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Clues to Identify the Substances**\n    *   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and not normal water (0 °C). This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the only logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X: it contains Deuterium, it is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry with a common non-deuterated analog, and it can reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens. This points directly to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated version of the common and powerful reagent, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire described reaction sequence is chemically consistent with X being LiAlD₄ reacting violently with Y (D₂O) to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G (Al(OD)₃), which upon heating releases B (D₂O).\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is determined by the lowest atomic number (Z). This is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is determined by the highest atomic number. This is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D), each with a mass number of 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of Aluminum (Al), with a mass number of 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The final cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium. Any other interpretation makes the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their **atomic number** (number of protons), not their atomic mass. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of \"all the heavier and lighter isotopes\" means accounting for the stoichiometry within the molecule. It is critical to include all four Deuterium atoms in the calculation.\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the integer **mass number** of the specific isotopes involved (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the specific list of options provided in the question. The options are A) 35, B) 29, C) 31, D) 25.\n\nThe analysis consistently identifies the substance as LiAlD₄ and the calculation correctly yields a result of 35. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is a chemical puzzle. The candidate answers unanimously and correctly deduce the identities of the key substances through a logical analysis of the clues.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and not normal water (0 °C). This correctly identifies **Substance B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, capable of reducing a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a diol (2 oxygens).\n    *   It has a \"very close analog\" that is also a common reagent.\n    *   These clues definitively identify Substance X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the very common and powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n\n4.  **Verification of the Reaction**: The entire reaction sequence is chemically consistent. The violent reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with D₂O (Y) produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Heating this precipitate G would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (B).\n\n5.  **Calculation**: The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   **Summation of Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D), each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of Aluminum (Al), with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O (heavy water), which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium.\n2.  **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (protons), not atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13) are chosen, while Lithium (Z=3) is correctly excluded from the final calculation.\n3.  **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of \"all\" instances of the relevant elements is critical. The calculation must include all four Deuterium atoms, not just one.\n4.  **Use of Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation must use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n5.  **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter from the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield a value of 35. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, a definitive solution can be reached. The reasoning across all candidate answers is remarkably consistent, pointing to a single correct chemical interpretation and calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of the Heavy Isotope and Key Substances**:\n    *   The clue that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (approximately 3.85 °C) is the most critical piece of information. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **Substance B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   With Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron) identified, the gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons, is logically identified as **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons per molecule.\n    *   Substance X contains Deuterium, is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry (capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol), and has a common non-deuterated analog. These clues converge on the identity of **Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated version of the common reagent LiAlH₄. The described reaction sequence is entirely consistent with the chemistry of LiAlD₄ reacting with D₂O.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Mass**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements, using the specific isotopes present: four atoms of Deuterium (mass number = 2) and one atom of Aluminum (mass number = 27).\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (4 × Mass of Deuterium) + (1 × Mass of Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n3.  **Matching the Result to the Options**:\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   The options provided in the question are: A) 35, B) 25, C) 29, D) 31.\n    *   The calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly interpreting the melting point of ~277 K as belonging to heavy water (D₂O), which definitively identifies the isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Defining \"Lightest\" and \"Heaviest\"**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their **atomic number (Z)**, not their atomic mass. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13) for the calculation, excluding Lithium (Z=3).\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction \"cumulative atomic masses\" and \"all instances\" means the stoichiometry within the molecule must be respected. It is critical to sum the masses of all **four** Deuterium atoms, not just one.\n*   **Using Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation must use the integer mass number of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Option Mapping**: The final calculated numerical value must be carefully matched to the correct lettered option from the original question's list. While the candidate answers all correctly calculated the value 35, they showed confusion about the option list. The list provided in the question is the only one that matters.\n\nThe analysis consistently identifies the substance as LiAlD₄ and the cumulative mass as 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance based on the provided clues.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The most direct and crucial clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a near-perfect match, which strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem as **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, giving it a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent that has been deuterated.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This signifies a powerful reduction reaction that converts both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into alcohol groups (-OH).\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verify the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄. The violent reaction with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to produce D₂ gas) would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When heated, the precipitate G decomposes to release D₂O (B). This entire sequence is chemically consistent and confirms the identities of all substances.\n\n### **Step 2: Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is not included in the calculation.\n*   **Sum the Masses:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains **four** atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains **one** atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Now, we match this result to the provided options in the question:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 31\nD) 35\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle. The reasoning is robust and consistent.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substances**:\n    *   **Substance B & Heavier Isotope**: The clue that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (approximately 3.85 °C) is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength.

This is the key that unlocks the entire puzzle.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass or position in the chemical formula. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The problem asks for the \"cumulative\" mass and to sum the masses of \"all\" instances of the elements. This means the stoichiometry within the molecule must be used (i.e., all four Deuterium atoms must be included in the sum).\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Average Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the integer mass number of the specific isotope involved (Deuterium, mass number = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table (e.g., ~1.008 for Hydrogen).\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated numerical value (35) must be carefully matched to the corresponding letter in the specific list of options provided in the question.

Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13) are chosen, while Lithium (Z=3) is correctly excluded from the calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule:** The calculation must include the mass of *all* atoms of the specified elements (i.e., all four deuterium atoms).\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight:** The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope (Deuterium, mass=2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table.\n*   **Option Mapping:** A common error among the candidate answers was misremembering the list of options. The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly mapped to the original list provided in the question prompt.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance based on the provided clues.\n\n1.  **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K is approximately 3.85 °C (since 0 °C = 273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This near-perfect match strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a common deuterated reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Reaction Sequence**:\n    *   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is consistent with all clues. It is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Heating the precipitate G would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (B).\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **Step 2: Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is not included in the calculation.\n*   **Sum the Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains **four** atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: The molecule contains **one** atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly interpreting the melting point of ~277 K as belonging to heavy water (D₂O). This identifies the heavy isotope as Deuterium and unlocks the rest of the puzzle.\n2.  **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the \"lightest\" and \"heaviest\" elements must be based on their atomic number (Z), not their atomic mass or position in the chemical formula. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n3.  **Summation Rule**: The instruction to calculate the \"cumulative\" mass and sum the masses of \"all\" instances of the elements is critical. The calculation must include all four Deuterium atoms (4 x 2), not just one.\n4.  **Isotope Mass vs. Average Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the integer mass number of the specific isotope involved (Deuterium, mass number = 2; Aluminum, mass number = 27), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n5.  **Option Mapping**: The final calculated value of 35 must be carefully matched to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield the value 35.

This correctly identifies **B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the definitive identification of X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire reaction sequence `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is chemically sound and consistent with all clues.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum, with a mass number of 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (number of protons), not atomic mass. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of \"all\" instances of the relevant atoms is critical. The calculation must include all four Deuterium atoms, not just one.\n*   **Use of Mass Numbers**: The problem implies the use of integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping**: The calculated numerical answer, 35, must be correctly matched to the options provided in the question: A) 25, B) 35, C) 31, D) 29.\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield a value of 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, a consistent and logical solution emerges. The problem is a chemical puzzle that, when solved step-by-step, reveals the identities of the unknown substances, leading to a final calculation.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Substances**\n\nThe core of the problem is to correctly identify the unknown substances based on the chemical clues provided.\n\n1.  **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most definitive clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, not normal water (0 °C). This confirms that **Substance B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The clue that gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. Each Deuterium atom (²H) has one proton and one neutron, so a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: With the knowledge that Deuterium is involved, Substance X can be identified. It is described as a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, capable of reducing a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol). This, along with the clue about its \"very close analog\" being a common reagent, points to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the very common and powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n\n4.  **Reaction Verification**: The described reaction sequence is consistent with X being LiAlD₄. The violent reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` produces the correct gas (W) and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide), which upon heating would release heavy water (B).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation**\n\nThe final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number)**: Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number)**: Aluminum (Atomic Number Z=13).\n*   **Mass Summation**: The calculation must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the specific isotope mass numbers.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms, each with a mass number of 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom, with a mass number of 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of substance B (277 K) is the most critical piece of information. Misinterpreting it as normal water would make the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The determination of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, so Lithium (Z=3) is correctly excluded from the calculation.\n*   **Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotopes involved (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation of All Atoms**: The problem requires summing the mass of *all* atoms of the specified elements. It is crucial to account for the four Deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated number, 35, must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter in the provided options.\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to the value 35.

This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **Substance B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   With Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron) identified, the gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons, is logically identified as **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons per molecule.\n    *   Substance X contains Deuterium, is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry (capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol), and has a common non-deuterated analog.

While the candidate answers all correctly calculated the value 35, they showed confusion about the option list. The list provided in the question is the only one that matters.\n\nThe analysis consistently identifies the substance as LiAlD₄ and the cumulative mass as 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance based on the provided clues.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The most direct and crucial clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a near-perfect match, which strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem as **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, giving it a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent that has been deuterated.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This signifies a powerful reduction reaction that converts both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into alcohol groups (-OH).\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verify the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄. The violent reaction with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to produce D₂ gas) would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When heated, the precipitate G decomposes to release D₂O (B). This entire sequence is chemically consistent and confirms the identities of all substances.\n\n### **Step 2: Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is not included in the calculation.\n*   **Sum the Masses:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains **four** atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains **one** atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Now, we match this result to the provided options in the question:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 31\nD) 35\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle. The reasoning is robust and consistent.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substances**:\n    *   **Substance B & Heavier Isotope**: The clue that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (approximately 3.85 °C) is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the definitive identification of X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire reaction sequence `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is chemically sound and consistent with all clues.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum, with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The most crucial step is correctly interpreting the melting point of ~277 K as belonging to heavy water (D₂O), not normal water. This is the key that unlocks the entire puzzle.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass or position in the chemical formula. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The problem asks for the \"cumulative\" mass and to sum the masses of \"all\" instances of the elements. This means the stoichiometry within the molecule must be used (i.e., all four Deuterium atoms must be included in the sum).\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Average Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the integer mass number of the specific isotope involved (Deuterium, mass number = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table (e.g., ~1.008 for Hydrogen).\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated numerical value (35) must be carefully matched to the corresponding letter in the specific list of options provided in the question. The candidate answers showed variation in their final letter choice only because the options were shuffled in their prompts.\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield a value of 35. Based on the options provided in the question (A) 35, B) 25, C) 31, D) 29), the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, as opposed to normal water (H₂O) which melts at 0 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X**: Several clues converge to identify Substance X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a common chemical and its deuterated version.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. The classic reagent for this is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Therefore, the deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues. The described reaction sequence (violent reaction with D₂O, production of D₂ gas, and a precipitate that yields D₂O upon heating) is entirely consistent with the chemistry of LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is correctly excluded from the calculation.\n    *   **Sum the Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number of Al is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element Definition**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (number of protons), not atomic mass. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3).\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* instances of the relevant elements is critical. The calculation must account for all four Deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the integer mass number of the specific isotopes involved (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated numerical answer, 35, must be correctly matched to the options provided in the original question: A) 29, B) 25, C) 31, D) 35. The calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance through the clues provided. The consensus among the candidate answers follows a clear and logical path.\n\n1.  **Identification of the Substances**:\n    *   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".

A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X contains Deuterium, is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (with 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the definitive identification of **Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire described reaction sequence is chemically sound with these identifications: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction is violent, produces the correct gas (W), and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide), which upon heating would release heavy water (B).\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**. Its constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2.

The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium. Any other interpretation would make the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass.
