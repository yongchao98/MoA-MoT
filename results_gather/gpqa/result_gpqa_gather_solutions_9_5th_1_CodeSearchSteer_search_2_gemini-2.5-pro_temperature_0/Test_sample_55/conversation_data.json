The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The E1 Selection Rules**\nThe entire process is governed by the strict quantum mechanical selection rules for E1 transitions. A transition is only \"allowed\" if the quantum numbers change as follows:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The decay rule requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, that state must have $l'=1$ (so that $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The decay rule requires $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify the Intermediate State**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), we find that the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states, corresponding to the degenerate 2p subshell:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nThis confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State**\nThis is the most crucial insight for solving the problem. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. Physically, this means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction or final orientation over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available and degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculating the Branching Ratio and Total Probability**\n*   **Probability of the first step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- The route is valid (ignoring the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **The route is valid, and the probability matches our calculation.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Physical Process and Governing Rules\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.

To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify Possible Paths**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), we find that the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states, corresponding to the degenerate 2p subshell:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nThis confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State is Key**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A crucial property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, which means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction or final orientation over another. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation. Therefore, the atom is **equally likely** to transition into any of them.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculating the Branching Ratio and Total Probability**\n*   **Probability of the first step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this transition is **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

This will allow me to select the correct choice from the given options.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the Governing Rules:** The problem involves electric dipole (E1) transitions. I will state the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, and $\\Delta n < 0$ for decay).\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** I will apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$ and $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) to find the quantum numbers of the necessary intermediate state.\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability:** The most critical step is to calculate the probability. I will use the spherical symmetry of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to argue that the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability is split equally among all possible intermediate states.

This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules.** The entire process is governed by a strict set of quantum mechanical rules for E1 transitions. Any valid transition path must obey:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify All Possible Paths.** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is to calculate the probability of one specific route. The probability of the cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, meaning the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Applying the Principle of Isotropic Decay.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculating the Branching Ratio and Total Probability.**\n*   Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, and these are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific** path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is **1**. This is because, from the 2p level, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the 1s ground state.\n*   Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $1/3$.

The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$.

A key physical property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric. This means the atom's electron cloud has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available and degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$).

This means the atom must pass through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules.**\nEach of the two transitions must independently obey the strict quantum mechanical selection rules for E1 transitions. A transition is \"allowed\" only if the quantum numbers change as follows:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify All Possible Paths.**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states, all belonging to the degenerate 2p subshell:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nThis confirms that the transition routes listed in all the options are physically possible. The deciding factor must be the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two individual steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State is Key.**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A fundamental property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, which means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities.**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction or final orientation ($m'$) over another. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). Therefore, the atom is **equally likely** to transition into any of them.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculating the Branching Ratio and Total Probability.**\n*   **Probability of the first step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **The route is valid, and the probability matches our calculation.**\n\n<<<D>>>"

The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The E1 Selection Rules**\nThe entire process is governed by the strict quantum mechanical selection rules for E1 transitions. A transition is only \"allowed\" if the quantum numbers change as follows:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The decay rule requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, that state must have $l'=1$ (so that $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The decay rule requires $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify the Intermediate State**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), we find that the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states, corresponding to the degenerate 2p subshell:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nThis confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State**\nThis is the most crucial insight for solving the problem. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. Physically, this means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction or final orientation over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available and degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculating the Branching Ratio and Total Probability**\n*   **Probability of the first step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- The route is valid (ignoring the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **The route is valid, and the probability matches our calculation.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Physical Process and Governing Rules\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.

The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nThe entire process is governed by a strict set of quantum mechanical rules for E1 transitions. Any valid transition path must obey:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify All Possible Paths**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states, corresponding to the degenerate 2p subshell:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\nThis confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State is Key**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$).

The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules.** The entire process is governed by a strict set of quantum mechanical rules for E1 transitions. Any valid transition path must obey:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify All Possible Paths.** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is to calculate the probability of one specific route. The probability of the cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, meaning the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Applying the Principle of Isotropic Decay.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculating the Branching Ratio and Total Probability.**\n*   Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, and these are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific** path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is **1**. This is because, from the 2p level, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the 1s ground state.\n*   Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $1/3$.

Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n**Careful Point 6: Calculating the Total Probability.** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that pairs a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
