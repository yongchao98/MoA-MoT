  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the problem, the following is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Quantify the Decomposition Products:** The first step is to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products from the experimental data.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:** Using the law of conservation of mass, we can find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical clue. It means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio corresponding to the molar ratio we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n        *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n        *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n    *   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n        *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n        *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n    *   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The analysis hinges on correctly applying the conservation of mass to deduce the elemental composition of the initial mixture from its decomposition products. A mass balance check (0.40g H + 2.80g N + 4.00g O = 7.20g) confirms the calculations.\n*   **\"Equimolar\" Constraint:** This is the key to solving the problem. It allows us to combine the elemental ratios into a single target formula (N₄H₈O₅) for one unit of each salt combined.\n*   **Correct Interpretation of the Question:** The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts (one molecule of each), not the total atoms in the 7.20 g sample.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated numerical answer is 17. It is crucial to match this number to the correct multiple-choice option provided in the original question.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nOur calculated result of 17 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, the following step-by-step solution determines the final answer. The chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistent; the discrepancies arise only from matching the final number to differently ordered multiple-choice options.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Molar Quantities**\nThe first step is to interpret the experimental data to determine the identity and amount of each gaseous product formed upon heating the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to identifying the salts. It means the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Checking the sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **No Acidic Gas:** The fact that the weight of Tube №2 did not change is a critical clue that eliminates elements like carbon and sulfur from the original salts.\n*   **Equimolar Condition:** This is the most important constraint. It allows us to determine the combined chemical formula (N₄H₈O₅) for one unit of each salt together, which is essential for identifying them.\n*   **Mass Verification:** Checking that the mass of the calculated elements (0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, 0.25 mol O) adds up to the initial 7.20 g confirms that the analysis of the products is correct and complete.\n*   **Sources of Oxygen:** It is crucial to account for oxygen from both the water (0.20 mol) and the gas that reacted with copper (0.05 mol) to get the correct total amount of oxygen (0.25 mol).\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently leads to the conclusion that the two salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). The total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning and calculations. The core logic is consistent and sound across all solutions. The discrepancies only appear in the final step of matching the calculated number to a lettered option, likely because each agent was presented with a differently ordered list of choices.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem, incorporating the careful points required for an accurate answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Quantify the Decomposition Products:** The first step is to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products from the experimental data.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Cu):** This tube reacts with gaseous oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted to form CuO.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:** Using the law of conservation of mass, we can find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen comes from the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts using the Equimolar Condition:** The problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to the solution. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n        *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n        *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n    *   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n        *   Salt A: **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   Salt B: **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Checking the sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting the Data:** It is crucial to correctly identify what each tube's mass change represents: Tube 1 is H₂O, Tube 2's lack of change rules out acidic gases, and Tube 3 is O atoms.\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The entire analysis relies on correctly tracing the atoms from the products back to the original reactants. The mass balance check (0.40g H + 2.80g N + 4.00g O = 7.20g) confirms this was done correctly.\n*   **The \"Equimolar\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of information. Without it, one could only determine the empirical formula of the mixture, not the specific salts. It allows us to treat the calculated elemental ratio as the sum of two distinct molecular formulas.\n*   **Atom Counting:** When counting atoms in salts like ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), it's important to sum all atoms correctly: (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The final numerical answer, 17, must be matched to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe final calculated answer is 17.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to determine the identity and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were formed**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial piece of information. It indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur, which would form acidic oxides upon heating. The salts are likely composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness to the previous reagents and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all the atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Mass Verification):** It is essential to check if the masses of the calculated elements sum to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass, confirming the analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical clue. It means the total elemental moles we calculated came from an equal number of moles of Salt A and Salt B. Therefore, the molar ratio of elements in the combined formula unit (A + B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for one unit of Salt A plus one unit of Salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5.

The process involves determining the products of decomposition, calculating their molar quantities, deducing the elemental composition of the original mixture, identifying the salts based on the equimolar condition, and finally, counting the total atoms.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, highlighting the careful points at each stage.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\nThe first step is to interpret the experimental data to determine the identity and amount of each gaseous product.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The weight did not change. This is a critical negative result, proving that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO).

Given its inertness, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n    Using the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from Tube №3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    The problem states the mixture was **equimolar**.

This is a perfect match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms:** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Function of Reagents:** It is essential to correctly identify the purpose of each chemical in the analysis train: Mg(ClO₄)₂ for water, Ca(OH)₂ for acidic gases, and hot Cu for oxygen.\n*   **Significance of No Change:** The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change is a critical negative result, ruling out elements like carbon and sulfur.\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The entire analysis relies on this fundamental principle to link the final products back to the initial reactants. A mass balance check (calculating the mass of N, H, and O to see if it sums to 7.20 g) is a valuable way to confirm the calculations.\n*   **The \"Equimolar\" Constraint:** This is the key to solving the problem. Without it, one could only determine the empirical formula of the mixture, not the specific identities of the two salts. It allows us to treat the calculated elemental ratio as belonging to the sum of the two molecular formulas.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently and correctly leads to a total atom count of 17.

The logical path to the solution is consistent and sound across all responses. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choice (e.g., some say A, some B, some D) are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order for each agent. The calculated numerical answer, however, is consistently 17.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution to the problem, incorporating the careful points required for an accurate answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Quantify the Decomposition Products**\nThe first step is to interpret the experimental data to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products formed upon heating the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical clue. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Molar Ratio:** N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   **Simplest Integer Ratio:** To find this, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the fraction.\n    *   Dividing by 0.20 gives: 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives: **4 : 8 : 5**\n*   **Combined Formula:** The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Deduction:** We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Salt A: **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n    *   Salt B: **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n*   **Verification:** Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total Atoms** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpreting Reagent Functions:** It is essential to correctly identify the purpose of each chemical in the analysis train: Mg(ClO₄)₂ for water, Ca(OH)₂ for acidic gases, and hot Cu for oxygen.\n2.  **Significance of Negative Results:** The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change is a critical piece of data that rules out elements like Carbon and Sulfur in the original salts.\n3.  **Accounting for All Sources:** The total amount of oxygen must be calculated by summing the oxygen from the water and the oxygen that reacted with the copper. Forgetting one of these sources leads to an incorrect elemental ratio.\n4.  **The \"Equimolar\" Constraint:** This is the most important clue in the problem. It allows the transition from the overall elemental ratio of the *mixture* to the combined molecular formula of *one unit of each salt*.\n5.  **Mass Balance Verification:** A quick calculation to confirm that the masses of the derived elements (0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, 0.25 mol O) sum up to the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g) is an excellent way to check for errors in the analysis of the products.\n6.  **Answering the Specific Question:** The question asks for the total number of atoms in the two salt formulas (one of each), which is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe final calculated answer is 17.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Molar Quantities**\nThe first step is to interpret the experimental data to determine the identity and amount of each gaseous product formed upon heating the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases.

This inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to identifying the salts. It means the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Cu):** This tube reacts with gaseous oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted to form CuO.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:** Using the law of conservation of mass, we can find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen comes from the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts using the Equimolar Condition:** The problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to the solution. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n        *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n        *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n    *   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n        *   Salt A: **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   Salt B: **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Checking the sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting the Data:** It is crucial to correctly identify what each tube's mass change represents: Tube 1 is H₂O, Tube 2's lack of change rules out acidic gases, and Tube 3 is O atoms.\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The entire analysis relies on correctly tracing the atoms from the products back to the original reactants. The mass balance check (0.40g H + 2.80g N + 4.00g O = 7.20g) confirms this was done correctly.\n*   **The \"Equimolar\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of information. Without it, one could only determine the empirical formula of the mixture, not the specific salts. It allows us to treat the calculated elemental ratio as the sum of two distinct molecular formulas.\n*   **Atom Counting:** When counting atoms in salts like ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), it's important to sum all atoms correctly: (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The final numerical answer, 17, must be matched to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe final calculated answer is 17.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to determine the identity and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were formed**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial piece of information. It indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur, which would form acidic oxides upon heating. The salts are likely composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness to the previous reagents and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all the atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Mass Verification):** It is essential to check if the masses of the calculated elements sum to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass, confirming the analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical clue. It means the total elemental moles we calculated came from an equal number of moles of Salt A and Salt B. Therefore, the molar ratio of elements in the combined formula unit (A + B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for one unit of Salt A plus one unit of Salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17.

This is a critical negative result, proving that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** It is essential to account for all sources of each element in the products.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A mass balance check should be performed to validate the analysis.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass, confirming the analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The \"equimolar\" condition is the key to solving the problem. It means the calculated elemental ratio (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.

This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness and the likely elemental composition, this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in two products: the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**Step 3: Mass Balance Verification (Careful Point)**\n\nIt is crucial to check if the masses of the calculated elements sum to the initial mass of the mixture. This validates the analysis of the products.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\nThe mass matches perfectly, confirming the analysis is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identification of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to solving the problem. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio for the combined formula, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Step 5: Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the problem statement, the following is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution. The reasoning across all candidate answers is chemically sound and consistent, with minor discrepancies only in matching the final number to a lettered option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Quantify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical clue. It means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio corresponding to the molar ratio we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpreting Negative Evidence:** The lack of weight change in Tube №2 is crucial information that rules out elements like carbon and sulfur.\n2.  **Accounting for All Sources:** The total oxygen in the original mixture is the sum of the oxygen that formed water and the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n3.  **The \"Equimolar\" Condition:** This is the key that unlocks the problem, allowing the determination of the combined formula (N₄H₈O₅) from the overall elemental ratio.\n4.  **Mass Verification:** Checking that the mass of the calculated elements (0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, 0.25 mol O) adds up to the initial 7.20 g confirms the correctness of the product analysis.\n5.  **Answering the Specific Question:** The final answer must be the sum of atoms in one unit of each salt (9 + 8), not the number of atoms in the combined formula (4+8+5=17, which is coincidentally the same) or any other value.\n\nThe final calculated number of atoms is 17. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and highlighting the key points.\n\nThe core of the task is to identify two unknown salts, A and B, by analyzing the products of their thermal decomposition. Once identified, we must count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and sum them. The provided candidate answers are all in agreement on the chemical analysis, with minor differences in how they map the final number to the multiple-choice letters.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n    The gaseous mixture formed upon heating is passed through a series of analytical tubes. The changes in mass and the remaining volume allow us to determine the composition of this mixture.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent. Its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper to form CuO.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n    Using the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from Tube №3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    The problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n\n    *   **Molar Ratio:** N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   **Simplest Integer Ratio:** To find this, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear any fractions.\n        *   Dividing by 0.20 gives: 1 : 2 : 1.25\n        *   Multiplying by 4 gives: **4 : 8 : 5**\n    *   **Combined Formula:** The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   **Deduction:** We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n        *   Salt A: **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   Salt B: **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   **Check:** (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms:** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Function of Reagents:** It is essential to correctly identify the purpose of each chemical in the analysis train: Mg(ClO₄)₂ for water, Ca(OH)₂ for acidic gases, and hot Cu for oxygen.\n*   **Significance of No Change:** The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change is a critical negative result, ruling out elements like carbon and sulfur.\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The entire analysis relies on this fundamental principle to link the final products back to the initial reactants. A mass balance check (calculating the mass of N, H, and O to see if it sums to 7.20 g) is a valuable way to confirm the calculations.\n*   **The \"Equimolar\" Constraint:** This is the key to solving the problem. Without it, one could only determine the empirical formula of the mixture, not the specific identities of the two salts. It allows us to treat the calculated elemental ratio as belonging to the sum of the two molecular formulas.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently and correctly leads to a total atom count of 17. Matching this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
