The reasoning across all provided answers is remarkably consistent and leads to the same numerical conclusion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires evaluating six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability. A star is only \"detectable\" if it meets **both** criteria.\n\n**Criterion 1: Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\nThe first and most fundamental check is whether a star is physically observable from the telescope's location.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Geographic Constraint.** A star's detectability is not just about its brightness but also its position in the sky relative to the observatory. The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Calculation:** From a southern latitude, stars that are very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. These are on the celestial equator and are easily visible. **(Visible)**\n\nThis initial check immediately and definitively eliminates **Polaris**.\n\n**Criterion 2: Brightness for the ESPRESSO Instrument**\nThe second check is whether a star is bright enough for the instrument to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using the Primary Source.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. The most reliable method is to use the information directly from this source. The \"Expected S/N\" table on that page shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode) in High Resolution (HR) mode, a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16.0** yields an S/N of 10.\n*   **Brightness Threshold:** Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star must have an apparent magnitude **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** The problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M) for stars c, d, e, and f. This must be converted to *apparent* magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)` before it can be compared to the instrument's limit.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible AND have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.0 to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc\n3.  The star at 5 pc\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that there are 3 detectable stars.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Mapping to Options.** The final step is to match this count to the provided multiple-choice options.\n    A) 2\n    B) 5\n    C) 3\n    D) 4\n\nThe calculated number of 3 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis is required, synthesizing the correct and consistent logic from all candidate answers. The process involves evaluating each of the six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously. A failure to meet either one results in the star being undetectable.\n\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two-Step Filtering is Essential.** It is crucial to apply both the visibility and brightness filters in sequence. A star can be bright enough but not visible (like Polaris), or visible but not bright enough (like the stars at 200 pc and 50 pc). Both conditions must be met.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Visibility is a Geographic Constraint.** A star's detectability is not just about its brightness but also its position in the sky relative to the observatory.\n    *   **Location:** The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n    *   **Limit:** From a southern latitude, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole never rise above the horizon. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   **Calculation:** `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible.\n    *   **Evaluation:**\n        *   a) Canopus (DEC ≈ -52.7°): **Visible**.\n        *   b) Polaris (DEC ≈ +89.3°): **Not Visible**.\n        *   c, d, e, f) Hypothetical Stars (DEC = 0°): **Visible**.\n    *   This step definitively eliminates Polaris.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Brightness Limit Must Come from the Primary Source.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. The \"Expected S/N\" table on that page shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode) in High Resolution (HR) mode, a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16.0** yields an S/N of 10. Therefore, the brightness threshold is **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** The problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M) for stars c, d, e, and f. This must be converted to *apparent* magnitude (m or V) using the distance modulus formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)` before it can be compared to the instrument's limiting magnitude.\n    *   **Calculations:**\n        *   c) Star at 10 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n        *   d) Star at 200 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n        *   e) Star at 5 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n        *   f) Star at 50 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible and bright enough to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | **Detectable?** |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. The total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Mapping the Count to the Correct Option.** The analysis consistently shows that there are **3** detectable stars. We must now match this number to the options provided in the original question:\n    *   A) 4\n    *   B) 3\n    *   C) 2\n    *   D) 5\n\nThe calculated number of 3 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points of the evaluation.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish Detection Criteria:** I will define the two independent conditions a star must meet to be considered \"detectable\":\n    a.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory's latitude.\n    b.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO instrument to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n2.  **Analyze Visibility:** I will calculate the declination limit for Paranal and check each star.

The process involves evaluating each of the six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile. A star that never rises above the horizon cannot be detected, regardless of its brightness.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled with a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a fundamental check based on the star's position in the sky (declination, DEC) and the observatory's location on Earth (latitude).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observatory Location.** The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculating the Visibility Limit.** From a location in the Southern Hemisphere, stars that are very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   Calculation: `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n    *   Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible from Paranal.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Each Star:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well below the +65.4° limit. **Visible.**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far above the +65.4° limit. **Not Visible.**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is easily **Visible.**\n\nThis step definitively eliminates Polaris from the list of detectable stars.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\nThis step requires determining the faintest apparent magnitude (V) that allows ESPRESSO to meet the S/N requirement and then calculating the apparent magnitude of each star.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Using the Provided Source.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. The most accurate approach is to use the data from this primary source. The \"Expected S/N\" table on that page shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode) in High Resolution (HR) mode, a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16** yields an S/N of 10.\n*   **Conclusion on Brightness Limit:** The brightness criterion is that a star must have an apparent magnitude **V ≤ 16.0** to be detectable.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Calculating Apparent Magnitudes.** For the hypothetical stars, we must use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where the absolute magnitude `M = 15` and `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now combine both criteria to determine which stars are detectable. A star must be both visible AND have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.0.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\n\nThe calculated number of detectable stars is 3. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 4\nC) 5\nD) 2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic analysis is required, evaluating each star against the two criteria for detectability: visibility from the observatory and sufficient brightness for the instrument.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a fundamental check based on the observatory's geographical location and the star's position in the sky.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Geographic Constraint.** A star's visibility is an absolute constraint. The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. From this location, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon.\n*   **Calculation:** The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`\n    Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible.\n*   **Evaluation of Stars:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. These are on the celestial equator and are easily **Visible.**\n\nThis step definitively eliminates **Polaris** from the list of detectable stars.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\nThis step involves determining the instrument's limiting apparent magnitude (V) and comparing each star's brightness to that limit.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using the Primary Source.** The limiting magnitude must be determined from the specific information provided in the question, which is the ESPRESSO overview link. The table under the \"Expected S/N\" section shows the performance for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode). For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with **V = 16 mag** yields an **S/N of 10**. Therefore, the brightness threshold is **V ≤ 16.0**.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** For the hypothetical stars, we are given the absolute magnitude (M=15) and must calculate their apparent magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results.

A failure to meet either one results in the star being undetectable.\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory's location in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a crucial first filter based on the star's position in the sky (declination, DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observatory Location.** The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. From this location, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculating the Visibility Limit.** The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   Calculation: `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n    *   Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible from Paranal.\n*   **Evaluation of Stars:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°.

The distance modulus formula, `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, must be used.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **c) Star at 10 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **d) Star at 200 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **e) Star at 5 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **f) Star at 50 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 5: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results.

Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star's apparent magnitude must be **V ≤ 16.0**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M) for stars c, d, e, and f.

For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with **V = 16 mag** yields an **S/N of 10**. Therefore, the brightness threshold is **V ≤ 16.0**.\n*   **Careful Point:** For the hypothetical stars, we must calculate their apparent magnitude (m) from their absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    *   **Canopus:** V = -0.74 (given).\n    *   **Star at 10 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star at 200 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star at 5 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star at 50 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible and bright enough to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | 1.98 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that there are 3 detectable stars. Matching this count to the options provided in the question:\nA) 4\nB) 5\nC) 2\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the question and the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires evaluating six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability. A star is only \"detectable\" if it meets **both** criteria.\n\n**Criterion 1: Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\nThe first, and most fundamental, check is whether a star is physically observable from the telescope's location.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Visibility is a Geographic Constraint.** A star's detectability is not just about its brightness, but also its position in the sky relative to the observatory. A star that never rises above the horizon cannot be detected.\n*   **Observatory Location:** The Paranal Observatory is located in Chile at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Calculation of Visibility Limit:** From a southern latitude, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole will never be visible. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`\n*   **Evaluation of Stars:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. These are on the celestial equator and are easily visible. **(Visible)**\n\nThis step definitively eliminates **Polaris** from the list of detectable stars.\n\n**Criterion 2: Brightness for ESPRESSO**\nThe second check is whether a star is bright enough for the instrument to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Use the Primary Source for Instrument Performance.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. This is the primary source to determine the instrument's performance.\n*   **Determining the Limiting Magnitude:** The \"Expected S/N\" table on the linked ESO page shows the instrument's performance for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode). For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16.0** yields an S/N of 10. Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star's apparent magnitude must be **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** For the hypothetical stars (c-f), the problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M=15). This must be converted to *apparent* magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula before it can be compared to the instrument's limit. The formula is `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible AND have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.0 to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | **Detectable?** |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc\n3.  The star at 5 pc\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Answer Mapping.** The final calculated number must be correctly mapped to the corresponding letter from the original question's options.\nThe calculated number of detectable stars is 3. The options provided in the question are:\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 5\n\nThe number 3 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points of the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously. A failure to meet either one results in the star being undetectable.\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory's location in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a crucial first filter based on the star's position in the sky (declination, DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Visibility is a non-negotiable geographic constraint.** A star that never rises above the horizon cannot be detected, regardless of its brightness. The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. From this location, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole are never visible. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n*   **Calculation:** `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Any star with a declination significantly higher than +65.4° is not visible.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°.

The table under the \"Expected S/N\" section for a 1-hour exposure in \"1-UT mode\" (one telescope) is the correct reference. For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with **V = 16 mag** yields an **S/N of 10**. Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star's apparent magnitude must be **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent magnitude, not absolute magnitude, is what matters.** For the hypothetical stars, we must calculate their apparent magnitude (m) from their given absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    *   **c) Star at 10 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **d) Star at 200 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **e) Star at 5 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **f) Star at 50 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results.

The reasoning across all provided answers is remarkably consistent and leads to the same numerical conclusion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires evaluating six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability. A star is only \"detectable\" if it meets **both** criteria.\n\n**Criterion 1: Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\nThe first and most fundamental check is whether a star is physically observable from the telescope's location.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Geographic Constraint.** A star's detectability is not just about its brightness but also its position in the sky relative to the observatory. The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Calculation:** From a southern latitude, stars that are very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. These are on the celestial equator and are easily visible. **(Visible)**\n\nThis initial check immediately and definitively eliminates **Polaris**.\n\n**Criterion 2: Brightness for the ESPRESSO Instrument**\nThe second check is whether a star is bright enough for the instrument to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using the Primary Source.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. The most reliable method is to use the information directly from this source. The \"Expected S/N\" table on that page shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode) in High Resolution (HR) mode, a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16.0** yields an S/N of 10.\n*   **Brightness Threshold:** Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star must have an apparent magnitude **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** The problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M) for stars c, d, e, and f. This must be converted to *apparent* magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)` before it can be compared to the instrument's limit.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible AND have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.0 to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc\n3.  The star at 5 pc\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that there are 3 detectable stars.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Mapping to Options.** The final step is to match this count to the provided multiple-choice options.\n    A) 2\n    B) 5\n    C) 3\n    D) 4\n\nThe calculated number of 3 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis is required, synthesizing the correct and consistent logic from all candidate answers. The process involves evaluating each of the six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously. A failure to meet either one results in the star being undetectable.\n\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two-Step Filtering is Essential.** It is crucial to apply both the visibility and brightness filters in sequence. A star can be bright enough but not visible (like Polaris), or visible but not bright enough (like the stars at 200 pc and 50 pc). Both conditions must be met.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Visibility is a Geographic Constraint.** A star's detectability is not just about its brightness but also its position in the sky relative to the observatory.\n    *   **Location:** The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n    *   **Limit:** From a southern latitude, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole never rise above the horizon. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   **Calculation:** `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible.\n    *   **Evaluation:**\n        *   a) Canopus (DEC ≈ -52.7°): **Visible**.\n        *   b) Polaris (DEC ≈ +89.3°): **Not Visible**.\n        *   c, d, e, f) Hypothetical Stars (DEC = 0°): **Visible**.\n    *   This step definitively eliminates Polaris.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Brightness Limit Must Come from the Primary Source.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. The \"Expected S/N\" table on that page shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode) in High Resolution (HR) mode, a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16.0** yields an S/N of 10. Therefore, the brightness threshold is **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** The problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M) for stars c, d, e, and f. This must be converted to *apparent* magnitude (m or V) using the distance modulus formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)` before it can be compared to the instrument's limiting magnitude.\n    *   **Calculations:**\n        *   c) Star at 10 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n        *   d) Star at 200 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n        *   e) Star at 5 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n        *   f) Star at 50 pc: `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible and bright enough to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | **Detectable?** |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. The total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Mapping the Count to the Correct Option.** The analysis consistently shows that there are **3** detectable stars. We must now match this number to the options provided in the original question:\n    *   A) 4\n    *   B) 3\n    *   C) 2\n    *   D) 5\n\nThe calculated number of 3 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points of the evaluation.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish Detection Criteria:** I will define the two independent conditions a star must meet to be considered \"detectable\":\n    a.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory's latitude.\n    b.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO instrument to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n2.  **Analyze Visibility:** I will calculate the declination limit for Paranal and check each star.

The process involves evaluating each of the six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile. A star that never rises above the horizon cannot be detected, regardless of its brightness.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled with a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a fundamental check based on the star's position in the sky (declination, DEC) and the observatory's location on Earth (latitude).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observatory Location.** The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculating the Visibility Limit.** From a location in the Southern Hemisphere, stars that are very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   Calculation: `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n    *   Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible from Paranal.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Each Star:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well below the +65.4° limit. **Visible.**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far above the +65.4° limit. **Not Visible.**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is easily **Visible.**\n\nThis step definitively eliminates Polaris from the list of detectable stars.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\nThis step requires determining the faintest apparent magnitude (V) that allows ESPRESSO to meet the S/N requirement and then calculating the apparent magnitude of each star.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Using the Provided Source.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. The most accurate approach is to use the data from this primary source. The \"Expected S/N\" table on that page shows that for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode) in High Resolution (HR) mode, a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16** yields an S/N of 10.\n*   **Conclusion on Brightness Limit:** The brightness criterion is that a star must have an apparent magnitude **V ≤ 16.0** to be detectable.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Calculating Apparent Magnitudes.** For the hypothetical stars, we must use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where the absolute magnitude `M = 15` and `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now combine both criteria to determine which stars are detectable. A star must be both visible AND have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.0.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\n\nThe calculated number of detectable stars is 3. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 4\nC) 5\nD) 2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic analysis is required, evaluating each star against the two criteria for detectability: visibility from the observatory and sufficient brightness for the instrument.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a fundamental check based on the observatory's geographical location and the star's position in the sky.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Geographic Constraint.** A star's visibility is an absolute constraint. The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. From this location, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon.\n*   **Calculation:** The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`\n    Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible.\n*   **Evaluation of Stars:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. These are on the celestial equator and are easily **Visible.**\n\nThis step definitively eliminates **Polaris** from the list of detectable stars.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\nThis step involves determining the instrument's limiting apparent magnitude (V) and comparing each star's brightness to that limit.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using the Primary Source.** The limiting magnitude must be determined from the specific information provided in the question, which is the ESPRESSO overview link. The table under the \"Expected S/N\" section shows the performance for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode). For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with **V = 16 mag** yields an **S/N of 10**. Therefore, the brightness threshold is **V ≤ 16.0**.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** For the hypothetical stars, we are given the absolute magnitude (M=15) and must calculate their apparent magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results.

A failure to meet either one results in the star being undetectable.\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory's location in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a crucial first filter based on the star's position in the sky (declination, DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observatory Location.** The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. From this location, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole will never rise above the horizon.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculating the Visibility Limit.** The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   Calculation: `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n    *   Therefore, any star with a declination greater than +65.4° is not visible from Paranal.\n*   **Evaluation of Stars:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°.

The distance modulus formula, `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, must be used.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **c) Star at 10 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **d) Star at 200 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **e) Star at 5 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **f) Star at 50 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 5: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results.

Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star's apparent magnitude must be **V ≤ 16.0**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M) for stars c, d, e, and f.

For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with **V = 16 mag** yields an **S/N of 10**. Therefore, the brightness threshold is **V ≤ 16.0**.\n*   **Careful Point:** For the hypothetical stars, we must calculate their apparent magnitude (m) from their absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    *   **Canopus:** V = -0.74 (given).\n    *   **Star at 10 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star at 200 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star at 5 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star at 50 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible and bright enough to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | 1.98 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that there are 3 detectable stars. Matching this count to the options provided in the question:\nA) 4\nB) 5\nC) 2\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the question and the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires evaluating six stars against two distinct criteria for detectability. A star is only \"detectable\" if it meets **both** criteria.\n\n**Criterion 1: Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\nThe first, and most fundamental, check is whether a star is physically observable from the telescope's location.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Visibility is a Geographic Constraint.** A star's detectability is not just about its brightness, but also its position in the sky relative to the observatory. A star that never rises above the horizon cannot be detected.\n*   **Observatory Location:** The Paranal Observatory is located in Chile at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Calculation of Visibility Limit:** From a southern latitude, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole will never be visible. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n    *   `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`\n*   **Evaluation of Stars:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°. These are on the celestial equator and are easily visible. **(Visible)**\n\nThis step definitively eliminates **Polaris** from the list of detectable stars.\n\n**Criterion 2: Brightness for ESPRESSO**\nThe second check is whether a star is bright enough for the instrument to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Use the Primary Source for Instrument Performance.** The question provides a specific link to the ESPRESSO overview page. This is the primary source to determine the instrument's performance.\n*   **Determining the Limiting Magnitude:** The \"Expected S/N\" table on the linked ESO page shows the instrument's performance for a 1-hour exposure with one telescope (1-UT mode). For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with an apparent magnitude of **V = 16.0** yields an S/N of 10. Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star's apparent magnitude must be **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** For the hypothetical stars (c-f), the problem provides the *absolute* magnitude (M=15). This must be converted to *apparent* magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula before it can be compared to the instrument's limit. The formula is `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Star c (10 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **Star d (200 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **Star e (5 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **Star f (50 pc):** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results. A star must be both visible AND have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.0 to be detectable.\n\n| Star | Visible from Paranal? | Apparent Mag (V) | Bright Enough (V ≤ 16.0)? | **Detectable?** |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| a) Canopus | **Yes** | -0.74 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| b) Polaris | **No** | ~2.0 | (Irrelevant) | **No** |\n| c) Star at 10 pc | **Yes** | 15.0 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| d) Star at 200 pc | **Yes** | ~21.5 | **No** | **No** |\n| e) Star at 5 pc | **Yes** | ~13.5 | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| f) Star at 50 pc | **Yes** | ~18.5 | **No** | **No** |\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc\n3.  The star at 5 pc\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is **3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Answer Mapping.** The final calculated number must be correctly mapped to the corresponding letter from the original question's options.\nThe calculated number of detectable stars is 3. The options provided in the question are:\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 5\n\nThe number 3 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points of the evaluation.\n\n### **Step 1: Establish the Detection Criteria**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if it meets two independent conditions simultaneously. A failure to meet either one results in the star being undetectable.\n1.  **Visibility Criterion:** The star must be physically observable from the Paranal Observatory's location in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, on a single 8m VLT, to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThis is a crucial first filter based on the star's position in the sky (declination, DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Visibility is a non-negotiable geographic constraint.** A star that never rises above the horizon cannot be detected, regardless of its brightness. The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. From this location, stars very close to the North Celestial Pole are never visible. The theoretical limit for visibility is that a star's declination must be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n*   **Calculation:** `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Any star with a declination significantly higher than +65.4° is not visible.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   a) **Canopus:** DEC ≈ -52.7°. This is well within the visible range. **(Visible)**\n    *   b) **Polaris:** DEC ≈ +89.3°. This is far north of the +65.4° limit. **(Not Visible)**\n    *   c, d, e, f) **Hypothetical Stars:** DEC = 0°.

The table under the \"Expected S/N\" section for a 1-hour exposure in \"1-UT mode\" (one telescope) is the correct reference. For the High Resolution (HR) mode, the table explicitly states that a star with **V = 16 mag** yields an **S/N of 10**. Therefore, the brightness criterion is that a star's apparent magnitude must be **V ≤ 16.0**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Apparent magnitude, not absolute magnitude, is what matters.** For the hypothetical stars, we must calculate their apparent magnitude (m) from their given absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    *   **c) Star at 10 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0`\n    *   **d) Star at 200 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`\n    *   **e) Star at 5 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`\n    *   **f) Star at 50 pc:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation and Count**\n\nWe now consolidate the results.
