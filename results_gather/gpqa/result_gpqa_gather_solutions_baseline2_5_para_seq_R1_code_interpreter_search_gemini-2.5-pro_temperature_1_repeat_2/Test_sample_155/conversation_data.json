This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond from opposite faces.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** All the candidate answers correctly apply the established stereochemical rule: the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene produces a single, achiral **meso compound**. This product (meso-octane-4,5-diol) has stereocenters but is achiral overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Reaction 1 yields **one** unique compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: Anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The candidates unanimously apply the corresponding rule: the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Reaction 2 yields **two** compounds, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains the products from both reactions. Therefore, there are **three** distinct stereoisomers in total:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The stereochemical relationships are critical for predicting the chromatographic outcome. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds.\n\n4.  **Predict the Chromatographic Behavior**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical properties and thus cannot be separated. Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n        *   **Outcome:** The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers.\n        *   **Outcome:** The chiral column will separate all three distinct stereoisomers. It will resolve the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) from each other, and it will also separate the meso-diol from the other two. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe scientific reasoning is unanimous and definitive: the final mixture will produce **2 peaks on a standard (achiral) HPLC column** and **3 peaks on a chiral HPLC column**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options presented in the question:\n\n*   A) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n*   B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n*   C) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n*   D) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct statement is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a careful review and synthesis of the candidate answers, the following step-by-step analysis determines the correct solution.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Unanimous Agreement on Chemical Principles**: All fifteen candidate answers, without exception, agree on the underlying stereochemistry of the reactions.

(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   The relationships between them are: the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**, and the meso isomer is a **diastereomer** to both of them.\n\n5.  **Prediction for Chromatographic Separation**:\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n        *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will separate.\n        *   Enantiomers (the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will *not* separate, eluting together as one peak.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC**: This technique uses a chiral stationary phase specifically designed to separate stereoisomers.\n        *   It can separate diastereomers and, crucially, it can also resolve enantiomers into separate peaks.\n        *   **Conclusion**: All three unique stereoisomers will be separated, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe unanimous and correct scientific conclusion is that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.\n\nNow, matching this result to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.

(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers. This distinction is crucial for chromatography.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties (e.g., polarity). In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical properties.\n        *   The enantiomers—(4R,5R) and (4S,5S)—will not be separated and will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, has different physical properties and will elute at a different time, producing a **separate peak**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment specifically designed to differentiate between stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n        *   The chiral column will separate all three stereoisomers.

An achiral column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n        *   **Outcome:** The two enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will elute at a different time as a separate peak.

A meso compound contains stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: Anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture**—a 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is formed: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The relationships between these isomers are critical for chromatography: the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) molecules are **enantiomers** of each other, while the meso molecule is a **diastereomer** of both.\n\n4.  **Predict the Chromatographic Outcomes**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute, appearing as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into distinct peaks. Therefore, the meso compound will elute at a different time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment specifically designed to resolve enantiomers.\n        *   A chiral column will resolve all three unique stereoisomers because it can interact differently with each of them. It will separate the meso compound (a diastereomer) and, crucially, will also separate the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) from each other.\n        *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe scientific reasoning is unambiguous: the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram**. Matching this result with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   B) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n*   C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n*   D) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the underlying chemical and chromatographic principles.
