Here is a step-by-step breakdown synthesizing the unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**:\n    *   **Observation**: A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158. The intensity ratio is 100:32, or approximately 3:1.\n    *   **Interpretation**: This specific 3:1 isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundances of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes. All options have the correct molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**:\n    *   **Observation**: An extremely broad peak spanning 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation**: This combination is the unmistakable fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

The presence of only **two doublets, each representing two protons**, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The substituents must be in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n        *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which is *ortho* substituted, would be unsymmetrical and produce four different signals for the aromatic protons. It is therefore incorrect.\n        *   A) **4-chlorobenzoic acid** has the exact para symmetry required to produce two sets of equivalent protons, perfectly matching the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe integration of all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single, unambiguous structure.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis: Identifying the Presence of Chlorine**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156 (100% intensity) and an isotope peak (M⁺+2) is at m/z = 158 (32% intensity).\n*   **Careful Point:** The relative intensity ratio of the M⁺ to the M⁺+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). All four options are consistent with this molecular weight and elemental composition.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis: Identifying the Functional Group**\n*   **Data:** A very broad absorption spanning 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Careful Point:** This combination of signals is the classic, unmistakable fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** This finding eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate is an acyl chloride/ester derivative and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is an aldehyde/phenol and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two benzoic acid isomers: C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis: Determining the Isomer**\n*   **Data:** Three signals are observed: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Acidic Proton):** The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the far downfield region (>10 ppm), which is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Molecular Symmetry):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the most decisive piece of evidence. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is the signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry creates only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would show four unique aromatic proton signals, resulting in a more complex spectrum. It is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para* (1,4) substituted. Its symmetry perfectly explains the observed NMR pattern.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy integrating all three spectroscopic techniques, the identity of the unknown compound is definitively established. The MS data proves the presence of one chlorine atom, the IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR data specifies the substitution pattern as *para* (1,4). The only structure that satisfies all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.

The reasoning presented by all the candidate agents is chemically sound and leads to the same structural conclusion, despite some variations in the final letter choice due to different option listings.\n\nHere is a comprehensive analysis of the spectral data, highlighting the critical points for identification.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) - Identifying Key Atoms and Molecular Weight**\n    *   **Data:** A molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 156 (100% intensity) and an isotope peak (M⁺+2) at m/z = 158 (32% intensity).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The most important feature is the intensity ratio of the M⁺ and M⁺+2 peaks, which is approximately 3:1 (100:32). This is a definitive isotopic signature indicating the presence of **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom, and its molecular weight using the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol. All four provided options (A, B, C, D) have a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂ and a nominal mass of 156, so this data confirms a key compositional detail but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy - Identifying the Primary Functional Group**\n    *   **Data:** A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a separate strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This combination of signals is the textbook fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad absorption (often called a \"hairy beard\") is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding found in carboxylic acid dimers. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This finding confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid, which allows us to eliminate options that lack this group.\n        *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (aldehyde/phenol) - **Eliminated.**\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (acyl chloride/ester derivative) - **Eliminated.**\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two benzoic acid isomers: **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) - Determining the Isomer**\n    *   **Data:** Three distinct signals: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic downfield region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR analysis.\n        *   The pattern in the aromatic region is the most critical piece of evidence for identifying the correct isomer. The presence of only **two doublets, with each one integrating to two protons (2H)**, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the aromatic ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side of the ring equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. This allows for a definitive choice between the two remaining options.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would show four distinct aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting. It is inconsistent with the data.\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *para* (1,4) substituted. Its structure possesses the exact symmetry required to produce the observed \"two doublets of 2H each\" pattern. It is a perfect match for the NMR data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe integration of all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single, unambiguous structure. The MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom, the IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR data establishes a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

The intensity ratio is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This 3:1 isotopic ratio is the definitive signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes. This confirms the presence of chlorine and a molecular weight of 156 (for the molecule with ³⁵Cl).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **Observation:** The spectrum has two distinctive features: a very broad peak spanning 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This combination is an unmistakable fingerprint for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

Careful Point 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS) - Determining Elemental Composition**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion (M⁺) peak is observed at m/z = 156 with 100% relative abundance, and an M⁺+2 peak is at m/z = 158 with 32% relative abundance.\n*   **Interpretation:** The ratio of the M⁺ to the M⁺+2 peak intensity is approximately 3:1 (100:32). This is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule that contains **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 (using the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope). This is consistent with all four options.\n\n**2. Careful Point 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy - Identifying the Key Functional Group**\n*   **Data:** A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:** This combination of signals is the unmistakable fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The exceptionally broad \"hairy beard\" peak is the characteristic O-H stretch, significantly broadened by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** This finding allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) is incorrect.\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester derivative) is incorrect.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Careful Point 3: ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) - Determining the Isomeric Structure**\n*   **Data:** Three signals are observed: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic downfield region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The aromatic region provides the most crucial evidence. The pattern of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* arrangement on the benzene ring. This allows for a definitive choice between the remaining options:\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* substituted. It is not symmetrical and would show four unique aromatic proton signals, resulting in a much more complex spectrum. It is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para* substituted. This structure has the exact symmetry required to produce the observed pattern of two sets of equivalent protons, which perfectly matches the \"two doublets of 2H\" NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points unequivocally to a single structure. The MS data proves the presence of one chlorine atom, the IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR data establishes a *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

This is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope). All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and match this data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy: Identifying the Functional Group**\n*   **Observation**: A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is present, along with a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation**: This combination of signals is the unmistakable fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the far downfield region, characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, which corroborates the IR data.\n    2.  The pattern in the aromatic region is the most discriminating piece of evidence. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The molecule's symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. This allows for a final, definitive choice:\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* substituted.

The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is the signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry creates only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* (1,2) substituted.

The extremely broad absorption (often called a \"hairy beard\") is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding found in carboxylic acid dimers. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This finding confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid, which allows us to eliminate options that lack this group.\n        *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (aldehyde/phenol) - **Eliminated.**\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (acyl chloride/ester derivative) - **Eliminated.**\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two benzoic acid isomers: **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) - Determining the Isomer**\n    *   **Data:** Three distinct signals: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic downfield region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR analysis.\n        *   The pattern in the aromatic region is the most critical piece of evidence for identifying the correct isomer.

Careful Point 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy - Identifying the Key Functional Group**\n*   **Data:** A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:** This combination of signals is the unmistakable fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The exceptionally broad \"hairy beard\" peak is the characteristic O-H stretch, significantly broadened by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** This finding allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) is incorrect.\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester derivative) is incorrect.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Careful Point 3: ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) - Determining the Isomeric Structure**\n*   **Data:** Three signals are observed: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic downfield region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The aromatic region provides the most crucial evidence. The pattern of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* arrangement on the benzene ring. This allows for a definitive choice between the remaining options:\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* substituted. It is not symmetrical and would show four unique aromatic proton signals, resulting in a much more complex spectrum.

The exceptionally broad \"hairy beard\" peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion**: This finding allows for the elimination of options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester derivative) -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy: Determining the Isomer**\n*   **Observation**: Three distinct signals are present: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation**:\n    1.  The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the far downfield region, characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, which corroborates the IR data.\n    2.  The pattern in the aromatic region is the most discriminating piece of evidence. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The molecule's symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent, leading to only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two substituents (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. This allows for a final, definitive choice:\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex spectrum. It is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para* substituted.
