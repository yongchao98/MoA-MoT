All candidate agents who provided detailed reasoning followed this same successful method.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe task is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using correct relativistic mechanics and the kinetic energy calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step upon which all other calculations rely.\n\n*   **Given:** The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Calculation of Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `E_final_rest = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** The problem states one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship applies directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We have a system of two equations to find the individual rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting the second equation into the first yields `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and consistently use energy units (GeV) throughout the initial steps.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy that is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This is the key principle that determines how kinetic energy is partitioned.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass for a fixed momentum.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The principle `|p₁| = |p₂| = p` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** We must use the correct relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is key. The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference requested by the question.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The answer options are in MeV. Using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential not to forget this final unit conversion.\n\nComparing the result of 5 MeV with the provided options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers from other agents, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical procedure, and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the lettered choices are due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent. The following is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that verifies the correct calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\nThe foundation of the problem is to correctly calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The fission results in two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given that one is twice as massive, so we define `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We now solve a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-Value).**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy is known as the Q-value.\n\n*   `Q = T_total = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. This is a critical piece of information for the next steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).**\n\nHere we use classical (non-relativistic) mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its momentum was zero. The two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is the key to solving for the energy distribution.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a constant momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2 (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) and substituting the relationship gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ (`T₁_correct`).**\n\nNow we repeat the calculation using the equations of special relativity.\n\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation. This requires careful algebra.\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key simplification occurs as the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the final difference and convert to the correct units.**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final step is to convert this result from GeV to MeV, as the options are in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the provided list of options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic review of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result. All discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with different orderings of the options.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic and highlights critical points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step upon which all other calculations rely.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass.\n    *   Mass ratio of fragments: `m₁ = 2m₂`, where `m₁` is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  First, calculate the total rest-mass energy of the final fragments:\n        `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    2.  Now, solve the system of two equations:\n        *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    3.  Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    4.  This yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then correctly assign the calculated energies to the respective fragments. `m₁` corresponds to 198 GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy difference between the initial and final rest states is released as kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. It must be partitioned between them in the subsequent steps.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2 (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) and substituting the ratio, we get: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which yields `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake would be to split the energy equally. In classical mechanics, the lighter fragment always receives a larger share of the kinetic energy.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nThe conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The relationship is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The algebra must be performed meticulously. A key simplification occurs when the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the value from the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final step is to convert the result to MeV as requested by the options. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**. Comparing this to the provided options in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows a strong and unanimous consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve the problem. Every detailed solution arrives at the same final numerical value. The variations in the final lettered choices are simply artifacts of different option ordering. The following is a definitive, consolidated analysis of the correct solution path, highlighting key points and potential pitfalls.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe initial state is a nucleus with rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`. It fissions into two fragments, a more massive one (`m₁`) and a less massive one (`m₂`).\n\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂`, which means their rest-mass energies are also in the ratio `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which yields `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is critical to correctly interpret \"99% of the initial mass\" as applying to the sum of rest-mass energies. All subsequent calculations rely on the accurate values of `198 GeV` and `99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value represents the *total* kinetic energy that must be partitioned between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of any single fragment.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is the key to solving for the energy partition.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We have the relation `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the relation gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which results in `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The lighter fragment receives more kinetic energy in a two-body decay, a key concept from classical mechanics. It is a common mistake to assume the energy is split equally or in direct proportion to mass.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is crucial. A key feature of this problem's setup is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation and convert to the appropriate units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we must convert the result using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This final unit conversion is a simple but critical step where an error can easily be made.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to the key physical principles and calculations at each stage. This process verifies the methodology used by the candidate agents.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe first task is to calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced in the fission.\n\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the final fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This translates to the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × E_initial = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given the mass ratio where one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first yields: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**Careful Point**: It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then correctly solve the system of equations for the individual fragments. T₁ corresponds to the more massive fragment (`m₁`).\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments according to the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: This Q-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments, so `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This shows that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`. The lighter fragment carries more kinetic energy.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: Remember this is only an approximation. A common mistake is to split the kinetic energy equally or in direct proportion to mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nConservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still applies, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The correct relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is kinetic energy and `mc²` is rest-mass energy.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding both sides gives:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now we solve the linear equation for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: This algebraic manipulation is the most error-prone step. Care must be taken with expanding the terms and collecting like terms.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: The final conversion to MeV is a required step to match the answer options.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result. The variations in the selected letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers are due to different orderings of the options presented to each agent. The core calculation is robust and verified by all agents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the solution, highlighting the crucial points in the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the two simultaneous equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which means `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Resulting Energies:**\n    *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) due to the conservation of momentum.\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, so `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`  \n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relation between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta `p` are equal, we can set the expressions for `(pc)²` equal for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Finally, we convert this value to MeV, as the options are in MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Initial Setup:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (`297 GeV`) and then solve the system of equations for the individual fragment energies (`198 GeV` and `99 GeV`).\n2.  **Conservation Laws:** Conservation of energy gives the *total* kinetic energy available (`3 GeV`). Conservation of momentum is the key to determining how this energy is *distributed* between the two fragments.\n3.  **Formula Selection:** Use the classical `T = p²/2m` for the approximation and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)` for the correct value. Do not mix them.\n4.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation in Step 4 is the most complex part. Care must be taken in expanding and simplifying the equation. The cancellation of the `T₁²` term is a helpful check.\n5.  **Unit Conversion:** The final calculation gives the answer in GeV. Forgetting to convert to MeV by multiplying by 1000 would lead to a wrong answer choice.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points highlighted to ensure a clear and accurate solution, based on the consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThe foundation of the problem is correctly calculating the rest-mass energies of the two fragments after fission.\n\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of this initial value:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which means their rest-mass energies are also in a 2:1 ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We can now solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then accurately solve the system of equations. All calculations should be kept in a consistent unit, like GeV, until the final step.\n\n---\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy \"lost\" from rest mass, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   By the law of conservation of energy: `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy that is shared between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of any single fragment.\n\n---\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nHere we use classical mechanics to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`).\n\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a fixed momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   We use this ratio (`T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`) with the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This is an approximation. A common mistake would be to assume the energy is split equally; instead, in the classical limit, the lighter particle gets more kinetic energy.\n\n---\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct `T₁` using the Relativistic Formula**\nNow we repeat the calculation using the correct formulas from special relativity.\n\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds true.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta `p` are equal, we can set the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out. This simplifies the problem from a potentially difficult quadratic equation to a simple linear one.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for the correct `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe final step is to find the difference requested by the question and convert the units.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The answer options are in MeV, so a final unit conversion is necessary. Using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct and classically approximated value for T1 is 5 MeV. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic review of the provided answers, there is a strong and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical steps, and the final numerical result. The slight variations in the lettered choice among the candidates stem from different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with. The following analysis consolidates their reasoning into a single, definitive step-by-step solution, highlighting crucial points of the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial energy:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) has twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solution:** We solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which yields `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`. This gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Correctly setting up this system of equations is the foundation for the entire problem. It's essential to correctly associate `m₁` and `T₁` with the more massive fragment (`198 GeV`).\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\n*   **Principle:** By the law of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   **Calculation:** `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Formula:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a fixed momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solution:** Substitute this ratio into the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`):\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` → `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    This gives `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to split the kinetic energy equally or directly in proportion to mass. The inverse relationship is a direct consequence of momentum conservation in the classical limit.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   **Formula:** The relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is kinetic energy.\n*   **Equation:** Since the momentum values `p` are equal, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solution:** Substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is key. A convenient feature of this problem is that the `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides, simplifying the calculation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\n\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, so a final conversion is necessary (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV × (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final answer is the *difference* between the two values, not either value itself. A failure to perform the final unit conversion is also a potential source of error.\n\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of all provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical procedure. Every solution that provides a detailed breakdown follows the same logical steps and arrives at the identical numerical result of 5 MeV.

This translates to the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive, so we define `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n    *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-Value).**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = T_total = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest (initial momentum = 0), the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is crucial and applies to both classical and relativistic calculations.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a constant momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the relationship: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ (`T₁_correct`).**\n\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values `p` are equal, we can set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key simplification occurs as the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation.

All agents who showed their work followed the same logical path and arrived at the same numerical result. The only variations were in the final letter choice, indicating they were given different option lists. The following is a definitive, step-by-step verification of the calculation with key careful points highlighted.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe initial state is a nucleus with `Mc² = 300 GeV`. After fission, it splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given two conditions to find their individual rest-mass energies (`E_rest = mc²`).\n\n*   **Sum of final rest-mass energies:** `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Ratio of masses:** The more massive fragment `m₁` is twice the mass of the other, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n\nWe solve this system of two equations:\n`2 * E_rest₂ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n\nThis yields:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `E_rest₁ = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify that T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`. Using consistent units (GeV) throughout the calculation is essential.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy between the initial and final states is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This 3 GeV is the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). This relationship is vital for the next steps.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   We can combine this ratio (`T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`) with the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`).\n    `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`\n*   Thus, the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This value is only an approximation. In the classical case, the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy as the heavier one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\nThe principle of momentum conservation (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic formula connecting kinetic energy, rest-mass energy, and momentum.\n\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation can be written as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values are equal, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now we substitute our known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, which conveniently simplifies the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation. Careful algebraic manipulation is key.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n*   `600T₁ = 603`\n*   The correct, relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the value from the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The final step is to convert this result from GeV to MeV, as the options are in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis final result of 5 MeV is robust and confirmed by the consensus of all candidate answers. Matching this to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 10 MeV\nB) 2 MeV\nC) 20 MeV\nD) 5 MeV\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical formulas, and step-by-step procedure required to solve this problem. Every agent who showed their work followed the same correct logical path and arrived at the identical numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are evidently due to the agents being presented with different orderings for the multiple-choice options.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown of the solution, incorporating all the crucial \"careful points\" that must be observed to avoid errors.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nFirst, we must calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the final rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of this initial value:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), which means their rest-mass energies are also in this ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\nSolving this gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the kinetic energy `T₁` corresponds to the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   By conservation of energy, `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means the less massive fragment gets twice the kinetic energy.\n*   We solve for `T₁,classical` by combining the ratio (`T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`) with the total kinetic energy (`T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`):\n    `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV` which gives `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This value is an approximation. A common mistake is to assume the energy is split equally or in direct proportion to mass. In classical mechanics, the lighter object always receives more kinetic energy.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁)**\nThe principle of momentum conservation still applies (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point:** A key feature of this problem setup is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation. Performing the subsequent algebra carefully is critical.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n*   `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert the units.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for the answer in MeV, so this final unit conversion is a mandatory step.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the provided list of options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the correct and consistent reasoning found across all the candidate answers, with special attention to careful points in the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the kinetic energy of one of the fragments using two different models (classical and relativistic) and then find the difference. An analysis of all the provided answers shows a strong consensus on the methodology and the final numerical result. The only variation lies in the final letter choice, which is due to different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive, step-by-step verification of the calculation.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis is the foundational step. All subsequent calculations depend on these values.\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is given as `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We have two equations to solve:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting the second equation into the first yields: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Results:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then accurately solve the system of equations. Keeping calculations in GeV is the most convenient approach.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   **Result:** `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This total of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). This relationship is crucial for the subsequent steps.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its total momentum was zero. The fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is the key to solving for the energy distribution.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We have the relation `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. We substitute this into the total energy equation from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Note that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) receives less kinetic energy, as expected from classical mechanics.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct `T₁` using the Relativistic Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since the momentum values `p` are equal, their squared values (`(pc)²`) are also equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute all the known values (energies in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The algebra must be performed precisely. A key feature of this problem setup is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and the classical values and convert the units.\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`.\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, so we must convert our result using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A mistake in this final, simple conversion is a potential source of error.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classically-approximated value for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **5 MeV**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the consistent reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated relativistically (correct value) and classically (approximation). An analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the method and the numerical result.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis is the foundational calculation upon which everything else depends.\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c² + m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial value.\n    `E_final_rest = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which yields `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   It's important to remember that this 3 GeV is the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from the previous step: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy T₁**\nMomentum conservation (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic formula.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   This is the most complex algebraic step. We must substitute the known values carefully: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation. This is a common feature in problems of this type.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the Final Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final step is to convert the answer to MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result of the problem. All detailed solutions follow an identical, correct logical path. The slight variation in the final letter choices among the candidates indicates they were likely presented with differently ordered options.\n\nThe task is to perform a definitive, step-by-step verification of this robust calculation and identify the correct option from the list provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nFirst, we must calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also holds for their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the following system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This yields:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly associate the calculated energies. `T₁` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy converted from rest mass into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved.\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nHere we calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment, `T₁`, using classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We have the relation `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`. We also know that `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting gives:\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Relativistic Formula**\nNext, we repeat the calculation using the correct equations from special relativity.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since the momentum values are equal, we can set the `(pc)²` terms for each fragment equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out. This simplification is a key feature of this problem and a good check that the algebra is on the right track.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and the classically-approximated values and convert the result to MeV.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This final conversion from GeV to MeV is crucial and must be performed correctly.\n\nThe calculated difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is 5 MeV.

The solution involves applying conservation of energy and momentum in both frameworks.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe first step is to establish the initial conditions and then calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced in the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nWe now solve the system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n`2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n\nThis yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It's essential to correctly identify `m₁` as the more massive fragment and associate its rest-mass energy of 198 GeV with the kinetic energy `T₁` that we need to calculate.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe energy \"lost\" from the system's rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This 3 GeV is the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. This allows us to write the crucial relationship `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is fundamental to both the classical and relativistic calculations.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy Formula:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n    This gives `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic `T₁` (`T₁_correct`)**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum** still holds: `|p₁| = |p₂|`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The correct formula connecting kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, so are the squares of their momenta: `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The algebra must be performed precisely. Note that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, which simplifies the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classically-approximated values and convert the result to the required units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this numerical result with the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "An analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical procedure to solve the problem. All detailed solutions follow the same logical steps and arrive at the identical numerical result of 5 MeV. The minor variations in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are simply due to the fact that the options were presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic from the provided answers and highlights critical points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step upon which all other calculations rely.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is given as `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial energy:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nWe now solve this system of two linear equations:\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first yields:\n`2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n\nThis gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly associate the calculated energies. `T₁` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments according to the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This Q-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). It is not the kinetic energy of any single fragment.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is an approximation. Note that the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy as the heavier one, a key consequence of momentum conservation in the classical limit.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy T₁**\nMomentum conservation (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still applies, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is kinetic energy.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now we substitute our known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The algebraic manipulation must be performed meticulously. A key feature of this problem is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the calculation from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final step is to convert the result from GeV to MeV to match the units in the options. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `E_final_rest = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** The problem states one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship applies directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We have a system of two equations to find the individual rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting the second equation into the first yields `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and consistently use energy units (GeV) throughout the initial steps.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy that is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This is the key principle that determines how kinetic energy is partitioned.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass for a fixed momentum.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.

The discrepancies in the lettered choices are due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent. The following is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that verifies the correct calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\nThe foundation of the problem is to correctly calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The fission results in two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given that one is twice as massive, so we define `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We now solve a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-Value).**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy is known as the Q-value.\n\n*   `Q = T_total = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. This is a critical piece of information for the next steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).**\n\nHere we use classical (non-relativistic) mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its momentum was zero. The two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is the key to solving for the energy distribution.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a constant momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2 (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) and substituting the relationship gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ (`T₁_correct`).**\n\nNow we repeat the calculation using the equations of special relativity.\n\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation. This requires careful algebra.\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key simplification occurs as the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the final difference and convert to the correct units.**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final step is to convert this result from GeV to MeV, as the options are in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the provided list of options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic review of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result. All discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with different orderings of the options.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic and highlights critical points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step upon which all other calculations rely.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass.\n    *   Mass ratio of fragments: `m₁ = 2m₂`, where `m₁` is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  First, calculate the total rest-mass energy of the final fragments:\n        `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    2.  Now, solve the system of two equations:\n        *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    3.  Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    4.  This yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then correctly assign the calculated energies to the respective fragments. `m₁` corresponds to 198 GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy difference between the initial and final rest states is released as kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. It must be partitioned between them in the subsequent steps.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2 (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) and substituting the ratio, we get: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which yields `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake would be to split the energy equally. In classical mechanics, the lighter fragment always receives a larger share of the kinetic energy.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nThe conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The relationship is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The algebra must be performed meticulously. A key simplification occurs when the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the value from the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final step is to convert the result to MeV as requested by the options. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**. Comparing this to the provided options in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows a strong and unanimous consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve the problem. Every detailed solution arrives at the same final numerical value. The variations in the final lettered choices are simply artifacts of different option ordering. The following is a definitive, consolidated analysis of the correct solution path, highlighting key points and potential pitfalls.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe initial state is a nucleus with rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`. It fissions into two fragments, a more massive one (`m₁`) and a less massive one (`m₂`).\n\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂`, which means their rest-mass energies are also in the ratio `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which yields `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is critical to correctly interpret \"99% of the initial mass\" as applying to the sum of rest-mass energies. All subsequent calculations rely on the accurate values of `198 GeV` and `99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value represents the *total* kinetic energy that must be partitioned between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of any single fragment.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is the key to solving for the energy partition.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We have the relation `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the relation gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which results in `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The lighter fragment receives more kinetic energy in a two-body decay, a key concept from classical mechanics. It is a common mistake to assume the energy is split equally or in direct proportion to mass.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is crucial. A key feature of this problem's setup is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation and convert to the appropriate units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we must convert the result using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This final unit conversion is a simple but critical step where an error can easily be made.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to the key physical principles and calculations at each stage. This process verifies the methodology used by the candidate agents.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe first task is to calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced in the fission.\n\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the final fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This translates to the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × E_initial = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given the mass ratio where one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first yields: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**Careful Point**: It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then correctly solve the system of equations for the individual fragments. T₁ corresponds to the more massive fragment (`m₁`).\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments according to the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: This Q-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments, so `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This shows that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`. The lighter fragment carries more kinetic energy.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: Remember this is only an approximation. A common mistake is to split the kinetic energy equally or in direct proportion to mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nConservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still applies, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The correct relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is kinetic energy and `mc²` is rest-mass energy.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding both sides gives:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now we solve the linear equation for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: This algebraic manipulation is the most error-prone step. Care must be taken with expanding the terms and collecting like terms.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Careful Point**: The final conversion to MeV is a required step to match the answer options.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result.

The core calculation is robust and verified by all agents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the solution, highlighting the crucial points in the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the two simultaneous equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which means `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Resulting Energies:**\n    *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) due to the conservation of momentum.\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, so `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`  \n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relation between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta `p` are equal, we can set the expressions for `(pc)²` equal for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Finally, we convert this value to MeV, as the options are in MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Initial Setup:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (`297 GeV`) and then solve the system of equations for the individual fragment energies (`198 GeV` and `99 GeV`).\n2.  **Conservation Laws:** Conservation of energy gives the *total* kinetic energy available (`3 GeV`). Conservation of momentum is the key to determining how this energy is *distributed* between the two fragments.\n3.  **Formula Selection:** Use the classical `T = p²/2m` for the approximation and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)` for the correct value. Do not mix them.\n4.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation in Step 4 is the most complex part. Care must be taken in expanding and simplifying the equation. The cancellation of the `T₁²` term is a helpful check.\n5.  **Unit Conversion:** The final calculation gives the answer in GeV. Forgetting to convert to MeV by multiplying by 1000 would lead to a wrong answer choice.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points highlighted to ensure a clear and accurate solution, based on the consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThe foundation of the problem is correctly calculating the rest-mass energies of the two fragments after fission.\n\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of this initial value:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which means their rest-mass energies are also in a 2:1 ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We can now solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then accurately solve the system of equations. All calculations should be kept in a consistent unit, like GeV, until the final step.\n\n---\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy \"lost\" from rest mass, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   By the law of conservation of energy: `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy that is shared between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of any single fragment.\n\n---\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nHere we use classical mechanics to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`).\n\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a fixed momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   We use this ratio (`T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`) with the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This is an approximation. A common mistake would be to assume the energy is split equally; instead, in the classical limit, the lighter particle gets more kinetic energy.\n\n---\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct `T₁` using the Relativistic Formula**\nNow we repeat the calculation using the correct formulas from special relativity.\n\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds true.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta `p` are equal, we can set the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out. This simplifies the problem from a potentially difficult quadratic equation to a simple linear one.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for the correct `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe final step is to find the difference requested by the question and convert the units.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The answer options are in MeV, so a final unit conversion is necessary. Using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct and classically approximated value for T1 is 5 MeV.

Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\n*   **Principle:** By the law of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   **Calculation:** `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Formula:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a fixed momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solution:** Substitute this ratio into the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`):\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` → `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    This gives `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to split the kinetic energy equally or directly in proportion to mass. The inverse relationship is a direct consequence of momentum conservation in the classical limit.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   **Formula:** The relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is kinetic energy.\n*   **Equation:** Since the momentum values `p` are equal, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solution:** Substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is key. A convenient feature of this problem is that the `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides, simplifying the calculation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\n\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, so a final conversion is necessary (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV × (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final answer is the *difference* between the two values, not either value itself. A failure to perform the final unit conversion is also a potential source of error.\n\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of all provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical procedure.

This translates to the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive, so we define `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n    *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-Value).**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = T_total = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest (initial momentum = 0), the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is crucial and applies to both classical and relativistic calculations.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a constant momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the relationship: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ (`T₁_correct`).**\n\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values `p` are equal, we can set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key simplification occurs as the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation.

All agents who showed their work followed the same logical path and arrived at the same numerical result. The only variations were in the final letter choice, indicating they were given different option lists. The following is a definitive, step-by-step verification of the calculation with key careful points highlighted.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe initial state is a nucleus with `Mc² = 300 GeV`. After fission, it splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given two conditions to find their individual rest-mass energies (`E_rest = mc²`).\n\n*   **Sum of final rest-mass energies:** `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Ratio of masses:** The more massive fragment `m₁` is twice the mass of the other, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n\nWe solve this system of two equations:\n`2 * E_rest₂ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n\nThis yields:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `E_rest₁ = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify that T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`. Using consistent units (GeV) throughout the calculation is essential.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy between the initial and final states is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This 3 GeV is the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). This relationship is vital for the next steps.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   We can combine this ratio (`T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`) with the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`).\n    `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`\n*   Thus, the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This value is only an approximation. In the classical case, the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy as the heavier one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\nThe principle of momentum conservation (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic formula connecting kinetic energy, rest-mass energy, and momentum.\n\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation can be written as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values are equal, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now we substitute our known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, which conveniently simplifies the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation. Careful algebraic manipulation is key.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n*   `600T₁ = 603`\n*   The correct, relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the value from the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The final step is to convert this result from GeV to MeV, as the options are in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis final result of 5 MeV is robust and confirmed by the consensus of all candidate answers. Matching this to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 10 MeV\nB) 2 MeV\nC) 20 MeV\nD) 5 MeV\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical formulas, and step-by-step procedure required to solve this problem. Every agent who showed their work followed the same correct logical path and arrived at the identical numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are evidently due to the agents being presented with different orderings for the multiple-choice options.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown of the solution, incorporating all the crucial \"careful points\" that must be observed to avoid errors.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nFirst, we must calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the final rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of this initial value:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), which means their rest-mass energies are also in this ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\nSolving this gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the kinetic energy `T₁` corresponds to the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   By conservation of energy, `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means the less massive fragment gets twice the kinetic energy.\n*   We solve for `T₁,classical` by combining the ratio (`T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`) with the total kinetic energy (`T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`):\n    `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV` which gives `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This value is an approximation. A common mistake is to assume the energy is split equally or in direct proportion to mass. In classical mechanics, the lighter object always receives more kinetic energy.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁)**\nThe principle of momentum conservation still applies (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point:** A key feature of this problem setup is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation. Performing the subsequent algebra carefully is critical.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n*   `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert the units.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for the answer in MeV, so this final unit conversion is a mandatory step.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the provided list of options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the correct and consistent reasoning found across all the candidate answers, with special attention to careful points in the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the kinetic energy of one of the fragments using two different models (classical and relativistic) and then find the difference. An analysis of all the provided answers shows a strong consensus on the methodology and the final numerical result. The only variation lies in the final letter choice, which is due to different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive, step-by-step verification of the calculation.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis is the foundational step. All subsequent calculations depend on these values.\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is given as `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We have two equations to solve:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting the second equation into the first yields: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Results:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then accurately solve the system of equations. Keeping calculations in GeV is the most convenient approach.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   **Result:** `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This total of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). This relationship is crucial for the subsequent steps.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its total momentum was zero. The fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is the key to solving for the energy distribution.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We have the relation `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. We substitute this into the total energy equation from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Note that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) receives less kinetic energy, as expected from classical mechanics.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct `T₁` using the Relativistic Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since the momentum values `p` are equal, their squared values (`(pc)²`) are also equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute all the known values (energies in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The algebra must be performed precisely. A key feature of this problem setup is that the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and the classical values and convert the units.\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`.\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, so we must convert our result using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A mistake in this final, simple conversion is a potential source of error.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classically-approximated value for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **5 MeV**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the consistent reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated relativistically (correct value) and classically (approximation). An analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the method and the numerical result.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis is the foundational calculation upon which everything else depends.\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c² + m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial value.\n    `E_final_rest = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which yields `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   It's important to remember that this 3 GeV is the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from the previous step: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy T₁**\nMomentum conservation (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic formula.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   This is the most complex algebraic step. We must substitute the known values carefully: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation. This is a common feature in problems of this type.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the Final Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final step is to convert the answer to MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result of the problem. All detailed solutions follow an identical, correct logical path. The slight variation in the final letter choices among the candidates indicates they were likely presented with differently ordered options.\n\nThe task is to perform a definitive, step-by-step verification of this robust calculation and identify the correct option from the list provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nFirst, we must calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also holds for their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve the following system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This yields:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly associate the calculated energies. `T₁` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy converted from rest mass into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved.\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nHere we calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment, `T₁`, using classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We have the relation `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`. We also know that `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting gives:\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Relativistic Formula**\nNext, we repeat the calculation using the correct equations from special relativity.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since the momentum values are equal, we can set the `(pc)²` terms for each fragment equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out. This simplification is a key feature of this problem and a good check that the algebra is on the right track.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and the classically-approximated values and convert the result to MeV.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are given in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This final conversion from GeV to MeV is crucial and must be performed correctly.\n\nThe calculated difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is 5 MeV. Comparing this with the provided options:\n\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the consistent reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial calculation points.\n\n### **Analysis and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nThe problem requires finding the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) as calculated using correct relativistic mechanics versus its value from a classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The solution involves applying conservation of energy and momentum in both frameworks.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe first step is to establish the initial conditions and then calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced in the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nWe now solve the system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n`2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n\nThis yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It's essential to correctly identify `m₁` as the more massive fragment and associate its rest-mass energy of 198 GeV with the kinetic energy `T₁` that we need to calculate.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe energy \"lost\" from the system's rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This 3 GeV is the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. This allows us to write the crucial relationship `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is fundamental to both the classical and relativistic calculations.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy Formula:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n    This gives `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic `T₁` (`T₁_correct`)**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum** still holds: `|p₁| = |p₂|`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The correct formula connecting kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, so are the squares of their momenta: `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The algebra must be performed precisely.
