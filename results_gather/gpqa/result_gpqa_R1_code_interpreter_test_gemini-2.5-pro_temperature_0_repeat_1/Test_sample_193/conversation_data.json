    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Spins:** We have three spins, S1, S2, and S3.\n*   **States:** Each spin can be either +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   **Total Microstates:** The total number of possible configurations (microstates) is 2 (for S1) × 2 (for S2) × 2 (for S3) = 8.\n*   **Energy Equation:** The energy of a given state is E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3].\n*   **Partition Function:** The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\n\n### 2. Enumerating States and Calculating Energies\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy for each, and then group them by their energy levels.\n\nLet's list the configurations (S1, S2, S3) and compute the corresponding energy E.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | (+1) + (+1) + (+1) = 3 | -3J |\n| 2 | +1 | +1 | -1 | (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1 | +J |\n| 3 | +1 | -1 | +1 | (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1 | +J |\n| 4 | +1 | -1 | -1 | (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1 | +J |\n| 5 | -1 | +1 | +1 | (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1 | +J |\n| 6 | -1 | +1 | -1 | (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1 | +J |\n| 7 | -1 | -1 | +1 | (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1 | +J |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | -1 | (+1) + (+1) + (+1) = 3 | -3J |\n\n### 3. Grouping by Energy Levels (Degeneracy)\n\nNow, we group the states that have the same energy. The number of states at a given energy level is called its degeneracy (g).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    *   This energy occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = +J:**\n    *   This energy occurs for the remaining 6 states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Partition Function\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by their degeneracies.\n\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n\n*   g1 = 2, E1 = -3J\n*   g2 = 6, E2 = +J\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
