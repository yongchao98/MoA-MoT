    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Components**\nFirst, we identify the chemical species we are mixing:\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid, which completely dissociates into H+ and Cl-.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base, which completely dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Moles of Acids and Bases**\nWe need to find the number of moles of acidic protons (H+) and basic hydroxide ions (OH-) before any reaction occurs.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.05 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.08 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since each Ba(OH)2 molecule provides two OH- ions, we multiply by 2.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 × 2 = **0.18 mol OH-**\n\n**3. Perform the Neutralization Reactions**\nThe strong base (OH-) will react with the acids. It will neutralize the strongest acid (H+ from HCl) first, and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H+ (from HCl) + OH- → H2O\n    *   We have 0.08 mol of H+ and 0.18 mol of OH-.\n    *   The H+ is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol OH-**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   We have 0.05 mol of CH3COOH and 0.10 mol of OH- remaining.\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol OH-**\n\n**4. Determine the Final State of the Solution**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of strong base (OH-). The presence of a strong base will dominate the pH of the solution.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH- = 0.05 mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Concentration and pH**\nTo find the pH, we first need the final concentration of the excess OH- ions.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a python script for the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1\nmoles_h_strong = 0.400 * 0.2\nmoles_oh_strong = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2\n\n# Neutralization reactions\nmoles_oh_after_rxn1 = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\nmoles_oh_after_rxn2 = moles_oh_after_rxn1 - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Final calculations\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_conc_oh = moles_oh_after_rxn2 / total_volume_L\npOH = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The final pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their nature:**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid. It dissociates completely into H⁺ and Cl⁻.\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base. It dissociates completely into Ba²⁺ and 2 OH⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species:**\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.05 mol CH₃COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.08 mol H⁺**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since each Ba(OH)₂ provides two OH⁻ ions: Moles of OH⁻ = 0.09 mol × 2 = **0.18 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids. It will neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, followed by the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid:** 0.08 mol (strong) + 0.05 mol (weak) = 0.13 mol\n*   **Total moles of base:** 0.18 mol (strong)\n\nSince the moles of the strong base (0.18 mol) are greater than the total moles of all acids (0.13 mol), the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Reaction with strong acid (HCl):**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   The 0.08 mol of H⁺ from HCl will react with 0.08 mol of OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol OH⁻**\n\n*   **Step 3b: Reaction with weak acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   The 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH will react with 0.05 mol of the remaining OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol OH⁻**\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\nAfter all reactions, there is an excess of 0.05 moles of OH⁻ in the solution. The pH will be determined by this excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = (Moles of excess OH⁻) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # Moles of weak acid\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2 # Moles of H+ from strong acid\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2 # Moles of OH- from strong base\n\n# Step 3: Perform neutralization\n# Strong base reacts with strong acid first\nmoles_oh_remaining_1 = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\n# Remaining strong base reacts with weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_remaining_1 - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 4: Calculate final concentration and pH\n# Calculate total volume\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300 # in Liters\n\n# Calculate final concentration of excess OH-\nfinal_oh_concentration = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The final pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
