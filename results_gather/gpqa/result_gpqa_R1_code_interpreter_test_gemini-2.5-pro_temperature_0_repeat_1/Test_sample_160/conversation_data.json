    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\nHowever, this formula is for a particle moving through stationary targets. When the target particles are also moving, a correction factor is needed.\n\n### 2. Analyze λ₁ (Mean Free Path of Gas-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   **Particles:** Gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **Target Density:** The number density of gas molecules, `n`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`.\n*   **Relative Motion:** Since the target gas molecules are also moving randomly (thermal motion), the collision frequency is higher than with stationary targets. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this introduces a factor of `√2` into the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the formula for λ₁ is:\nλ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n\n### 3. Analyze λ₂ (Mean Free Path of Electron-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   **Particles:** High-energy electrons from the microscope beam.\n*   **Target Density:** The same number density of gas molecules, `n`, as the gas conditions have not changed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule, let's call it `σ_e-gas`.\n*   **Relative Motion:** The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV. Their velocity is relativistic and extremely close to the speed of light. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules (typically a few hundred m/s) is completely negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. No `√2` correction factor is needed.\n\nTherefore, the formula for λ₂ is:\nλ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n\n### 4. Compare λ₁ and λ₂\n\nTo compare λ₂ and λ₁, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_e-gas)\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)\n\n### 5. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_e-gas)\n\nNow we need to evaluate the ratio of the cross-sections, `σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas`.\n\n*   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the effective \"size\" of the gas molecules. It represents the area within which two molecules must approach to interact significantly (a \"collision\").\n*   **`σ_e-gas`**: This is the scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron with a gas molecule. A high-energy electron is a very penetrating particle. It interacts with the atom's electromagnetic field, but because of its high speed, the interaction time is very short, and the probability of a significant deflection (a \"collision\") is low. The atom is relatively \"transparent\" to such a fast electron. Therefore, the electron scattering cross-section `σ_e-gas` is expected to be smaller than the kinetic cross-section `σ_gas-gas`.\n\nLet's consider a few scenarios for the cross-section ratio:\n\n*   **Scenario 1 (Simplest Case):** Assume, for simplicity, that the cross-sections are roughly equal: `σ_e-gas ≈ σ_gas-gas`.\n    In this case, the ratio `σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas ≈ 1`.\n    Then, λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ √2 ≈ 1.414.\n\n*   **Scenario 2 (Hard-Sphere Model):** This is a common textbook model. A gas molecule is a sphere of radius R, and an electron is a point particle.\n    *   `σ_gas-gas` = π(R+R)² = 4πR²\n    *   `σ_e-gas` = π(R+0)² = πR²\n    In this model, `σ_gas-gas = 4 * σ_e-gas`, so the ratio `σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas = 4`.\n    Then, λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * 4 ≈ 5.66.\n\n*   **Scenario 3 (Realistic High-Energy Physics):** As argued above, for 1000 keV electrons, `σ_e-gas` is significantly smaller than `σ_gas-gas`. This means the ratio `σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas > 1`.\n    Then, λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a number > 1), which means λ₂ / λ₁ > √2 ≈ 1.414.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nIn all plausible physical models, the ratio λ₂ / λ₁ is greater than or equal to √2.\n√2 ≈ 1.414.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\nA) λ₂ < λ₁\nB) λ₂ = λ₁\nC) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁\nD) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁\n\nSince our analysis consistently shows that λ₂ / λ₁ ≥ 1.414, and 1.414 is greater than 1.22, the only possible conclusion is D. The mean free path of the electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ₁).\n\nThe value 1.22 in the options serves as a threshold. The core physical principle (the `√2` factor) is enough to show that λ₂ is at least 1.414 times λ₁, which safely satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the mean free paths is given by:\n# lambda_2 / lambda_1 = sqrt(2) * (sigma_gas_gas / sigma_e_gas)\n\n# Let's analyze the lower bound of this ratio.\n# The most conservative assumption is that the cross-sections are equal,\n# or that the electron-gas cross-section is not smaller than the gas-gas cross-section.\n# In the simplest case, we can assume sigma_gas_gas / sigma_e_gas >= 1.\n# The absolute minimum for the ratio lambda_2 / lambda_1 is therefore sqrt(2),\n# which occurs when sigma_e_gas = sigma_gas_gas.\n\nmin_ratio = math.sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"The minimum theoretical ratio for λ2 / λ1 is sqrt(2), which is approximately {min_ratio:.3f}\")\n\n# Now we compare this minimum ratio to the threshold given in the options (1.22).\nthreshold = 1.22\nis_greater = min_ratio >= threshold\nprint(f\"Is {min_ratio:.3f} >= {threshold}? {is_greater}\")\n\n# Let's also calculate the ratio based on the hard-sphere model, where sigma_gas_gas / sigma_e_gas = 4.\nhard_sphere_ratio = math.sqrt(2) * 4\nprint(f\"The ratio λ2 / λ1 based on the hard-sphere model is 4*sqrt(2), which is approximately {hard_sphere_ratio:.3f}\")\nis_greater_hard_sphere = hard_sphere_ratio >= threshold\nprint(f\"Is {hard_sphere_ratio:.3f} >= {threshold}? {is_greater_hard_sphere}\")\n\n```\nThe minimum theoretical ratio for λ2 / λ1 is sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414\nIs 1.414 >= 1.22? True\nThe ratio λ2 / λ1 based on the hard-sphere model is 4*sqrt(2), which is approximately 5.657\nIs 5.657 >= 1.22? True\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Define the Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula is given by:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision to occur.\n\n### 2. Analyze λ₁: The Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules\n\n*   **Scenario:** This describes the collision of gas molecules with other gas molecules.\n*   **Particles:** The projectiles are gas molecules, and the targets are also gas molecules.\n*   **Key Consideration:** In this case, both the projectile and the target particles are in random thermal motion. The kinetic theory of gases shows that when accounting for the relative motion of all particles, the collision frequency increases, which reduces the mean free path. This introduces a correction factor of `√2` into the denominator.\n*   **Formula for λ₁:**\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where `n` is the number density of gas molecules and `σ_gg` is the gas-gas collision cross-section.\n\n### 3. Analyze λ₂: The Mean Free Path of Electrons\n\n*   **Scenario:** This describes the scattering of high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam with the residual gas molecules.\n*   **Particles:** The projectiles are electrons, and the targets are gas molecules.\n*   **Key Consideration:** The electrons are accelerated by a voltage of 1000 kV, giving them extremely high, relativistic velocities (very close to the speed of light). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules (typically a few hundred meters per second) is completely negligible in comparison. Therefore, from the perspective of the high-speed electron, the gas molecules are essentially stationary targets. The `√2` correction factor does not apply here.\n*   **Formula for λ₂:**\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where `n` is the same number density of gas molecules and `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n### 4. Compare λ₁ and λ₂\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n### 5. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)\n\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the physical size of the molecules. It represents the area two molecules must enter to \"collide.\"\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron. Such an electron is a point-like particle and is highly penetrating. It interacts with the atom's electromagnetic field, but because of its immense speed, the interaction is fleeting, and the probability of a significant scattering event (a \"collision\") is low. The atom is relatively \"transparent\" to such a fast electron. Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) is expected to be considerably smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n\nThis means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\n\nLet's evaluate the ratio λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg).\n\n*   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   We know (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio λ₂ / λ₁ must be greater than √2.\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ > √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) λ₂ < λ₁  (Incorrect)\nB) λ₂ = λ₁ (Incorrect)\nC) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁  (Incorrect, because λ₂/λ₁ > 1.414, so it cannot be less than 1.22)\nD) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁ (Correct. Since λ₂/λ₁ is greater than 1.414, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22)\n\nThe mean free path of the electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ₁) primarily due to two factors: 1) the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets for the fast electrons, and 2) the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two gas molecules. The first factor alone guarantees that λ₂ > √2 * λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>"
