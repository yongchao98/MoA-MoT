    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. \"Identical\" means they are indistinguishable. \"Spin-1/2\" means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n2.  **Define the Potential and Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. For a single particle in such a well, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2mL^2))$\n    where n is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    The problem defines a base energy unit $E = pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2mL^2)$.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 * E$\n\n3.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `ms` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n    This means that for each energy level `n`, there are two available spin states. Therefore, each energy level $E_n$ can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs):**\n    To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1 ($E_1 = 1^2 E = E$). We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2 ($E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$). We place the remaining two particles in this level.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        $E_{gs} = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1^2 E) + (1 * 2^2 E) + (1 * 3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state, or other possible configurations.\n    Let's list the low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n    *   **Ground State Config:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = $2(1^2) + 2(2^2) = 10E$.\n    *   **First Excited State Config:** {2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Energy = $2(1^2) + 1(2^2) + 1(3^2) = 15E$.\n    *   **Other possible excited configurations:**\n        *   **Config A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (leaving n=2 full). {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            Energy = $1(1^2) + 2(2^2) + 1(3^2) = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E$.\n        *   **Config B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n            Energy = $2(1^2) + 2(3^2) = 2 + 18 = 20E$.\n        *   **Config C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. {2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n            Energy = $2(1^2) + 1(2^2) + 1(4^2) = 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    Therefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be certain, we can use a Python script to systematically find the lowest energy configurations.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies for a system of 4 spin-1/2 particles\n    in a 1D infinite potential well.
