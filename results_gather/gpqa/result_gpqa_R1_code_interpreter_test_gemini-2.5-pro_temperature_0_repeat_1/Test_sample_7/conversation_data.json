    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the functional relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) based on the resistance phenotypes of single and double knock-out mutants. The key concepts to apply are epistasis and gene interaction.\n\n2.  **List the Data:** It's helpful to have a clear list of the resistance levels for each genotype.\n    *   Wild-type (WT): 100% (Control)\n    *   g1 (G1 knock-out): 75%\n    *   g2 (G2 knock-out): 0%\n    *   g3 (G3 knock-out): 50%\n    *   g1g2 (double knock-out): 0%\n    *   g2g3 (double knock-out): 0%\n    *   g1g3 (double knock-out): 10%\n\n3.  **Analyze the Single Mutants:**\n    *   `g1` has 75% resistance, meaning G1 contributes to resistance, but is not essential. Its loss causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n    *   `g2` has 0% resistance, meaning G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss causes a 100% drop in resistance.\n    *   `g3` has 50% resistance, meaning G3 contributes significantly to resistance. Its loss causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis:**\n    *   **Epistasis** occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants. The gene whose single-mutant phenotype is observed in the double mutant is said to be \"epistatic\" to the other gene.\n\n    *   **g1g2 vs. g1 and g2:**\n        *   Phenotype of `g1g2` is 0% resistance.\n        *   Phenotype of `g2` is 0% resistance.\n        *   Since the phenotype of `g1g2` is the same as `g2`, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n\n    *   **g2g3 vs. g2 and g3:**\n        *   Phenotype of `g2g3` is 0% resistance.\n        *   Phenotype of `g2` is 0% resistance.\n        *   Since the phenotype of `g2g3` is the same as `g2`, the `g2` mutation masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n    *   **g1g3 vs. g1 and g3:**\n        *   Phenotype of `g1g3` is 10% resistance.\n        *   Phenotype of `g1` is 75% resistance.\n        *   Phenotype of `g3` is 50% resistance.\n        *   The phenotype of the double mutant (10%) is different from both single mutants. Therefore, there is **no epistasis** between G1 and G3. Their interaction is synergistic, as the combined loss of function (90% loss of resistance) is greater than the sum of individual losses (25% + 50% = 75% loss).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Epistasis Analysis:**\n    The most definitive conclusions from the data are about epistasis. Let's check which option aligns with our findings.\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   \"...G2 is epistatic towards G1\": This statement is **TRUE**.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   \"...G3 is epistatic towards G1\": This statement is **FALSE**.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   \"...G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This statement is **FALSE**.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   \"...G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This statement is **FALSE**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Options B, C, and D all contain a statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 that is demonstrably false based on the experimental data. Option A is the only one that contains a correct statement about epistasis (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"). While the other claims in option A (\"G1 is a transcription factor\" and \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\") cannot be definitively proven or disproven with the given data, they are not contradicted by it either. A plausible scenario exists where G1 is a transcription factor and G2 is an essential downstream protein, which would result in G2 being epistatic to G1. Since option A is the only one without a factually incorrect statement, it is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
