    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin state can be described by a 2-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with\" the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B_z` and `E_down = +γ(ħ/2)B_z`.\n*   The lowest energy state (assuming `γ > 0`) is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   So, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]^T`, this is our initial state vector.\n\n### 2. Understand the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field `B` of the same magnitude is turned on along the +Y direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_y B`.\n*   The time evolution of the state `|ψ(t)>` is governed by this new Hamiltonian according to the Schrödinger equation.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by:\n`|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`:\n`|ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\nTo calculate this, it's easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian, which is the eigenbasis of `S_y`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates of S_y**: The spin operator `S_y` is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix. Its eigenstates are:\n    *   `|+y>` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. `|+y> = (1/√2) (|+z> + i|-z>) = (1/√2) [1, i]^T`\n    *   `|-y>` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`. `|-y> = (1/√2) (|+z> - i|-z>) = (1/√2) [1, -i]^T`\n\n*   **Express Initial State in S_y basis**: We need to write our initial state `|+z>` as a combination of `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    By inspection or solving a system of equations, we find:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n*   **Apply the Time Evolution Operator**: Now we apply the operator `e^(iγBtS_y/ħ)` to this state. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y`, the operator acts simply on them:\n    `e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+y> = e^(iγBt(ħ/2)/ħ) |+y> = e^(iγBt/2) |+y>`\n    `e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |-y> = e^(iγBt(-ħ/2)/ħ) |-y> = e^(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n\n    Applying this to `|ψ(0)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y> + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y> ]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation of the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`.\n`<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ<S_z>(t)`\n\nLet's calculate `<S_z>(t)`. We need to express `|ψ(t)>` back in the Z-basis.\nLet `ω = γB/2`.\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iωt) (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iωt) (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (e^(iωt) + e^(-iωt))|+z> + i(e^(iωt) - e^(-iωt))|-z> ]`\nUsing Euler's formulas, `cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i)`:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (2cos(ωt))|+z> + i(2isin(ωt))|-z> ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt)|+z> - sin(ωt)|-z>`\nIn vector form: `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt), -sin(ωt)]^T`.\n\nNow we can calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z>(t) = [cos(ωt), -sin(ωt)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(ωt), -sin(ωt)]^T`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt), -sin(ωt)] * [cos(ωt), sin(ωt)]^T`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt) - sin²(ωt))`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2ωt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(2ωt)`\n\nSubstitute back `ω = γB/2`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(2 * (γB/2) * t)`\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos((γB)t)`\n\nThe time-dependent part of this expression is `cos((γB)t)`. An oscillation of the form `cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency of `Ω`.\nBy comparing the forms, we see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `Ω_L = γB`. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis therefore oscillates at this same frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols for the physical quantities\ngamma, B, t = sympy.symbols('gamma B t', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# From the quantum mechanical derivation, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment\n# oscillates according to the function cos(gamma * B * t).\n# The general form of an oscillation is cos(Omega * t), where Omega is the angular frequency.\n# We can identify the frequency by inspecting the argument of the cosine function.\n\n# The argument of the cosine is (gamma * B * t)\nargument = gamma * B * t\n\n# The oscillation frequency (Omega) is the coefficient of t in the argument.\noscillation_frequency = argument / t\n\n# Print the result\nprint(oscillation_frequency)\n```\nThe code interpreter will execute the python script.\nThe script defines the expression for the oscillation and extracts the frequency.\nThe expression `gamma * B * t / t` simplifies to `gamma * B`.\nThis confirms that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a particle's magnetic moment after a sudden change in the magnetic field direction. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem involving spin dynamics and time evolution.\n\n### **1. Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2. Its spin state is described by a spinor.\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the spin operator is `S_z`.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_down = +γ(ħ/2)B`.\n*   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### **2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (t > 0)**\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_y B`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(i(γBt/ħ)S_y) |+z>`.\n*   This operator `exp(i(γBt/ħ)S_y)` represents a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = -γBt`.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Expectation Value**\n\nWe need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n`<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can calculate this using the Heisenberg picture, where the operators evolve in time and the state remains fixed. The time-evolved `S_z` operator is:\n`S_z(t) = U(t)† S_z U(t)`, where `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/ħ)S_y)`.\nThis corresponds to rotating the `S_z` operator around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The rotation of a vector operator `(S_x, S_y, S_z)` around the y-axis gives:\n`S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`\n\nNow, we compute the expectation value using the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`:\n`<S_z>(t) = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt) <+z| S_z |+z> - sin(γBt) <+z| S_x |+z>`\n\nWe use the known expectation values for a spin-up state:\n*   `<+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2` (The state is an eigenstate of `S_z`).\n*   `<+z| S_x |+z> = 0` (The expectation value of `S_x` in an `S_z` eigenstate is zero).\n\nSubstituting these values:\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) - sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### **4.

An oscillation of the form `cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency `Ω`.

By comparing this to our result, we can see the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a simple symbolic script.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for the physical quantities.\ngamma, B, t = sympy.symbols('gamma B t', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# The time-dependent part of the expectation value is cos(gamma * B * t).\n# The general form of an oscillation is cos(Omega * t), where Omega is the angular frequency.\n# The argument of the cosine function is:\nargument = gamma * B * t\n\n# The oscillation frequency, Omega, is the coefficient of the time variable 't'.\n# We can extract it by dividing the argument by t.\noscillation_frequency = argument / t\n\n# Print the resulting frequency.\nprint(oscillation_frequency)\n```\nThe code output `B*gamma` confirms that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
