    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq_4 / T_eq_2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms are constant for both planets and can be canceled out:\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) and radius (R_star) are the same for both planets.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2).\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (1 / a_4)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n    This shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    T² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n    a ∝ T^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_4):\n    a_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now, substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [ (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    By applying the power rule for exponents ((x^m)^n = x^(m*n)), we get:\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (T_2 / T_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: T1:T2:T3:T4:T5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the specific ratio of T_2 to T_4:\n    T_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation and calculate the result.\n    T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    To perform this calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is 2:3.5.\nperiod_ratio_T2_T4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq_4 / T_eq_2) is equal to (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3).\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_T2_T4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`) by the following proportionality:\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) is:\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n\nUsing the power rule for exponents ((x^m)^n = x^(m*n)), we simplify the expression:\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nFinally, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe Python code calculated this value as approximately 0.8298.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.69\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
