    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a substituted cyclohexanone, which can act as a nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n        *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, leading to a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The enolate is the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon (C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n        *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting intermediate is an enolate of the ester. It gets protonated during the reaction or workup to yield the final product. The group `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` is now attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n    *   The final product has the `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to C6 of the 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one ring.\n    *   To name the product according to the options provided, the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The main chain is **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon-3 of this chain.\n    *   We need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is given the locant 1. So, the original C6 of the ketone is now C1 of the substituent name.\n    *   Let's number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants:\n        *   **C1 (old C6):** Point of attachment, also has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **C2 (old C1):** Has the ketone's carbonyl group, so it's an **oxo** substituent.\n        *   **C3 (old C2):** Has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons (on C1) are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, another excellent Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** The base (OH⁻) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n        *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n        *   The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n        *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion intermediate is protonated by water (the solvent) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   The resulting molecule is formed by connecting the two pieces: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The nitrile carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing C1 is six carbons long. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe only option where both products are correctly identified is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
