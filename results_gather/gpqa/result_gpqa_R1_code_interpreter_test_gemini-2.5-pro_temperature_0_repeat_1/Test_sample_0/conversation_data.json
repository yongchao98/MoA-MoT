    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt, which we can take as the lifetime τ) is on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    *   The formula is: ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2.\n    *   A common and practical approximation used for calculating the energy width (full width at half maximum, Γ) of a state is Γ ≈ ħ/τ. This energy width, ΔE, represents the inherent \"fuzziness\" or spread in the energy of the state due to its finite lifetime. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units that are convenient for this problem, which is electron-volts times seconds (eV·s).\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Energy Width) for Each State:**\n    *   For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s):\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s):\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" the Energy Levels:**\n    *   To distinguish two energy levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the energy uncertainty associated with them.\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁). This larger uncertainty is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the levels.\n    *   A conservative criterion for the levels to be \"clearly resolved\" is that their separation must be greater than the *sum* of their individual energy widths: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   Let's calculate this sum:\n        Total Uncertainty ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        Total Uncertainty ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, to clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare the Required Energy Difference with the Given Options:**\n    *   We need to find an option for |E₁ - E₂| that is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option A provides an energy difference large enough to overcome the combined energy uncertainties of the two states.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define constants and given values\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\ntau1 = 1e-9          # Lifetime of state 1 in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8          # Lifetime of state 2 in seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy difference\n# must be greater than their combined energy widths.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference to resolve them: > {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Check which option satisfies this condition\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is too small to be resolved.\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.
