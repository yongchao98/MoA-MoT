    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (specifically, bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para*-bromo derivative among the monobrominated products. This is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and its directing influence (ortho, para, or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃ (methyl)**: Activating\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅ (ethyl)**: Activating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can participate in resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅ (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating\n    *   4) **-NO₂ (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating\n\n### **3. Analyze the Groups with Low Para-Yield (Meta-Directors)**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the ortho and para isomers will be very low. To rank them, we consider their deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more pronounced the meta-direction, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\n*   **-NO₂ (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2)** is also a deactivator, but slightly weaker than -COOH because the ethyl group is weakly electron-donating to the carboxyl system.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this set is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **4. Analyze the Groups with High Para-Yield (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\n\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce a mixture of ortho and para isomers as the major products. The ratio between the para and ortho isomers determines their rank. The para position is generally favored over the ortho position due to reduced steric hindrance.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer for Toluene (1) < Yield of para-isomer for Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director. For halogenated benzenes (especially F, Cl, Br), the para-isomer is typically highly favored in electrophilic substitutions. Experimental data for bromination shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high percentage of the para-product (around 87%), which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene (~70%).\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this set is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### **5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nThe meta-directing groups will always produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing groups. By combining the two ranked sets, we get the final overall order.\n\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n### **6. Match with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived order with the choices provided:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOur calculated order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
