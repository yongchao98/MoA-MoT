    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the 1H NMR Signals:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** The signal is a singlet, which means these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)-O-). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** The signal is a doublet, which means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group, i.e., a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH₃). The doublet multiplicity confirms it's adjacent to a single proton on the double bond.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton on a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** This means \"doublet of quartets\". This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part arises from coupling to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part arises from coupling to three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   This confirms the structural fragment: **-CH=CH-CH₃**. The proton at 5.5 ppm is the one in the middle (`=CH-`).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the final single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also a vinylic proton. Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group. This confirms the fragment **-O-CH=CH-**.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** It's a doublet, confirming it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond depends on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J is smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for **trans** geometry.\n\n**2. Assembling the Structure and Conclusion:**\n\n*   From the signals, we have identified the following fragments: an acetate group (CH₃COO-), and a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the oxygen.\n*   The complete structure is **CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃**. This corresponds to the \"propenyl acetate\" options, ruling out the \"butenyl acetate\" options (which would have a CH₃CH₂- group instead of a CH₃- group at the end of the chain).\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) definitively establishes that they are in a **trans** configuration relative to each other.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nFinal check:\n*   **Structure:** Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃)\n*   **Acetate CH₃:** Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches)\n*   **Vinylic H next to O:** Doublet, downfield at ~7.0 ppm, J ≈ 16 Hz. (Matches)\n*   **Vinylic H next to CH₃:** Doublet of quartets at ~5.5 ppm. (Matches)\n*   **Terminal CH₃:** Doublet at ~1.6 ppm. (Matches)\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
