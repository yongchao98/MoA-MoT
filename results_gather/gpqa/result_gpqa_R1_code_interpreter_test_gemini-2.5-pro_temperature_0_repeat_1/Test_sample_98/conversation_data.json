    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This frequency is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most discriminating information comes from the proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectrum.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet).\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet).\n    *   Another set of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the molecule that has protons matching both of these complex splitting patterns. The analysis assumes standard 3-bond (vicinal) coupling. Let's interpret the condensed formulas as linear chains with the specified substituents.\n\n*   **A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n                       Et (CH2(h)-CH3(i))\n                       |\n    COOH - CH2(d) - CH(c) - CH(b) - CH3(a)\n                       |\n                       Et (CH2(f)-CH3(g))\n    ```\n    *   **Consider proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H), the CH3 group H(a) (3H), and the CH2 group of its ethyl substituent, H(h) (2H). This proton's signal will be split into a **doublet** (by H(c)), a **quartet** (by H(a)), and a **triplet** (by H(h)). This results in a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)** or **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Consider proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H), the adjacent CH2 group H(d) (2H), and the CH2 group of its ethyl substituent, H(f) (2H). This proton's signal will be split into a **doublet** (by H(b)), a **triplet** (by H(d)), and another **triplet** (by H(f)). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Molecule A contains protons that match both described splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtt` signal (the proton at C3), but it does not have a proton that would give a `dtq` signal. Instead, it would show complex `ddq` (doublet of doublet of quartets) signals from the diastereotopic CH2 protons.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtq` signal (the proton at C3), but it does not have a proton that would give a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtq` signal (the proton at C3), but it does not have a proton that would give a `dtt` signal.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons that would produce both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nTo confirm this analysis, the following Python code simulates the counting of neighboring protons for the key methine (CH) groups in each structure.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_structure(name, structure_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the splitting patterns for protons in a given molecular structure.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the molecule.\n        structure_dict (dict): A dictionary representing the molecule's connectivity\n                               and the number of hydrogens on each carbon.\n                               Key: carbon label (e.g., 'C1', 'C2', 'C3a')\n                               Value: tuple (number of hydrogens, list of connected carbons)\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing {name} ---\")\n    \n    # Find all methine (CH) groups, as these are the most likely candidates for complex splitting\n    methine_protons = []\n    for carbon, (h_count, connections) in structure_dict.items():\n        if h_count == 1:\n            methine_protons.append(carbon)\n            \n    if not methine_protons:\n        print(\"No CH groups found.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Found CH groups at: {', '.join(methine_protons)}\")\n    \n    has_dtq = False\n    has_dtt = False\n\n    for ch_carbon in methine_protons:\n        neighbor_h_counts = []\n        connections = structure_dict[ch_carbon][1]\n        \n        for neighbor_carbon in connections:\n            # We only consider vicinal coupling (3-bond) for this analysis.\n            # The carbon must exist in the structure dict.\n            if neighbor_carbon in structure_dict:\n                h_count = structure_dict[neighbor_carbon][0]\n                # We don't count the COOH proton for splitting.\n                if h_count > 0 and 'COOH' not in neighbor_carbon and 'C1' not in neighbor_carbon:\n                    neighbor_h_counts.append(h_count)\n        \n        neighbor_h_counts.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Check for dtq pattern: coupled to 3H, 2H, 1H\n        if sorted(neighbor_h_counts) == [1, 2, 3]:\n            print(f\"Proton at {ch_carbon} is coupled to groups with {neighbor_h_counts} protons.
