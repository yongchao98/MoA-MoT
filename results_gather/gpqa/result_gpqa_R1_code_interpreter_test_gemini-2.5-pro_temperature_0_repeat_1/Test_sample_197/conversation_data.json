    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co(II) ion and the various thiocyanato complexes.\n    *   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co²⁺]`) and the ligand (`[SCN⁻]`).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n5.  **Express Total Concentration in Terms of `[Co²⁺]`:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3.\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Define the Fraction of the Target Complex:** The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, denoted as `α₂`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n7.  **Derive the Formula for the Fraction (α₂):** Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)` into the fraction equation.\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n8.  **Check Assumptions:** The problem gives the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` and the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is much larger than the metal ion concentration (`0.1 M >> 0.01 M`), the amount of SCN⁻ consumed to form complexes is small. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as its initial total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Values:** Plug the given numbers into the formula for `α₂`.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    First, calculate the denominator:\n    `Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator:\n    `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n10. **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100.\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 16.916% is very close to option C) 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction formula (often denoted as Phi)\n# Phi = 1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the target complex [Co(SCN)2]\n# Numerator = beta2 * [L]^2\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nThe species in solution are the free `Co²⁺` ion and the complexes formed with thiocyanate (`SCN⁻`):\n*   `Co²⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the species of interest)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Express complex concentrations using stability constants (β):**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (β):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**4. Formulate the fraction of the target complex:**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total metal concentration. We are interested in `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Perform the calculation:**\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the ligand concentration is 10 times the total metal concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as the total ligand concentration).\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, sum them to get the denominator:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (`16.916...%`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
