    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n- Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$): 2m\n- Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$): 0.6c in the positive x-direction\n- Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$): 3m\n- Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$): 0.5c in the positive x-direction\n- c: speed of light\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds along the same line, the formula for relative velocity is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the options, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2$\n\n**a) Calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n- First, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$ for $v_1 = 0.6c$:\n  $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n- Now, calculate $E_1$:\n  $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**b) Calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n- First, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$ for $v_2 = 0.5c$:\n  $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n- Now, calculate $E_2$:\n  $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**c) Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n- Sum the energies $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n  $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n- To compare with the options, calculate the numerical value. Use $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n  $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n- Rounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants (velocities in units of c, masses in units of m)\nv1 = 0.6\nm1 = 2.0\nv2 = 0.5\nm2 = 3.0\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\n# v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2)\nv_rel_c = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n\n# E_total = (gamma1*m1 + gamma2*m2) * mc^2\n# We calculate the factor in front of mc^2\ntotal_energy_factor = gamma1 * m1 + gamma2 * m2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed (in units of c): {v_rel_c:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (in units of mc^2): {total_energy_factor:.2f}\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Relative speed (in units of c): 0.14\n> Total energy (in units of mc^2): 5.96\n\n**5.
