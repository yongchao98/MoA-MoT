    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The intensity ratio of the M+ peak (m/z 156) to the M+2 peak (m/z 158) is 100:32, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is roughly 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the proposed structures.\n\n```python\n# Molecular weights of common atoms\natomic_weights = {\n    'C': 12.011,\n    'H': 1.008,\n    'O': 15.999,\n    'Cl': 35.453 # Using the average weight for general calculation, but for MS we consider isotopes\n}\n\n# Isotopic masses\nisotope_weights = {\n    'C': 12.000,\n    'H': 1.008,\n    'O': 15.995,\n    'Cl35': 34.969\n}\n\n# Formulas for the options\nformulas = {\n    \"A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid\": {'C': 7, 'H': 5, 'Cl35': 1, 'O': 2},\n    \"B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid\": {'C': 7, 'H': 5, 'Cl35': 1, 'O': 2},\n    \"C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\": {'C': 7, 'H': 5, 'Cl35': 1, 'O': 2},\n    \"D) Phenyl chloroformate\": {'C': 7, 'H': 5, 'Cl35': 1, 'O': 2}\n}\n\n# Calculate the molecular weight for the 35Cl isotope for each option\nfor name, formula in formulas.items():\n    mw = 0\n    for atom, count in formula.items():\n        mw += isotope_weights[atom] * count\n    print(f\"Molecular Weight of {name} (with 35Cl): {round(mw, 2)}\")\n```\nThe code confirms that all four options have a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight that rounds to 156 when using the ³⁵Cl isotope. Therefore, the MS data alone is not sufficient to distinguish between them, but it confirms the elemental composition is plausible for all candidates.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the C=O of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option C (an aldehyde/phenol) and option D (a chloroformate), which would not show the characteristic broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. We are now left with options A and B.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' indicates it is a singlet (it does not couple with other protons), and '1H' confirms it is a single proton. This further supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The key information here is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.\n\n**4. Final Evaluation of Remaining Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) benzene ring. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals, likely multiplets), not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. It has an axis of symmetry running through the chlorine and the carboxylic acid group. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are equivalent and would appear as one doublet. The two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and would appear as a second doublet. This structure perfectly matches the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral data converge on a single structure. The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR aromatic pattern definitively points to a para-substituted benzene ring. Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An analysis of the spectral data leads to the following conclusions:\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This 100:32 ratio (approximately 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   The Python code confirmed that all four options have a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of 156 g/mol when using the ³⁵Cl isotope. Thus, the MS data confirms the molecular formula but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   The very broad absorption spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic and definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group is strongly indicated. This eliminates option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and option D (Phenyl chloroformate, which is a chloroformate and lacks an O-H group). We are left with options A and B, both of which are chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each representing two protons. This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The molecule has an axis of symmetry, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other.\n    *   **Option A (2-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *ortho*-substituted. It has no such symmetry, and its four aromatic protons would all be chemically different, leading to a much more complex spectrum (likely four separate signals).\n    *   **Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *para*-substituted. It has the required symmetry. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are equivalent and appear as one doublet. The two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and appear as the other doublet. This structure perfectly matches the observed NMR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll three pieces of spectroscopic evidence point to the same structure. The MS shows a compound with formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The IR and NMR confirm it is a carboxylic acid. The NMR splitting pattern proves it is a para-substituted benzene ring. Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
