    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We are given the time elapsed in the moving reference frame (the ejecta) and asked to find the distance traveled as measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The ejecta's reference frame (S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` compared to the time `Δt'` measured in the ejecta's frame (S').\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   So, the overall plan is:\n        a. Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n        b. Use `γ` to find the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n        c. Use `Δt` to calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Execute the calculations:**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n        *   First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n            `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n            `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt)**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d)**\n        *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    To get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d)\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option D, 3,060,000 km. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`.
