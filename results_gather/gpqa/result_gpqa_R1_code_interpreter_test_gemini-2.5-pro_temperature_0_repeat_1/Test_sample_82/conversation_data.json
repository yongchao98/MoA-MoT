    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (Dilution)**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as: Moles = Concentration × Volume.\n    *   Initial Moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n*   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution (which will be titrated) is:\n    *   New Concentration (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Analyze the Titration Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is between a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH).\n    *   CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   We are given:\n    *   Concentration of acetic acid (Ca) = 0.025 M\n    *   Volume of acetic acid (Va) = 40.00 mL = 0.04000 L\n    *   Concentration of NaOH (Cb) = 0.1 M\n    *   Acid dissociation constant for acetic acid (Ka) = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Find the volume to reach the equivalence point (Veq):** At the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base.\n    *   Moles of acid = Ca × Va = 0.025 M × 40.00 mL = 1.00 mmol.\n    *   Moles of base = Cb × Veq\n    *   1.00 mmol = 0.1 M × Veq\n    *   Veq = 1.00 mmol / 0.1 M = 10.00 mL.\n*   **Determine the state at 25% titration:** This means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × Veq = 0.25 × 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL.\n*   **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** At this stage, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid.

    "This problem involves a two-step process: first, the dilution of acetic acid, and second, the titration of the diluted acid with a strong base, NaOH. We need to calculate the pH at two specific points during the titration.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   New total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water:\n    *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   New concentration of acetic acid (Ca):\n    *   Ca = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles of conjugate base to acid is 25/75, or 1/3. The volume is the same for both species, so the concentration ratio is also 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n    *   A more precise calculation gives: pH = -log(1.85e-5) + log(1/3) ≈ 4.26\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (Veq):\n    *   Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    *   Ca × Va = Cb × Veq\n    *   (0.025 M) × (40.00 mL) = (0.1 M) × Veq\n    *   Veq = (0.025 × 40.00) / 0.1 = 10.00 mL\n*   Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Va + Veq = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.05000 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at this point. The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol).\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻] (let [OH⁻] = x):\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
