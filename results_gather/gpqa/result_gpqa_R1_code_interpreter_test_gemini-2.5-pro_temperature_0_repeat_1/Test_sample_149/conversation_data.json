    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C₈H₉NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (like C=C or C=O) or a ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the coupling to the aldehyde proton. So, we have an ethyl-aldehyde fragment (-CH₂-CHO).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (typical aromatic protons are > 7 ppm), which indicates the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH₂). An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amine group (-NH₂) and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is therefore **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + NH₂ + CH₂CHO = C₈H(4+2+2+1)NO = C₈H₉NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n\n1.  **Reagents: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This is a diazotization reaction. A primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C, implied) to form a diazonium salt.\n    The -NH₂ group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *Intermediate A:* 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n2.  **Reagent: 2. H₂O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it up (often just letting it warm to room temp or gentle heating) causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas. This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *Intermediate B:* 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n\n3.  **Reagents: 3. aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating intermediate B, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. Intermediate B is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form an enolate.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n        c.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form the aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n        d.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons. The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is thermodynamically very stable due to the extended conjugation between the new C=C double bond, the C=O bond of the aldehyde, and the aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (should be hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This structure perfectly matches the predicted final product from the self-aldol condensation reaction.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; this is not a product of self-condensation.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions, which favor condensation.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
