    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside it, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is displaced by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A point charge $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field $E$ at a point P located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the charge $+q$, accumulating on the inner surface of the cavity. This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface.\n    *   To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    *   So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Charge must be conserved. Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain neutrality. This positive charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    *   Let $q_{outer}$ be the charge on the outer surface. The total charge of the conductor is $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting $q_{inner} = -q$, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$, which means $q_{outer} = +q$.\n    *   So, a charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The electric field at any point is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges. In our case, the field at point P is the sum of the fields from:\n    a) The point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    b) The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    c) The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n    A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The combined electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P (which is outside the conductor) is due *only* to the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:** The charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other charges or fields external to the conductor, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface of radius $R$.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's position and size ($r, s$) and the position of point P relative to the cavity ($l, \\theta$) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor. The conductor's shielding effect simplifies the problem significantly. The external field only depends on the total charge placed inside the cavity and the distance from the center of the *conductor*.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
