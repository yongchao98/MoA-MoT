    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio for Planet1 and Planet2.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and will cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term will also cancel out.\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Given Data:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $K = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} c$\n\n6.  **Recall the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude induced on the star is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n\n7.  **Use Additional Information to Simplify:** The problem states the planets were detected using the transit method. This implies that we are viewing the system nearly edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\n8.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express 'a' in terms of the other variables.\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n9.  **Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n10. **Relate K Ratio to Doppler Shift Ratio:** Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ (as $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constants), the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n11. **Substitute and Combine:** Substitute the Doppler shift ratio into the semi-major axis ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n12. **Final Expression for Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2}$\n    Taking the square root simplifies the expression to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n13. **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n14. **Use Python for the final calculation.**\n\n```python\n# Planet 1 data\nM1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2 data\nM2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2/M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n# This is derived from T_eq ~ a^(-1/2) and a ~ (M_p / K)^2, where K ~ delta_lambda.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio = M2 / M1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357.

    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same and cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that the planets were also detected using the transit method. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which means $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{ \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 G}{K_2^2 M_{star}} }{ \\frac{M_{p,1}^2 G}{K_1^2 M_{star}} }$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets and cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Relating RV Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$)**\n\nThe RV amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nTherefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2}$\n\nThe square and the square root cancel, leaving:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nLet's perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by the formula:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemperature_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe code output `0.5357142857142857` is approximately 0.536.
