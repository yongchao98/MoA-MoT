    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (in the alpha position) to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Analysis of the compounds:**\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring and two carbonyl groups (C=O) at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bonds (C=C). To satisfy the valency of four, these carbons are bonded to another carbon in the ring (via a single bond), another carbon in the ring (via a double bond), and the carbonyl carbon. They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at C1 and C3.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. It tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n**Result for Part 1:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**, meaning its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of the compounds:**\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Analysis of Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group.\n        *   Group 1: A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   Group 2: A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   Group 3: A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   Group 4: A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis of Chiral Center:** The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups (not four), so they cannot be chiral centers. The carbons in the methyl groups are bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. The carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has no chiral center. It is also a planar molecule with a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part 2:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
