    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 2 vs. level 1) changes when a star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This can be expressed as:\n    Factor = (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots)\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Under this condition, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (E1 and E2) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2, respectively.\n    *   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   E₁ and E₂ are the energies of the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let R_unspotted be the ratio when the star has no spots, at temperature T_unspotted = 6000 K.\n    R_unspotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_unspotted)]\n\n    Let R_spotted be the ratio when the star has spots, at temperature T_spotted = 5500 K.\n    R_spotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spotted)]\n\n4.  **Calculate the Factor:** The factor is the ratio of R_unspotted to R_spotted.\n    Factor = R_unspotted / R_spotted\n    Factor = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_unspotted)] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spotted)] }\n\n    The statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), we get:\n    Factor = exp[ -(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_unspotted) + (E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spotted) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (E₂ - E₁) / k * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n5.  **Determine the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁):**\n    The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The energy of a photon is given by:\n    ΔE = E₂ - E₁ = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ is the wavelength.\n\n    We can substitute this into our factor equation:\n    Factor = exp[ (h * c) / (k * λ) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Now, we plug in the values. It's convenient to calculate the terms separately.\n\n    *   **Temperatures:**\n        T_unspotted = 6000 K\n        T_spotted = 5500 K\n    *   **Wavelength:**\n        λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n    *   **Constants:**\n        h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        c ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s\n        k ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Let's compute the exponent term by term.\n    *   (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (12 - 11) / 66000 = 1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n    *   (h * c) / (k * λ) = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ * 3.0 × 10⁸) / (1.38 × 10⁻²³ * 1.448 × 10⁻⁷) ≈ 99478 K\n\n    Now, calculate the full exponent:\n    Exponent = 99478 K * (1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.507\n\n    Finally, calculate the factor:\n    Factor = exp(1.507) ≈ 4.51\n\n    The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is extraneous, as the effective temperatures for both the spotted and unspotted states are provided directly.\n\n7.  **Final Check with a Python Script:** To ensure accuracy, we can use a script to perform the calculation with high-precision constants.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values\nlambda_A = 1448.0      # Wavelength in Angstroms\nlambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10 # Wavelength in meters\nT_unspotted = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spotted = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the factor equation\n# Exponent = (h * c / (k * lambda_m)) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)\nexponent = (h * c / (k * lambda_m)) * (1.0/T_spotted - 1.0/T_unspotted)\n\n# Calculate the factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<execute_code>\n4.506300031101141\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.506.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star's effective temperature changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures.\n\n**1. Identify the governing physical principle:**\nThe population of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2.\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constants for these specific levels).\n*   E₁ and E₂ are the energies of the levels.\n*   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Set up the ratios for the two scenarios:**\nLet R_unspotted be the population ratio when the star has no spots, with an effective temperature T_unspotted = 6000 K.\nR_unspotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)]\n\nLet R_spotted be the population ratio when the star has spots, with an effective temperature T_spotted = 5500 K.\nR_spotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)]\n\n**3. Determine the factor:**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the two ratios:\n\nFactor = R_unspotted / R_spotted\nFactor = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)] }\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), we get:\n\nFactor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_unspotted) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]\nFactor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_unspotted) + ΔE / (k * T_spotted) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n**4. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The energy of a photon is given by the formula:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ is the wavelength.\n\nSubstituting this into our factor equation:\n\nFactor = exp[ (h * c / (k * λ)) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n**5. Perform the calculation:**\nWe have all the necessary values:\n*   T_unspotted = 6000 K\n*   T_spotted = 5500 K\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   k ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nThe calculation was performed using the provided Python script, which yielded a result of approximately 4.506.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated factor is ~4.5. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~1.1\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~7.8\n\nThe result matches option A. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage was not needed for the calculation as the effective temperatures for both states were given.\n\n<<<A>>>"
