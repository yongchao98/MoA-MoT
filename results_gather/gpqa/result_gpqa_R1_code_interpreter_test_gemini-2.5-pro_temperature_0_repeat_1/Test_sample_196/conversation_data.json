    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption from `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at `1720 cm-1` is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, suggesting it is ortho (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting it is ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   Now let's determine the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is likely the -CH₂ group adjacent to the -CH₃ group (making it a quartet) and also adjacent to another group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the -CH group. It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic and shifting it downfield), the -CH₃ group (splitting it into a quartet), and the -CH₂ group (splitting it into a triplet). The combination results in a complex multiplet.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments are an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃), both attached to a methine (-CH-) carbon. This methine carbon is attached to the benzene ring. The resulting alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (D), but the question asks for the final product of the reaction, not the identity of Compound X.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents (Red P / HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces aldehydes, ketones, and alcohol hydroxyl groups to alkanes.\n3.  **Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 of the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 and the aromatic ring itself will not be affected by these reagents.\n    *   Product: The resulting molecule will have a methyl group at position 1 and a *sec*-butyl group at position 4. The name of this compound is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the reaction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\nB) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct.\nC) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\nD) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
