    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to find which of the five listed stars can be observed by *both* the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory.\n\n2.  **Identify the Constraints:** There are two main types of constraints for a star to be observable by both instruments:\n    *   **Location Constraint:** The star must be visible in the sky from both observatory locations. Since the problem asks to disregard specific pointing limits and altitudes, the fundamental constraint is that the star must rise above the horizon at each site. An observatory at latitude `lat` can observe objects with a declination (DEC) between `lat - 90°` and `lat + 90°`.\n    *   **Brightness Constraint:** The star's apparent V magnitude (V) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Constraints in Detail:**\n\n    *   **Location Constraints:**\n        *   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** The Wikipedia link shows its latitude is approximately 24°37′ S, which is -24.6°. A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern horizon limit (`-90°`) and south of the northern horizon limit. The critical limit for a southern observatory is the northern one: `DEC < 90° + lat` => `DEC < 90° - 24.6°` => `DEC < 65.4°`.\n        *   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** The Wikipedia link shows its latitude is approximately 19°49′ N, which is +19.8°. The critical limit for a northern observatory is the southern one: `DEC > lat - 90°` => `DEC > 19.8° - 90°` => `DEC > -70.2°`.\n        *   **Combined Location Constraint:** For a star to be seen by both, its declination must satisfy: **-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°**.\n\n    *   **Brightness Constraints:**\n        *   **ESPRESSO:** Apparent V magnitude `V < 17.0`.\n        *   **HIRES:** Apparent V magnitude `V < 16.0`.\n        *   **Combined Brightness Constraint:** To be observed by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit: **V < 16.0**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Star:** Now, I will check each star against these combined constraints. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given directly, I'll use the distance modulus formula:\n    `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n    where `V` is the apparent magnitude, `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the extinction in the V band. The extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n    *   **Star 1:**\n        *   DEC = -75°. This is outside the Keck limit (`-75°` is not > `-70.2°`).\n        *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n    *   **Star 2:**\n        *   DEC = 55°. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. (Location: OK)\n        *   Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5. This does not meet the combined brightness limit (`16.5` is not < `16.0`).\n        *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n    *   **Star 3:**\n        *   DEC = 48°. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. (Location: OK)\n        *   Apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. This meets the combined brightness limit (`15.5 < 16.0`). The other information (E(B-V), distance) is consistent with this value but not needed for the check.\n        *   *Conclusion: Observable by both.*\n\n    *   **Star 4:**\n        *   DEC = -48°. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. (Location: OK)\n        *   Need to calculate V:\n            *   `M_V = 15.5`, `d = 10 pc`, `E(B-V) = 0.4`.\n            *   `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24`.\n            *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74`.\n        *   The calculated apparent magnitude `V = 16.74` does not meet the combined brightness limit (`16.74` is not < `16.0`).\n        *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n    *   **Star 5:**\n        *   DEC = 60°. This is within the range [-70.2°, 65.4°]. (Location: OK)\n        *   Need to calculate V:\n            *   `M_V = 16.5`, `d = 5 pc`, `E(B-V) = 0` (not mentioned, so `A_V = 0`).\n            *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0`.\n            *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995`.\n        *   The calculated apparent magnitude `V ≈ 15.0` meets the combined brightness limit (`15.0 < 16.0`).\n        *   *Conclusion: Observable by both.*\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The analysis shows that Star 3 and Star 5 are the only ones that satisfy both the location and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\nTo be certain, I will use a Python script to perform the calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star_observability(star_name, dec, V=None, M_V=None, d=None, E_BV=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n    Args:\n        star_name (str): The name of the star.\n        dec (float): Declination in degrees.\n        V (float, optional): Apparent V magnitude.\n        M_V (float, optional): Absolute V magnitude.\n        d (float, optional): Distance in parsecs.\n        E_BV (float, optional): Color excess E(B-V).\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if observable by both, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Observatory parameters\n    paranal_lat = -24.627  # Paranal Observatory latitude\n    keck_lat = 19.826      # Keck Observatory latitude\n    combined_V_limit = 16.0 # Stricter magnitude limit (HIRES)\n\n    # 1.

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Location Condition:** The star must be visible from both observatories. Since we are ignoring pointing limits, this means the star's declination (DEC) must be within the observable range of both sites.\n    *   Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. It can observe stars with declinations north of its southern celestial pole and south of its northern horizon, which is at a declination of 90° + (-24.6°) = 65.4°. So, for Paranal, **DEC < 65.4°**.\n    *   Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. It can observe stars with declinations south of its northern celestial pole and north of its southern horizon, which is at a declination of -90° + 19.8° = -70.2°. So, for Keck, **DEC > -70.2°**.\n    *   For a star to be visible from both, its declination must be in the range **-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness Condition:** The star's apparent V magnitude (V) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17.0 mag\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16.0 mag\n    *   To be observed by both, the star must satisfy the stricter limit: **V < 16.0 mag**.\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude (V) is not given, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula:\nV = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V\nwhere M_V is the absolute magnitude, d is the distance in parsecs, and A_V is the interstellar extinction. A_V is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°) as it is too far south for Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = 55°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = 48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate V.\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is not brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = 60°. This is within the required range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate V.\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, E(B-V) = 0 (not mentioned, so A_V = 0).\n        *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 can be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
