    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a **lactone**, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   The \"pyran\" part indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at position 2.\n*   The \"tetrahydro\" indicates a saturated ring.\n*   The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4.\n*   The chiral center is at C4, which is bonded to a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different CH2 groups within the ring.\n\nA six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a **5-hydroxy carboxylic acid**. The linear precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's trace the carbon chain:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The carbon chain `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5` and the hydroxyl oxygen form the ring.\n*   The C1 becomes the carbonyl carbon of the lactone (position 2 in IUPAC lactone nomenclature).\n*   The C3 of the acid chain, which is the chiral center, becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization process. An (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form an (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and an (S)-acid will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nStructure: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl groups that can be reduced. The key to solving the problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Selectivity:** When presented with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ is selective for the **ester**. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride (H⁻) to form a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻Li⁺), which is much less electrophilic and resistant to reduction by LiBH₄. The ester group, however, is readily reduced to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged (it is reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. LiBH₄, 2. H⁺)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl carbons, not at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane is a highly selective reagent that reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. BH₃, 2. H⁺)--> `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the final lactone (and isobutanol as a byproduct).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not involve the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
