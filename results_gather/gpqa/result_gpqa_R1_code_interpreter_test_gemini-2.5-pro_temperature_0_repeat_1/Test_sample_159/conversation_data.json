    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n1.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    The intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The intensity $I$ at an angle $\\theta$ from the central axis is given by:\n    $I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n    where:\n    *   $I_0$ is the intensity at the center of the pattern ($\\theta=0$).\n    *   $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$ is the wave number, with $\\lambda$ being the wavelength of the light.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   $\\theta$ is the angular position from the central maximum.\n\n2.  **Finding the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima occur when the numerator is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta) = 0$. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$, where $x = k a \\sin\\theta$. We are interested in the non-zero roots, as $x=0$ corresponds to the central maximum.\n\n3.  **Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    Let the non-zero roots of $J_1(x)$ be $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots$. The angular position $\\theta_n$ of the n-th minimum is given by:\n    $k a \\sin\\theta_n = x_n$\n    Substituting $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$, we get:\n    $\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda} \\sin\\theta_n = x_n$\n\n4.  **Small Angle Approximation:**\n    The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$.
