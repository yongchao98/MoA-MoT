    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. This decay happens not in a single step, but via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole transition. We need to find a valid intermediate state that forms a possible decay path and calculate the probability of the atom taking that specific path.\n\n### 2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers |n, l, m>:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number change is not restricted (but must decrease for emission).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>. The decay path is |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the final l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, the final m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   Applying Δn: n must decrease. Since it's a two-step process to reach n=1, the intermediate state must have n' < 3. The most likely transition is to the nearest available level, which is n'=2. So, n'=2.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2, 1, 0>\n*   |2, 1, 1>\n*   |2, 1, -1>\n\n**Second transition: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if our possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   Final state: n''=1, l''=0, m''=0.\n*   For all three intermediate states (|2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>), we have n'=2, l'=1.\n*   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'.\n    *   If m'=0, Δm=0. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=1, Δm=-1. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=-1, Δm=+1. (Allowed)\n\nSo, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade (a sequence of decays) is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\nP(route) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2)\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThe branching ratio is the probability of a specific decay channel compared to all possible decay channels. A state |2,1,m'> (a 2p state) can only decay to a lower energy level. The only lower energy level is n=1. For n=1, the only possible value for l is l=0. Thus, the only possible final state via a single-photon dipole transition is |1,0,0>. Since this is the only possible decay route, its branching ratio is 1.\n*   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific state |2,1,m'> is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total decay rate of the initial state |3,0,0>.\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Rate_total(|3,0,0>)\n\nThe dominant decay channel for the |3,0,0> (3s) state is to the |2,1,m'> (2p) states. Other decays, like the two-photon decay to 1s, are much slower and can be neglected.\n*   Rate_total(|3,0,0>) ≈ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. A key physical principle is that an initial state with l=0 (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when it decays by emitting a photon, the emission must be isotropic on average, meaning it has no preference for which m' sublevel to populate. This implies that the transition rates to each of the possible final m' states must be equal.\n*   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nLet's call this rate `R`. Then the total rate is `R + R + R = 3R`.\nThe branching ratio for the decay to any specific m' state is:\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = R / (3R) = 1/3\n\nThis can be formally verified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which show that the angular part of the transition matrix element has the same magnitude for all three final m' states when the initial state has l=0.\n\n**Total Probability for each Route**\nNow we can calculate the total probability for each of the three possible routes:\n*   P(route via m'=0) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=-1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3).\n*   B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3).\n*   C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3. (The route is valid, and the probability is correct).\n*   D) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
