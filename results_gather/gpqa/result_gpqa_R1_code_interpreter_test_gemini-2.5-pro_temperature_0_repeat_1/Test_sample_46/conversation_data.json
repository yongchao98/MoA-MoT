    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** functional group, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a simple saturated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the -CH₂- group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the fragments:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The two substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nLet's combine these pieces to form the final structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (C₆H₄ + NH₂ + COOCH₂CH₃ = C₉H₁₁NO₂) - **Matches**\n*   **IR:** Has a primary amine and an ester group. - **Matches**\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts. - **Matches**\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a primary amide (different C=O stretch) and is meta-substituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
