    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in relativistic mechanics. We need to use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to solve it.\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n    *   Initial momentum ($p_i$) = 0 (since it's stationary).\n    *   Initial energy ($E_i$) is its rest energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n*   **Final State:** A muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    *   Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$, and their total energies be $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Final momentum ($p_f$) = $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Final energy ($E_f$) = $E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n$p_i = p_f$\n$0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\nThis implies that $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$. The muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n$E_i = E_f$\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe can express the total energies of the final particles using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$), which has mass:\n    $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$), which is considered massless ($m_{\\nu}=0$):\n    $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (0)^2} = pc$.\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n**4.

Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n\nWe can now use a script to calculate the numerical values.\n\n*   First, we calculate `pc`. This value is the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$).\n*   Then, we calculate the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$). The total energy of the muon is $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$. Its kinetic energy is this total energy minus its rest mass energy: $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}) - m_{\\mu}c^2 = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term 'pc' in MeV\n# pc = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon can be found from energy conservation\n# KE_mu = E_total - E_nu - m_mu = m_pi - KE_nu - m_mu\nKE_mu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKinetic Energy of muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle into two other particles. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The initial particle is a stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n*   Since it is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_i$) is 0.\n*   Its initial total energy ($E_i$) is its rest mass energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The final particles are a muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$).\n*   Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$, and their total energies be $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after.\n$p_i = p_f$\n$0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\nThis implies that the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\n$E_i = E_f$\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$, to express the energies of the final particles.\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$), which is considered massless ($m_{\\nu}=0$): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nTo solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy), we rearrange and square the equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out. Solving for `pc`:\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\nThis value `pc` is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, $KE_{\\nu}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n$KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\nFrom energy conservation, $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$.\nTherefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}) - m_{\\mu}c^2 = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nUsing the given values:\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\nFirst, calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n$KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\nNow, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon:\n$KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 - 105.7 - 29.78 = 33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
