    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**Analysis of the Impulse Approximation:**\nThe impulse approximation simplifies a complex many-body problem (an interaction with a nucleus) into a simpler one. The core idea is that the interaction with the nucleus can be treated as a sum of interactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons. This is valid when the interaction is very fast and involves a large momentum transfer.\n\nLet's break down what \"behaving in the same way as free nucleons\" implies in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction target:** The external probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) must interact with a single nucleon, not with a correlated pair of nucleons or the nucleus as a whole. This is the essence of treating the process as a sum of individual events.\n2.  **The nucleon's state during interaction:** At the moment of the high-energy interaction, the nucleon should act as if it's not bound to the other nucleons. The interaction time is assumed to be much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. Therefore, the binding forces are considered negligible *during* the brief interaction.\n3.  **The \"spectator\" nucleus:** The rest of the nucleus should not interfere with the primary interaction. This means the incoming probe doesn't scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) don't re-interact with the remaining nucleons on their way out. This is often called the \"plane wave impulse approximation\" (PWIA), and the assumption is that the nucleus is transparent to the incoming and outgoing particles.\n\n**Evaluating the given assumptions:**\n\n*   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This directly corresponds to point 1 in our analysis. It excludes more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents, where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons. This is a fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. **This assumption is necessary.**\n\n*   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This corresponds to point 3 in our analysis. It means we neglect initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI), where the particles involved in the primary collision interact with the \"spectator\" nucleons. This is a key simplifying assumption to treat the event as a clean, single-nucleon knockout. **This assumption is necessary.**\n\n*   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This is an assumption about the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not about its behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation can be used in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks. For example, in deep inelastic scattering, the impulse approximation is used to describe the scattering off a quasi-free nucleon, but the subsequent scattering off the quarks (partons) is highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself. **This assumption is not necessary.**\n\n*   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This directly corresponds to point 2 in our analysis. It is the \"impulse\" concept: the interaction is so sudden that the nucleon's binding to the nucleus can be ignored for the duration of the event. The nucleon's initial momentum is given by its state in the nucleus, but its interaction dynamics are that of a free particle. **This assumption is necessary.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n*   Assumption 1 defines the target (a single nucleon).\n*   Assumption 4 defines the state of the target (free from binding forces during the interaction).\n*   Assumption 2 defines the environment (no interference from other nucleons).\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
