    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principles:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ_proper`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Set up the general equation:**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`.\n    *   They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity, which we can approximate as the speed of light, `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The number of particles `N` that reach the wall without decaying is given by the decay law, using the time and lifetime in the lab frame:\n        `N = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n        `N = N₀ * exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the detector is `N/N₀`:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the first condition:**\n    *   We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   So, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   Plugging these values into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ_proper))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown constant term `R / (c * τ_proper)`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ_proper)`\n        `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ_proper)`\n        `R / (c * τ_proper) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   This gives us a value for the constant part of the exponent, which depends only on the detector size and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second condition (the goal):**\n    *   We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   So, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   Using the same general equation:\n        `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`:**\n    *   We can rewrite the equation from step 4 as:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(1/γ₂) * (R / (c * τ_proper))`\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `R / (c * τ_proper)` that we found in step 3:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(1/γ₂) * (20 * ln(3))`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ * ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3)`\n        `γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / ln(2/3)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n        `γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / -ln(3/2)`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we can compute the value of the expression for `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2 based on the derived formula:\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nln3 = math.log(3)\nln2 = math.log(2)\n\ngamma_2 = (20 * ln3) / (ln3 - ln2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18843123344332\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The detector has a radius `R`. The time to reach the wall is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame (`τ_lab`):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting these into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`, as these values do not change between the two scenarios.\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Using the First Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (`1/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds (`2/3`) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n    Substitute the value of `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify this to:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
