    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe star's brightness changes as it rotates because one hemisphere is clear and the other has dark spots. We need to calculate the amplitude of this brightness variation.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when we observe the unspotted hemisphere. The flux is proportional to the projected area of the star's disk (`A_disk`) and the fourth power of its effective temperature (`T_eff`), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when we observe the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` of its area covered by cooler spots (`T_spot`) and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` at the normal effective temperature (`T_eff`).\n    *   The flux from the unspotted part of this hemisphere is `∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4`.\n    *   The flux from the spotted part is `∝ f * A_disk * T_spot^4`.\n    *   The total minimum flux is the sum of these two components:\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4 + f * A_disk * T_spot^4`\n        `F_min ∝ A_disk * [(1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4]`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the light curve is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux, normalized by the maximum flux.\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for `F_max` and `F_min`:\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [A_disk * ((1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4)] / [A_disk * T_eff^4]`\n    The `A_disk` term cancels out.\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n    `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\n**2. Understand the Brightness Drop due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. For a uniform, spotless star, this dip (or transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n*   `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2)`\n*   `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n**3. Equate the Two Effects and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius (`R_pl`) that would produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot variation amplitude.\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20      # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots.\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\nspot_amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# This amplitude is equal to the transit depth from a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# So, (R_pl / R_star)**2 = spot_amplitude\nRpl_over_Rstar_squared = spot_amplitude\n\n# Solve for the relative radius R_pl / R_star\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(Rpl_over_Rstar_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The amplitude of the spot-induced variation is: {spot_amplitude:.5f}\")\nprint(f\"The required relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {Rpl_over_Rstar:.5f}\")\n```\nThe code calculates the value of `R_pl / R_star` based on the derived formula. The result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots with the transit depth caused by a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation due to starspots.**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). We will compare the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible (minimum flux, `F_min`) to the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (maximum flux, `F_max`).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we see the unspotted hemisphere. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we see the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of its area covered by cooler spots and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` at the normal effective temperature.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`\n\nThe amplitude of the photometric variation is the relative change in flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n`Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n`Amplitude = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\n**Step 2: Define the transit depth of an exoplanet.**\n\nThe transit depth is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. It is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n**Step 3: Equate the spot amplitude and the transit depth and solve for R_pl / R_star.**\n\nThe problem requires the signal amplitudes to be the same.\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)^4]`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4]`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.10355`\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the relative radius:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nThe provided code output confirms this calculation:\n`The amplitude of the spot-induced variation is: 0.10355`\n`The required relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.32179`\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
