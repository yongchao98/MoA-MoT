    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`\n*   `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y`\n*   `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y`\n*   `1.7136x = 0.8572y`\n*   `y / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n*   This means the empirical formula is CH2, and the molecular formula is `CnH2n`.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The value 14.28% is exactly 1/7. For a `CnH2n` compound, the H% is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This confirms the formula type.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives only substance Z. This is a crucial clue. It means all components of both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which is the skeleton of the cycloalkane Z.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. Y does not decolorize bromine water. Z is a component of Y.\n*   Let's call the components of Y, Y1 and Y2. Let Y1 = Z = `CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n*   Y2 is also in mixture Y, so it doesn't decolorize bromine water (it's saturated or aromatic). Hydrogenation of Y2 gives Z (`CnH2n`). If Y2 were a different saturated isomer of Z, it wouldn't react with hydrogen. Therefore, Y2 must be a compound that can be hydrogenated to Z. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n*   This points to the Zelinsky disproportionation, where unsaturated cyclic compounds are converted into a mixture of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon.\n*   Let's test possible carbon skeletons:\n    *   **C5 skeleton:** Z would be cyclopentane (C5H10). The corresponding aromatic compound would need to be C5, but there is no stable, neutral aromatic C5 hydrocarbon. So, n≠5.\n    *   **C6 skeleton:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). Let's check if this fits.\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n        *   Does Y decolorize bromine water? No. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene does not react with bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Is Z (cyclohexane) a widely used solvent? Yes. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is unreactive. Benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (`C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`). So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   **C7 skeleton:** Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound is toluene (C7H8). This system also works by the same logic as the C6 system.\n    *   **C8 skeleton:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding unsaturated compound is cyclooctatetraene (C8H8). However, cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic and behaves as a polyene, readily decolorizing bromine water. This contradicts the properties of mixture Y. So, n≠8.\n\n*   The most plausible systems are the C6 and C7 systems. In the context of typical chemistry problems, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the fundamental and most common example of this type of reaction. We will proceed with the C6 system as the most likely intended answer.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated.\n*   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X1 and X2 gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means X1 and X2 are C6 unsaturated compounds with a six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that converts an equimolar mixture X into an equimolar mixture Y. This strongly suggests a 1:1 reaction: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n*   Substituting the components of Y we found: `X1 + X2 -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is oxidized to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   `X1 (acceptor) + 2H -> C6H12`. This implies X1 has 10 hydrogens, so its formula is C6H10. This is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   `X2 (donor) -> C6H6 + 2H`. This implies X2 has 8 hydrogens, so its formula is C6H8. This is a **cyclohexadiene**.\n*   The problem states there are no conjugated bonds in X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For C6H8, we must choose the non-conjugated isomer, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds).\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). All conditions are met.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
