    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The reaction is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Write the equilibrium constant expression:** The formation constant, $K_f$ (also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), is for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$). The expression is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The question asks for the concentration of calcium ions, which is 'x' at equilibrium.\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    $5.0 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Make a simplifying assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5.0 \\times 10^{10}$), which means the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. Therefore, very little of the complex will dissociate, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can assume that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Solve the simplified equation for x:**\n    $5.0 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x ($6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M) is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so the assumption was valid.\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the result with a more precise calculation without the approximation, we can solve the full quadratic equation: $5.0 \\times 10^{10} \\cdot x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nK_f = 5.0e10  # Formation constant\nC = 0.02      # Initial concentration of the complex\n\n# Solve the simplified equation: K_f = C / x^2\nx_simplified = math.sqrt(C / K_f)\nprint(f\"Result from simplified equation: {x_simplified:.2e} M\")\n\n# Solve the full quadratic equation: K_f*x^2 + x - C = 0\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\na = K_f\nb = 1\nc = -C\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nx_quadratic = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\nprint(f\"Result from quadratic equation: {x_quadratic:.2e} M\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

Therefore, 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The equation simplifies to:\n    $5.0 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C. The code execution output confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
