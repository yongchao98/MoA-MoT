    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Processing and Identify the Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by analyzing what happens in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Weight increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water, we use its molar mass (M(H₂O) ≈ 18.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (already removed) and not acidic. Common examples from salt decomposition are O₂, N₂O, or NO.\n    *   If the gas were O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Moles of O₂ would be 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   If the gas were N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. One mole of N₂O provides one mole of O. So, moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium salts at 200°C makes N₂O a more likely product than O₂. Let's proceed with the N₂O hypothesis and verify it.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is inert to all three tubes. Nitrogen (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n    *   If the reacting gas in tube 3 was 0.05 mol of N₂O, it would have produced 0.05 mol of N₂. The total remaining gas C (0.10 mol) must be the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ that was present from the initial decomposition.\n    *   Moles of N₂ from initial decomposition = Total N₂ (gas C) - N₂ from N₂O reduction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n**Summary of Decomposition Products:**\nBased on this analysis, the initial decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition and Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nNow we find the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the original salt mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** (0.05 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 2 N/N₂O) = 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 1 O/N₂O) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. The mass is correct.\n\nThe problem states the mixture of A and B is equimolar. The products (0.05 mol N₂ and 0.05 mol N₂O) also suggest the parent salts were in a 1:1 molar ratio. This means the elemental composition we found (H₀.₄₀N₀.₂₀O₀.₂₅) corresponds to the sum of the formulas of the two salts.\nTo find a simpler ratio, we can find the simplest whole number ratio of the moles: H:N:O = 0.40:0.20:0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives the integer ratio H₈:N₄:O₅.\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is H₈N₄O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) made of H, N, and O that add up to this formula. The decomposition products strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula H₄N₂O₂. Decomposes as NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula H₄N₂O₃. Decomposes at 200°C as NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's check if these are our salts A and B:\n*   Formula of A + Formula of B = (H₄N₂O₂) + (H₄N₂O₃) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis is a perfect match.\n\nSo, the two salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the molecular formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# --- Calculations Summary ---\n\n# Molar masses (approximate)\nM_H2O = 18.0\nM_O = 16.0\nMolar_volume_STP = 22.4\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / M_H2O\nmoles_O_in_tube3 = 0.80 / M_O\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_in_tube3\nmoles_gas_C = 2.24 / Molar_volume_STP\nmoles_N2_initial = moles_gas_C - moles_N2O\n\n# Identification of salts\n# The products are 0.2 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2, and 0.05 mol N2O.\n# This corresponds to the decomposition of an equimolar mixture (0.05 mol each) of:\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 (which gives N2 + 2H2O)\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 (which gives N2O + 2H2O)\n\n# Atom count\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O)\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O)\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Processing and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper acts as a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms.\n    *   The weight increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (already removed) and not acidic. A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO. Therefore, the moles of N₂O that reacted must be equal to the moles of oxygen atoms absorbed.\n    *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This reaction also produces nitrogen gas (N₂). The moles of N₂ produced in this tube are equal to the moles of N₂O reacted, so 0.05 mol of N₂ is formed here.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is the total amount of gas that did not react in any of the tubes. Given the context of decomposing nitrogen salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   This total of 0.10 mol of N₂ comes from two sources:\n        1.  N₂ that was produced in the initial decomposition of the salts.\n        2.  N₂ that was produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper in tube №3 (which we calculated to be 0.05 mol).\n    *   Therefore, the amount of N₂ from the initial decomposition is:\n        Moles of N₂ (initial) = Total N₂ - N₂ (from tube 3) = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n**2. Summarize Decomposition Products and Identify the Salts**\n\nThe initial decomposition of salts A and B produced a gas mixture consisting of:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. The fact that we have 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O strongly suggests that 0.05 mol of salt A decomposed to give N₂, and 0.05 mol of salt B decomposed to give N₂O.\n\nLet's identify the salts based on their decomposition products:\n*   **Salt A:** Decomposes to produce N₂ and H₂O. The classic reaction for this is the decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n    NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    If we start with 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂, we get 0.05 mol of N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol of H₂O.\n*   **Salt B:** Decomposes at 200°C to produce N₂O and H₂O. This is the characteristic decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):\n    NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n    If we start with 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃, we get 0.05 mol of N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol of H₂O.\n\nLet's check if the total products match our findings:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (Correct)\n*   Total N₂O = 0.05 mol (Correct)\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 mol (from A) + 0.10 mol (from B) = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n\nThe salts are indeed **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis can be verified with a simple script.\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# N: 1+1=2, H: 4, O: 2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# N: 1+1=2, H: 4, O: 3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Total atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"The total number of atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
