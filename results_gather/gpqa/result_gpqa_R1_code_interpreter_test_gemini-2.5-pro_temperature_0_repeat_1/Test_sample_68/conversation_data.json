    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle, $X^0$, that decays after traveling some distance in a bubble chamber. We need to find the minimum resolution of the detector required to observe at least 30% of these decays.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n*   **Decay Length:** The distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is the decay length. This is a random variable.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The probability that a particle survives for a certain time or travels a certain distance follows an exponential decay law.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance `L` that is at least as large as the detector's resolution. If it decays before traveling this distance, its track is too short to be resolved. We are given that at least 30% of the decays must be observed.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Equations\n\n**a. Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe total energy $E$ of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. In particle physics units where c=1, this is $E = \\gamma m_0$.\nGiven:\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n\nThe Lorentz factor is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0}$\n\n**b. Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$)**\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s is the proper lifetime.\n\n**c. Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\nThe velocity is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nSo, $\\lambda = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = (\\beta \\gamma) c \\tau_0$.\nA useful relativistic identity is $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nTherefore, the mean decay length is:\n$\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n**d. Probability of Observation**\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\nwhere `L` is the minimum distance required for observation (i.e., the detector resolution).\n\nWe are given that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which means:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge L) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n### 3. Calculation\nNow, we can substitute the values and calculate `L`. We will use a Python script for precision.\n\nThe steps for the script are:\n1.  Define the constants: $E$, $m_0$, $\\tau_0$, $c$.\n2.  Calculate $\\gamma = E / m_0$.\n3.  Calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n4.

The small discrepancy might arise from slightly different values for the physical constants (like the speed of light) or rounding in the problem statement's intended answer. However, the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m) and the leading digit are correct, making A the only plausible answer.\n\nLet's re-check the calculation with the value from option A to see what fraction it corresponds to.\nIf $L = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{(27/3.41)^2 - 1} \\approx 1.89 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nThen the fraction observed is $e^{-L/\\lambda} = e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.89 \\times 10^{-6})} = e^{-1.1} \\approx 0.33$.\nThis is consistent with the condition \"at least 30%\". The value in option A is a valid resolution that satisfies the condition.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This means we need to find the maximum track length, $L$, that the particle can travel such that we still observe at least 30% of the decays. A particle's decay is \"observed\" if it travels a distance greater than or equal to the detector's resolution.\n\n### 1. Relativistic Kinematics\nFirst, we need to account for relativistic effects since the particle has a high energy compared to its rest mass. We calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\nThe total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its rest mass $m_0$ and its Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.

This is the particle's velocity in the lab frame, $v$, multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau$.\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n\nThe velocity is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nA more direct way to calculate the decay length is using the relativistic momentum term $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n$\\lambda = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\tau_0 (\\beta\\gamma) = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n### 3. Exponential Decay Law\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying follows an exponential distribution:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\nwhere $L$ is the minimum distance for observation (the resolution) and $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length.\n\nWe are given that at least 30% of the decays must be observed. This sets the condition:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge L) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right)$\n\n### 4.

To observe at least 30% of the decays, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution, $L_{res}$.\n    $P(x \\ge L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the maximum possible resolution that satisfies this, we solve the equality:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right) \\approx \\lambda \\times 1.204$\n    $L_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.269 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    The code execution provided a more precise value:\n    $L_{res} = 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculation shows that the detector resolution must be less than or equal to $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m to observe at least 30% of the decays. We now compare this result to the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOption A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the only one with the correct order of magnitude. It is also a valid resolution, as it is less than the calculated maximum of $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. A detector with this resolution would successfully observe more than 30% of the decays. The small numerical difference is likely due to rounding of constants in the problem's design.\n\n<<<A>>>"
