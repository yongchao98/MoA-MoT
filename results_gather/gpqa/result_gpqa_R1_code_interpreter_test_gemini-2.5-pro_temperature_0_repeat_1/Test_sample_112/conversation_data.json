    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid (contains both -COOH and C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from all three techniques strongly points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n    *   We are left with C6H12O2 and C6H10O2. To differentiate between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   The functional groups we identified require a certain DoU:\n        *   One C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU.\n        *   One C=C bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU.\n        *   **Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = 2.**\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options.\n\nI will use a Python script to calculate the DoU for all the given formulas to find the one that matches our required DoU of 2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    # DoU = C - H/2 + 1\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Degree of Unsaturation for each formula:\")\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {dou}\")\n\n```\n executing code...\n> **execute_code:**\n> \n> \n> \n> stdout:\n> Degree of Unsaturation for each formula:\n> Option A) C6H12O2: DoU = 1\n> Option B) C6H10O2: DoU = 2\n> Option C) C6H12O: DoU = 1\n> Option D) C6H10O: DoU = 2\n> \n> \n> stderr:\n> \n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The spectroscopic data requires the molecule to be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   This means it must contain **two oxygen atoms** and have a **Degree of Unsaturation of 2**.\n    *   Looking at the options and the calculated DoU:\n        *   A) C6H12O2: Has 2 oxygens, but DoU = 1. Incorrect.\n        *   B) C6H10O2: Has 2 oxygens and DoU = 2. **Correct.**\n        *   C) C6H12O: Has only 1 oxygen. Incorrect.\n        *   D) C6H10O: Has only 1 oxygen. Incorrect.\n\n    The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the analysis of the spectroscopic data and the calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), we can draw a definitive conclusion.\n\n1.  **Spectroscopic Evidence Summary:**\n    *   **FTIR & Mass Spec:** The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the mass fragment at m/z = 45 all strongly indicate the presence of a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**. This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **FTIR & ¹H NMR:** The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the presence of vinyl hydrogens confirm the existence of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Requirement:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   An alkene contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for another **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   We must select a formula that has **two oxygen atoms** and a **DoU of 2**.\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** Has two oxygens, but the code output shows its DoU is 1. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** Has two oxygens, and the code output shows its DoU is 2. This matches all the evidence.\n    *   **C) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen. This is incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the experimental requirements is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
