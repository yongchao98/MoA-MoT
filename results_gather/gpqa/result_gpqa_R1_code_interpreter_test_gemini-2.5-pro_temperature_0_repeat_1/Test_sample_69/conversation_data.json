    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 4**\n*   **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A very common reaction between two gases that forms a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n*   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) -> COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n*   Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 3**\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n*   If B is Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   HCl is a strong acid, so we can identify **F = HCl**.\n*   The reaction also regenerates the solid starting material A and produces a weak acid G. This suggests that the hydrolysis is a disproportionation reaction, where the central element in C is both reduced (back to A) and oxidized (to form the weak oxyacid G).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (gas) -> C (bright red product).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we have: A (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) -> C (bright red).\n*   The 1:8 molar ratio is a very strong clue. Let's consider elements that exist as stable polyatomic molecules in their solid state. Sulfur is a prime candidate, with its most stable allotrope being rhombic sulfur, S₈.\n*   Let's test the reaction with **A = S₈**.\n*   S₈ (s) + 8 Cl₂ (g) -> 8 SCl₂\n*   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and fits the \"1 to 8 equivalents\" description perfectly.\n*   Now let's check the product C. **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities with Reaction 3 again**\n*   Let's check if the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂ matches the products.\n*   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is complex but is known to disproportionate. A representative equation is:\n    3 SCl₂ + 4 H₂O -> 2 S + H₂SO₃ + 6 HCl\n*   Let's check the products against our deductions:\n    *   **A = S** (elemental sulfur), which is a solid. This matches the regeneration of A (S₈ is just the allotrope).\n    *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), a strong acid. This matches.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid. This matches.\n*   All compounds identified so far (A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=CO, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=COCl₂) are consistent with the first three reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify E**\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product).\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: SCl₂ + 2 CO -> E.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two products: phosgene (COCl₂) and carbonyl sulfide (SCO).\n    SCl₂ + 2 CO -> COCl₂ + SCO\n*   The problem states this reaction produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\" and asks for its molecular symmetry group, implying E is a single molecular species. Phosgene (COCl₂) is well-known for being an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is toxic, but phosgene better fits the description. Furthermore, we need to find the symmetry group of E from the given options.\n*   Let's assume **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   Molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Its structure is trigonal planar, with the carbon atom at the center, double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    2.  A vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n    3.  A second vertical mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first plane and also contains the C₂ axis (bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with an identity element (E), one C₂ axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check on the other product: Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is a linear molecule (O=C=S). It has a C∞ axis but no center of inversion or horizontal mirror plane, so its point group is C∞v, which is not among the options. This reinforces the conclusion that E is phosgene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
