    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude:** The Doppler shift formula is $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_{r,star} / c$, where $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_{r,star}$ is the star's radial velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light. The problem gives the periodic shift amplitude, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K_{star}$.\n    Therefore, $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:** We are given the wavelength shift amplitudes for the two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n4.  **Relate RV Amplitude to Orbital Parameters:** The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K_{star} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Relationship for this Specific Problem:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   Since no information is given about the orbital inclinations, we assume they are similar ($i_1 \\approx i_2$), which is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\n    With these conditions, the terms involving masses and inclination are constant for both systems. The relationship between $K_{star}$ and $T$ simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can write the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find $T_2 / T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} \\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} \\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Result:**\n    We know that $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# T2/T1 = (K1/K2)^3 = ( (delta_lambda_1) / (delta_lambda_2) )^3\nratio_of_periods = (5 / 7)**3\nprint(ratio_of_periods)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
