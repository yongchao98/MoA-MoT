    "This is a common phrase used by chemists, particularly those who use chromatography for purification and analysis. Let's break down why.\n\n1.  **Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A primary activity in such a lab is synthesizing a target molecule. After a reaction, the resulting mixture often contains the desired product, unreacted starting materials, and various byproducts. A crucial step is to separate and purify the desired product from this mixture.\n\n2.  **Separation Technique:** The most common technique for separating compounds in an organic chemistry lab is **chromatography**, especially Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and Column Chromatography for large-scale purification.\n\n3.  **How Chromatography Works:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (often polar, like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents, called the eluent).\n    *   **Polarity is Key:** In normal-phase chromatography (the most common type), the stationary phase is polar (silica gel or alumina). Polar compounds will \"stick\" more strongly to the polar stationary phase and move more slowly. Non-polar compounds will be more soluble in the less-polar mobile phase and will move more quickly.\n    *   **Visualization:** On a TLC plate, after running the chromatogram and visualizing the compounds (e.g., with a UV lamp), each compound appears as a \"spot.\" The distance a spot travels up the plate is called its Rf value. In column chromatography, the compounds elute from the bottom of the column at different times, and are collected in separate fractions.\n\n4.  **\"On Top of Each Other\":** This phrase is a direct visual description of what happens on a TLC plate when two compounds have very similar polarities. Because they have similar polarities, they interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way. As a result, they travel up the TLC plate at the same rate, and their spots end up at the same height, appearing as a single, overlapping spotâ€”literally \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that separating them using column chromatography will be very difficult or impossible with that particular solvent system.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Similar optical rotations: Optical rotation is a property measured by a polarimeter and relates to a compound's chirality. It is not a separation technique itself, and this phrase doesn't describe a polarimetry measurement.\n    *   B) Bonding through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions: While these interactions are the fundamental reason *why* compounds stick to the stationary phase, the statement is too general. The chemist is describing the *outcome* of a failed separation, not the underlying physics in such a broad sense. The practical reason for the failed separation is that the *net effect* of these interactions is too similar for the different compounds.\n    *   C) Similar polarities: This is the direct cause of the failed chromatographic separation. If the polarities are too similar, the compounds will have nearly identical Rf values on a TLC plate, causing their spots to be \"on top of each other.\" This is the most accurate and direct interpretation of the chemist's statement.\n    *   D) Similar boiling points: This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. The jargon for a failed distillation is different (e.g., \"they co-distill\" or \"it's an azeotrope\"). The phrase \"on top of each other\" is strongly associated with chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is lamenting that their compounds are not separating during chromatography because their polarities are too similar.\n\n<<<C>>>"
