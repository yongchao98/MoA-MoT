    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This means:\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1: $l_1 = 1$.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2: $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system: $l = 2$.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum: $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    We are measuring the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$. For simplicity, we can denote this state as $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|-1, -1>$ when it is initially in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The corresponding quantum numbers are related by:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Check if this condition is satisfied.**\n    *   For the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final measured state $|-1, -1>$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We see that the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n\n6.  **Draw the conclusion.**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$. This is known as the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l} |m_1, m_2>$\n    A crucial rule for this expansion is that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l}$ are zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n    In our case, the inner product $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>$ is precisely the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{-1, -1, -1}^{1, 1, 2}$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, this coefficient is zero.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the concept of orthogonality of eigenstates.\n    *   The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|-1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar \\neq -2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, their inner product is zero: $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1> = 0$.\n\n    The probability is the square of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
