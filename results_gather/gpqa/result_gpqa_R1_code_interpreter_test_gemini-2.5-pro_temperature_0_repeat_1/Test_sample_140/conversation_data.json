    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via a benzyne mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n2.  **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, a base will abstract a proton (H+) more readily and quickly than a deuteron (D+). However, both abstractions are possible. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than H+ abstraction.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    4.  The deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The incoming NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the NH2 group at C1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation results in the same product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, even those formed via a minor pathway. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
