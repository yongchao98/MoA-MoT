    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamic Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core concept:** The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant because the reduction reaction is more spontaneous (more negative Gibbs free energy, ΔG° = -nFE°).\n\n2.  **Find the relevant half-reactions and their potentials:** We need to compare the reduction of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l). The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq). The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\n3.  **Compare the potentials:** We compare the E° value in a basic solution to the E° value in an acidic solution.\n    *   E°(basic) = +0.40 V\n    *   E°(acidic) = +1.23 V\n    *   Since +0.40 V is less than +1.23 V, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\n4.  **Fill in the first blank:** The statement \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions\" should be filled with **weaker**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetic Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core concept:** Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction, which is primarily determined by the activation energy (Ea). A high activation energy leads to a slow reaction rate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the oxygen reduction reaction:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) involves breaking the very strong O=O double bond. The bond dissociation energy is high (approximately 498 kJ/mol).\n\n3.  **Determine the reaction rate:** Breaking this strong bond requires a significant amount of energy, resulting in a high activation energy for the overall reaction. Reactions with high activation energies are kinetically slow. This is a well-known characteristic of oxygen, often referred to as its \"kinetic inertness.\" This is why many thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions (like the rusting of iron or the combustion of fuel) are very slow or do not occur at room temperature without a catalyst or an initial input of energy (like a spark). The statement is about the reaction in acidic solution, but this kinetic slowness is a general feature of oxygen reduction.\n\n4.  **Fill in the second blank:** The statement \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions\" should be filled with **slower**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   From the thermodynamic analysis, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   From the kinetic analysis, oxygen reacts **slower**.\n\nCombining these two findings, the correct pair is **weaker - slower**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
