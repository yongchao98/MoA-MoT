    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The limits of integration also change:\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n\n    Now substitute into the integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] u^-2 du`\n    The integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ (lim u→∞ 1/u) - (1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
