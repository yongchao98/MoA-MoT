    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), with an (S) configuration. This chiral center is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same ((S) at C5) and the other is different ((R) vs (S) at C3), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. A chiral molecule with an internal plane of symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (rotating the molecule 180° in the plane of the paper shows they are the same).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n*   **Relationship:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and their diastereomer (the meso compound). In total, there are three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all five products from both reactions:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves will not separate and will elute as one peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and structures. They will have significantly different retention times and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
