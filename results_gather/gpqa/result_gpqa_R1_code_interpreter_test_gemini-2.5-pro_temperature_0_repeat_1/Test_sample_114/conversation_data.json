    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThis problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation process. The key principles to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system before the collision must equal the total momentum vector after the collision.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** Since the particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Define the Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\nLet's set the direction of the electron's motion as the positive x-axis. We can set the rest mass of the electron `m_e` and the speed of light `c` to 1 for simplicity, as they will cancel out in the final calculation of the angle.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Total energy, `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4` (in units of `m_e*c^2`).\n    *   Momentum, `p_e`. The formula relating energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n    *   `p_e*c = sqrt(E_e^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(4^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(15)`.\n    *   So, `p_e = sqrt(15)` (in units of `m_e*c`).\n    *   Momentum vector: `p_vec_e = (sqrt(15), 0)`.\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   It moves from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction.\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Total energy, `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_p*c = sqrt(E_p^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(2^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(3)`.\n    *   So, `p_p = sqrt(3)`.\n    *   Momentum vector: `p_vec_p = (-sqrt(3), 0)`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    *   `E_i = E_e + E_p = 4 + 2 = 6`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (p_i):**\n    *   `p_i_x = p_e_x + p_p_x = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)`.\n    *   `p_i_y = 0`.\n    *   Total initial momentum vector: `p_vec_i = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3), 0)`.\n\n**4. Define the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons (γ1 and γ2).\n\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the photons have equal energy, let's call it `E_γ`.\n    *   From energy conservation: `E_i = E_f`.\n    *   `6 = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n    *   Therefore, `E_γ = 3`.\n*   **Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`.\n    *   The magnitude of the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3`.\n\n*   **Direction:**\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\", and the other \"lower-right\". Let the angle of the first photon with the x-axis be `θ`, and the second be `-φ`.\n    *   From momentum conservation in the y-direction: `p_i_y = p_f_y`.\n    *   `0 = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-φ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(φ)`.\n    *   This implies `sin(θ) = sin(φ)`. Since the photons are moving in different directions, we must have `θ = φ`. So the angles are `θ` and `-θ`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we use momentum conservation in the x-direction.\n\n*   `p_i_x = p_f_x`\n*   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ)`\n*   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3`:\n*   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 2 * 3 * cos(θ) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\nSo, we need to calculate `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value inside the arccos function\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThis problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation. The core principles we need to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1), we must use the formulas of special relativity.\n\n**2. Define the Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\nLet's set the horizontal axis as the x-axis, with the electron moving in the positive direction. We will use a system of units where the rest mass of the electron (`m_e`) and the speed of light (`c`) are both equal to 1. This simplifies the calculations, as these constants will cancel out in the final result for the angle.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   It moves from left to right (+x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Relativistic energy is given by `E = γmc²`. In our units, `E_e = 4 * 1 * 1² = 4`.\n    *   The energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    *   Solving for momentum `p`: `(p_e c)² = E_e² - (m_e c²)²`.\n    *   In our units: `p_e² = E_e² - m_e² = 4² - 1² = 16 - 1 = 15`.\n    *   So, the momentum of the electron is `p_e = sqrt(15)`.\n    *   The momentum vector of the electron is `p_vec_e = (sqrt(15), 0)`.\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   It moves from right to left (-x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Energy: `E_p = γ_p m_e c² = 2 * 1 * 1² = 2`.\n    *   Momentum: `p_p² = E_p² - m_e² = 2² - 1² = 4 - 1 = 3`.\n    *   So, the momentum of the positron is `p_p = sqrt(3)`.\n    *   Since it moves in the negative x-direction, its momentum vector is `p_vec_p = (-sqrt(3), 0)`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    *   `E_i = E_e + E_p = 4 + 2 = 6`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (p_i):**\n    *   The total momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta.\n    *   x-component: `p_i_x = p_e_x + p_p_x = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)`.\n    *   y-component: `p_i_y = 0`.\n    *   Total initial momentum vector: `p_vec_i = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3), 0)`.\n\n**4. Define the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Energy:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of energy, `E_final = E_initial = 6`.\n    *   The problem states the two photons have the same energy. Let's call this `E_γ`.\n    *   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n    *   Therefore, `2 * E_γ = 6`, which means `E_γ = 3` for each photon.\n\n*   **Momentum:**\n    *   For a photon, the energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. In our units where `c=1`, this means `p = E`.\n    *   So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = 3`.\n\n*   **Direction:**\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This means they move at angles `θ` and `-θ` with respect to the horizontal (x-axis).\n    *   Let's check the conservation of momentum in the y-direction:\n        *   `p_f_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0`.\n        *   This matches the initial y-momentum `p_i_y = 0`, so our assumption of symmetric angles `θ` and `-θ` is correct.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle using Momentum Conservation**\n\nNow we apply the conservation of momentum in the x-direction.\n\n*   `p_i_x = p_f_x`\n*   `p_f_x` is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta: `p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n*   Setting initial and final x-momenta equal:\n    `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value we found for `p_γ = 3`:\n    `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 2 * 3 * cos(θ) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. This angle is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`. To find this, we first find `θ` and then double it.\n\n`θ = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 )`\nTotal Angle = `2 * arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 )`\n\nLet's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta.
