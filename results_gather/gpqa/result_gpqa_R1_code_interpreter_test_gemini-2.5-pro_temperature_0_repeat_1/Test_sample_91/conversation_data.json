    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's break down the structure to count the atoms and bonds.\n\n*   **Structure Analysis:**\n    *   The main carbon chain is `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. This is a 7-carbon chain.\n    *   The first carbon has two methyl `(CH3)` groups attached: `(CH3)2C=`.\n    *   The fourth carbon has one methyl `(CH3)` group attached: `-CH(CH3)-`.\n    *   The seventh carbon has two methyl `(CH3)` groups attached: `=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 7 carbons in the main chain + 2 from the first `(CH3)2` + 1 from the `CH(CH3)` + 2 from the second `(CH3)2` = 7 + 5 = 12 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   `(CH3)2C=`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n        *   `=CH-`: 1 H\n        *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n        *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n        *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n        *   `-CH=`: 1 H\n        *   `=C(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n        *   Total H = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure (`C=C`). So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:**\n        *   In the main chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are 4 single bonds between the carbons of the chain.\n        *   Bonds to methyl groups: There are 5 methyl groups attached to the main chain. So, **5 C-C bonds** connecting the branches.\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22 C-H bonds**.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom(compound))**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atom(compound) = Σ (Bond energies of all bonds)\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H × BE(C-H))\n\nGiven values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nCalculation:\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atom(compound) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **3.

Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f(compound))**\n\nWe use Hess's Law. The formation of the compound can be seen as:\n1.  Elements (standard state) → Gaseous atoms (ΔH = ΔH_f(atoms))\n2.  Gaseous atoms → Compound(g) (ΔH = -ΔH_atom(compound))\n\nΔH_f(compound) = ΔH_f(atoms) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔH_f(compound) = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(compound) = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5.
