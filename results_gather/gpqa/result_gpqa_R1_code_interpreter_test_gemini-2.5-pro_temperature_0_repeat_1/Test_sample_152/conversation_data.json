    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic α-protons (pKa ≈ 13) on the carbon between the two ester groups. The strong base, NaOEt, deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`, is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electron-deficient due to conjugation with the ester group, making it the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Protonation:** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃` + `EtOH` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + `EtO⁻`\n\n4.  **Product A Structure and Name:** The product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`. Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The names use a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" system. Let's map our product to this system by considering the three-carbon chain connecting the key groups: `C(from malonate) - C(β from acrylate) - C(α from acrylate)`.\n    *   Carbon 1 (from malonate) has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n    *   Carbon 2 (β-carbon) has the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   Carbon 3 (α-carbon) is part of a `-CH₂-COOCH₃` group.\n    This connectivity matches the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. The alternative name, `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`, implies a different connectivity where the p-tolyl group is on a terminal carbon, which is incorrect.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (which involves a Michael addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon of the parent carbonyl (the β-carbon of the enamine double bond).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized anion. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two effects: it protonates the anion and hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n\n4.  **Product B Structure and Name:** The reaction forms a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting side chain attached to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. The IUPAC name for this molecule is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol form, which is generally less stable and not the major product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** Reactant C and but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`. After the Michael addition, the MVK moiety becomes the `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`) attached to the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The product shows that the `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. The C2 position of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is highly acidic. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as the Michael donor. Therefore, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not a stable chemical structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n*   B) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   D) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly identifies all three components.\n\n<<<A>>>"
