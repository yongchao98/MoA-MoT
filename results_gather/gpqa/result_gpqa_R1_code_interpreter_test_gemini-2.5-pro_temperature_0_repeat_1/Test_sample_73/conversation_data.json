    "This is a classic problem involving the principles of radioactive decay, which is governed by an exponential distribution. The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Model:** Radioactive decay is a random process. The probability of a single unstable nucleus decaying in a given time interval is constant and independent of how long the nucleus has already existed. This is known as the memoryless property. The time `T` until decay follows an exponential distribution.\n\n2.  **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    *   Let `λ` be the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that the atom survives past time `t` (i.e., does not decay) is given by the survival function: `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`.\n    *   The probability that the atom decays by time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function: `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Subtracting 1 from both sides and multiplying by -1:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the given probability. We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` explicitly, as we can use the value of `e^(-100λ)` directly.\n\n4.  **Formulating the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    Let's denote the event that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes as `A = (T > 50)`.\n    Let's denote the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes as `B = (T ≤ 50 + 150) = (T ≤ 200)`.\n    We are looking for the conditional probability `P(B | A) = P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n5.  **Applying the Memoryless Property:**\n    The memoryless property of the exponential distribution states that `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`.\n    In our context, this means the probability of surviving for an additional `s` minutes is the same, regardless of how long (`t`) it has already survived. The process effectively \"forgets\" its past.\n    Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in the first 150 minutes.\n    `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    We know from Step 3 that `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    We can manipulate this to find `e^(-150λ)`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-λ))^150`\n    From `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we have `e^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)`.\n    Substituting this in:\n    `e^(-150λ) = ((0.68)^(1/100))^150 = (0.68)^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%.\n# This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# P(T > 100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to\n# finding the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n# P(T <= 150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can write exp(-lambda * 150) as (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100)\n# which is (0.68)^1.5\n\nprob_survival_150_min = (0.68)**1.5\nprob_decay_150_min = 1 - prob_survival_150_min\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150_min * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation `1 - (0.68)^1.5` yields approximately `0.4393`, or `43.93%`. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The decay of a single radioactive atom is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"age\".\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The problem is therefore equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let `λ` be the decay constant of the atom.\n    *   The probability of an atom surviving past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying by time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function `F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `F(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, which is `F(150)`.\n    *   `F(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to the value we found in the previous step, `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Using the properties of exponents: `e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is `F(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The python code calculated this value: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393`.\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option C) 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
