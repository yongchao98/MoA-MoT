    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter one `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can use the given conditions to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`).\n\n1.  Start with the two equations:\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n3.  Now find `m1`:\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n4.  Convert these masses into rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (m2): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n*   `Q = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\n*   `p1_cl = p2_cl = p_cl` (in magnitude)\n*   Classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2` => `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`\n\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    *   `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1 GeV**.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is also conserved (`p1 = p2 = p`). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   We can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since `p` is the same for both fragments, `(p*c)^2` is also the same.\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    *   `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding the terms:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n*   Now, substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out.\n    *   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1.\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Define initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies in GeV\n# m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M\n# This gives m1 = 0.66*M and m2 = 0.33*M\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\nQ_GeV = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q and T1_cl/T2_cl = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q => 3*T1_cl = Q\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we derive:\n# T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*m2*c^2) / (2 * M*c^2)\nT1_relativistic_GeV = (Q_GeV**2 + 2 * Q_GeV * m2_c2) / (2 * M_c2)\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV}\")\n```\n\n5.0\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1 is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Define the System and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass `M`.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter one `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2`\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1_cl = p2_cl`).\n\n*   The kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is also conserved (`p1 = p2`). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the equation:\n    `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding the terms (`(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999893` is a result of floating-point precision in computation, which is effectively 5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
