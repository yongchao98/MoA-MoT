    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a *syn*-addition. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is also achiral, the reaction must produce either an achiral product or a racemic mixture. The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral. Therefore, a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons, leading to the formation of a diol. This ring-opening occurs via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   The overall transformation from alkene to diol (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the substituents are the same, which they are here: propyl groups).\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. These are the same meso compound.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Again, this is the same meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene forms a cis-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is the *anti*-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry:\n        *   Opening of the meso-epoxide (e.g., (4R,5S)-epoxide): Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the starting material (meso-epoxide) is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions:\n*   From Reaction 1: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-diol)\n*   From Reaction 2: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a racemic pair)\n\nIn total, there are three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (R,R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (S,S)-diol.\n*   The (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore have the same retention time, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair ((R,R)-diol + (S,S)-diol) will appear as **one peak**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will have a different retention time and appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks in standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Therefore, the enantiomers (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will also be separated, appearing as a **third peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
