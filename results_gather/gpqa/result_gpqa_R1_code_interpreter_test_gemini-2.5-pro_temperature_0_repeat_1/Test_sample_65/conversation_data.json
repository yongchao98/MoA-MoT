    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators built from the SM fields. The construction of SMEFT relies on certain fundamental principles of quantum field theory (QFT). Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. Quantum field theories, including the Standard Model and its effective extensions like SMEFT, are built upon the principle of Lorentz invariance. The Lagrangian of SMEFT, including all higher-dimensional operators, is constructed to be a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry**: This is the full symmetry group of special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption in the construction of SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry through the complex phase in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction. Since the SM Lagrangian, which is the leading-order part of the SMEFT Lagrangian, already violates CP, there is no reason to impose this symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators. In fact, many SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a departure from the fundamental framework of QFT itself.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the fundamental principles of constructing SMEFT:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not required to be respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
