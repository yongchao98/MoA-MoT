    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This suggests a reaction involving elimination and/or rearrangement. The spectral data for the product (Product 1) are key:\n*   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n*   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material (C10H14Br2), indicating the adamantane skeleton is likely intact and the formula is C10H14O.\nThe reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement to form a more strained isomer. The product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The unusual chemical shift at 4.79 ppm in the provided NMR data is likely due to the high strain in this tetracyclic ketone structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\nThe next step in the sequence is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that the alcohol formed, protoadamantan-4-ol, must have been converted to an alkene. Under heating, alcohols can undergo dehydration. Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol forms a double bond between C4 and C5, yielding **protoadamant-4-ene** (Product 2). Elimination towards the C3 bridgehead is disfavored by Bredt's rule.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\nCleavage of the C4=C5 double bond in the C10 tetracyclic protoadamant-4-ene skeleton results in a C10 tricyclic dicarbonyl compound. The carbon atom at position 4 of the double bond becomes a ketone, and the carbon atom at position 5 becomes an aldehyde. The resulting structure is **7-oxobicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde** (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3**\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule containing alkyl protons, protons alpha to a ketone, and an aldehyde proton, the **aldehyde proton (-CHO)** is by far the most deshielded (typically δ 9-10 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine how the signal for this aldehyde proton is split by neighboring protons.\n    1.  **³J Coupling (3-bond coupling):** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. This coupling to one proton (n=1) splits the signal into a **doublet** (n+1 = 2 peaks).\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling:** The answer choices suggest more complex splitting. We must consider coupling over more than three bonds. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework is rigid, allowing for observable long-range couplings. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) chemically equivalent.\n    3.  **⁵J Coupling (5-bond coupling):** There is a viable coupling path over five bonds between the aldehyde proton and the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5). Coupling to these two equivalent protons (n=2) would split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3 peaks).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the C3 proton, and each peak of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent bridgehead protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
