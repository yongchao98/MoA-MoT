    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\nThis molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern (1,3,5) is crucial for determining the correct synthetic route.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group (by induction) but an *ortho, para*-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating, making the Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring fail. The primary reaction would be N-acylation. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.\niv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply converts benzene back to benzene, making the first four steps pointless. The synthesis then restarts from benzene.\nv) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nvi) Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is an *o,p*-director and para is sterically favored).\nvii) 4-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring has a -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and a -COCH3 at C4 (m-director). The -Br directs to C2 and C6. The -COCH3 directs to C3 and C5. The directing effects do not align to produce the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The major product would be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the target molecule.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\niii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2), and Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is correct.\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring now has a -COCH3 group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a -Br group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) much less reactive towards electrophilic attack. The least deactivated position is C5 (meta to the acetyl group). Therefore, nitration will preferentially occur at C5.\n    *   This reaction yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the desired target molecule.\n\nThe synthesis is successfully completed in these first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv to vii) are superfluous for synthesizing the target molecule and are likely an error in the question's formulation. However, since the initial part of sequence C provides a valid and high-yield route to the desired product, and all other options contain fatal flaws, option C is the correct choice.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Start with benzene.\n2.  Introduce a *meta*-director: Acylation to get acetophenone.\n3.  Introduce a second substituent *meta* to the first: Bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n4.  Introduce the third substituent: Nitration. The combined directing effects lead to substitution at C5, resulting in the 1,3,5 pattern. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
