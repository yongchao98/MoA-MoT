    "This problem requires analyzing spectroscopic and chromatographic data to identify the nature of a sample. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate the given options.\n\n**Evidence Summary:**\n\n1.  **Compound:** A chemically synthesized small peptide.\n2.  **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   The two peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n    *   The integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H.\n    *   The splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n3.  **LC-MS:**\n    *   Run at elevated temperature.\n    *   Two clearly defined peaks.\n    *   The peaks have equal intensities.\n    *   Both peaks show the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n\n**Analysis of the Evidence:**\n\n*   The NMR data indicates the presence of two distinct chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since the two peaks correspond to the *same* proton in the peptide's structure, these two species must be very similar, likely isomers. The fact that they have different chemical shifts means they are not enantiomers (which are indistinguishable in a standard achiral NMR solvent).\n*   The LC-MS data confirms the presence of two species in a 1:1 ratio (equal intensities) that are separable by liquid chromatography. The fact that they have the same mass spectrum confirms they are isomers of the expected molecule, ruling out impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular formulas.\n*   The combination of being separable by standard LC and having distinct NMR spectra points strongly towards the two species being **diastereoisomers**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard ¹H NMR spectrum or a standard LC run. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would create a side product with a different chemical structure and a higher molecular weight than the target peptide. The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the expected molecule, ruling this out.\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule, almost certainly with a different molecular weight. Again, this is contradicted by the LC-MS data showing both peaks have the same, correct mass.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and are chemically distinct.\n    *   **NMR:** They will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereoisomers would have different chemical shifts. A 1:1 mixture would show two peaks of equal intensity, as observed.\n    *   **LC:** They can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography, which would result in two distinct peaks, as observed.\n    *   **MS:** As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Origin in Peptides:** This situation is very common in peptide chemistry. It is often caused by slow rotation around an amide bond (especially an X-Proline bond), creating *cis* and *trans* rotamers. These rotamers are diastereomers and interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale at room temperature, giving rise to two sets of signals. Another possibility is epimerization at one of the chiral alpha-carbons during synthesis, which would also create a diastereomer. Both scenarios fit the data perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are distinguishable by NMR and separable by LC can only be explained if they are diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
