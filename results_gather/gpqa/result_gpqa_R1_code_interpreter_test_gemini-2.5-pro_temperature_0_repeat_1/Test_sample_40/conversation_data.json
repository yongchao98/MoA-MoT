    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the laboratory frame, where the observer is stationary.\n    *   Let `S'` be the rest frame of the moving glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame `S'`) relative to the laboratory (frame `S`) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (`S'`), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n    *   The problem states `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We need to find `u`, the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame `S`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities in a relativistic context. The formula for adding two velocities, `u'` and `v`, that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
