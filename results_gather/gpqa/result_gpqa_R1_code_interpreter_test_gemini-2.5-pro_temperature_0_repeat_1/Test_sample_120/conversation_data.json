    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused to a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` indicates that the bridging atom of the cyclopropane (atom 7) is an oxygen, meaning this is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The reactive species is the nucleophilic methyl group (effectively \"Me⁻\").\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\n\n*   A key rule for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring. This is a characteristic of soft nucleophiles in Sₙ2-type reactions.\n*   Let's examine the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 and C6:\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, and is also bonded to C2 and C6 within the ring. It is a **quaternary** carbon (tetrasubstituted).\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, and is bonded to C1 and C5. It is a **tertiary** carbon (trisubstituted).\n*   Comparing the two, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n*   The attack at C6 will break the C6-O bond, and the oxygen atom (which remains attached to C1) will become a hydroxyl group (-OH) after acidic workup.\n*   The product will have the hydroxyl group at C1 and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   Let's consider the naming of the product. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is given the lowest possible number, so it will be C1. The original C6, now bearing a new methyl group, will become C2. The product will be a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion immediately eliminates options C and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. These would arise from an attack at C1, which is the more hindered site and thus disfavored.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\n*   The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n*   Let's trace the stereochemistry of each chiral center from the starting material to the product.\n\n    *   **Starting Material Structure:** From the name (1R,3R,4R,6S), we can deduce the 3D structure. The cis-fusion of the epoxide is standard. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing 'up' (beta face).\n        *   To have **1R**, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha).\n        *   To have **6S**, the hydrogen at C6 must be 'up' (beta).\n        *   The methyl groups at C3 (R) and C4 (R) will occupy specific positions, which we can assume to be equatorial and 'down' (alpha) in the most stable conformation.\n\n    *   **The Attack:** The C6-O bond is 'up' (beta). The Sₙ2 attack requires the nucleophile (Me⁻) to approach from the opposite face. Therefore, the methyl group attacks C6 from the **'down' (alpha) side**.\n\n    *   **Stereocenters in the Product:**\n        *   **C1:** The configuration at C1 is not affected by the reaction. It was **R** in the starting material, so it remains **R** in the product. The product has a (1R,...) configuration.\n        *   **C4 and C5 (new numbering):** These carbons correspond to C4 and C3 in the starting material, respectively. Their configurations are also unaffected. They were both R. So, the product is (..., 4R, 5R).\n        *   **C2 (new numbering, from original C6):** This is the center where the reaction occurs. The configuration inverts. However, we must be careful. The simple label \"S\" inverting to \"R\" is only guaranteed if the priority ranking of the other three groups does not change. Here, the departing group is -O- (part of the epoxide), and the incoming group is -CH₃. The priorities of the substituents at this carbon change significantly. We must determine the final configuration from the geometry of the product.\n            *   At the original C6, the H atom was 'up' (beta). It remains 'up'.\n            *   The new methyl group adds from the 'down' (alpha) side.\n            *   So, at the new C2, we have an H atom 'up' (beta) and a methyl group 'down' (alpha).\n            *   Let's assign the configuration using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for the new C2. The substituents are C1 (bearing an OH), C3 (a CH₂ group), a methyl group, and H.\n            *   The priority order is: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n            *   To determine the configuration, we can visualize the most stable chair conformation of the product. In this conformation, the H at C2 is axial ('up') and the Me is equatorial ('down').\n            *   Looking down the C2-H bond (priority 4, pointing towards the viewer), the sequence of the other three groups C1 -> C3 -> Me is clockwise.\n            *   According to the CIP rule, if the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, the assigned configuration is the reverse of what is observed.\n            *   Therefore, Clockwise (R) is reversed to **S**. The configuration at C2 is **S**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\n*   Combining the configurations of all chiral centers in the product, we get: **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
