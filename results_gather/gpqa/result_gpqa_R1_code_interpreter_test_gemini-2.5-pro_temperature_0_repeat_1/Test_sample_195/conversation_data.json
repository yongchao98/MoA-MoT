    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Principle of Conservation of Energy.**\n    In this problem, the force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. This is a conservative force, which means we can define a potential energy $U(x)$. The work done by this force is independent of the path, and the total energy of the system is conserved.\n\n2.  **Define the Total Energy of the System.**\n    The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the relativistic oscillator system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n    *   The relativistic energy of the particle of mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This energy includes the kinetic energy $K=(\\gamma-1)mc^2$ and the rest energy $E_0=mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy of the spring is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, derived from the force $F=-kx$ (by setting $U(0)=0$).\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy at Two Key Points.**\n    The total energy must be the same at all points in the oscillation. We will evaluate the total energy at the point of maximum displacement (the turning point) and at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the turning point (maximum amplitude):**\n        The position is $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position:**\n        The position is $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy (and thus speed) is at its maximum. Let the maximum speed be $v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the turning point is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Let's rearrange this equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}}$\n    $1 - v_{max}^2/c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2/c^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option D.\n\n    *   Option A is physically incorrect as it could lead to $v_{max} > c$.\n    *   Option B is the non-relativistic (classical) limit.\n    *   Option C is dimensionally inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
