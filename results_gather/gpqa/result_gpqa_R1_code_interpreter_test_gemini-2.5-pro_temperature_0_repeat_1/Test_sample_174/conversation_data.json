    "An oscillating charge distribution is the source of electromagnetic radiation. For a source whose size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation, we can use the multipole expansion to describe the radiation field. The leading and typically dominant term in this expansion is the electric dipole radiation.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Source:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, symmetric about the z-axis. The simplest and most dominant mode of oscillation for such a system that produces radiation is an oscillation of charge along the symmetry axis. This creates a time-varying electric dipole moment, **p**(t), oriented along the z-axis. We can write it as **p**(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) **ẑ**, where p₀ is the amplitude of the dipole moment and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n2.  **Angular Distribution of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²c) * sin²(θ)\n    where θ is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\n    The radiated power is proportional to sin²(θ).\n    `f(θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n    The maximum power, A, is radiated when sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    `A = max(dP/dΩ) ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\n    We need to find the fraction of this maximum power radiated at an angle θ = 30°.\n    The power at 30° is:\n    `dP/dΩ (at 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power is the ratio:\n    Fraction = [dP/dΩ (at 30°)] / [max(dP/dΩ)] = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = sin²(30°) / 1\n\n    We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    Therefore, the fraction is (1/2)² = 1/4.\n\n    To confirm this calculation:\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Angle in degrees\n    theta_deg = 30\n    \n    # Convert angle to radians for Python's math functions\n    theta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n    \n    # Calculate sin^2(theta)\n    fraction = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n    \n    print(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n    print(\"As a fraction, this is 1/4.\")\n    ```\n    \n    \n3.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    From the formula for dP/dΩ, we can see the dependence on the angular frequency ω:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the speed of light, c:\n    `ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, where ν is the frequency.\n    From these, we can express ω in terms of λ:\n    `ν = c/λ` => `ω = 2πc/λ`\n\n    So, ω is inversely proportional to λ (`ω ∝ 1/λ`).\n    Substituting this into the power dependence:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    Therefore, a possible form for the function f, which describes the radiated power per unit solid angle, has a wavelength dependence of λ⁻⁴. This is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering's λ⁻⁴ dependence (which is why the sky is blue).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the two results:\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n    *   The radiated power is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\n    This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
