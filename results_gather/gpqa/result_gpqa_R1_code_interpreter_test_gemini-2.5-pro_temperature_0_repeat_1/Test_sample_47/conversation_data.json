    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-haloketone).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** An α-haloketone with an enolizable proton on the other side of the carbonyl group, when treated with a strong base, undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon not bearing the halogen (C6).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks the carbon with the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n    *   The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the resulting intermediate collapses by breaking the bond between C1 and C6, leading to a ring contraction.\n    *   After protonation (e.g., during workup), the final product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent. It is bulky and less reactive than LiAlH₄, which allows it to selectively reduce an acid chloride to an aldehyde without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds) and the C1 carbon of the ring to which it is attached. This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and has no equivalent protons in the molecule. (1 type)\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This is the hydrogen on the ring carbon (C1) that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The Methylene Protons on C2 and C5:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5.\n    *   However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center (within a single molecule of the racemic mixture). One proton is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and the other is \"trans\". These have different chemical environments.\n    *   The \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5. The \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5.\n    *   Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **The Methylene Protons on C3 and C4:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C3 is equivalent to carbon C4.\n    *   Similar to the protons on C2/C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic.\n    *   The \"cis\" proton on C3 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C4. The \"trans\" proton on C3 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C4.\n    *   Therefore, these four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the different types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (methine H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
