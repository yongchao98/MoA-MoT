    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Key Features:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. Since it's di-substituted, the benzene ring itself has the formula -C6H4-.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR data:**\n        *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms.\n    *   The only common functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**. It has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring (-C6H4-).\n    *   The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   The resulting molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n4.  **Determine the Substitution Pattern (ortho, meta, or para):**\n    *   We need to look at the patterns in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the provided 1H NMR options.\n    *   Options A and C show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (e.g., `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`).\n    *   This `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each set is split into a doublet by its neighbor.\n    *   Ortho or meta substitution would result in more complex splitting patterns (typically four distinct signals).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n    X - (C6H4) - C - CH3\n    (at position 1) (at position 4)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for 4-Haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring):** There are 4 such protons. As established, they will appear as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be shifted downfield (higher ppm value). The protons ortho to the halogen will be at a slightly lower ppm value. We expect signals in the range of 7.4-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (on the -COCH3 group):** There are 3 protons in the methyl group. They are adjacent to a carbonyl group and have no neighboring protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.3-2.7 ppm.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction:**\n\n    *   **Prediction Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic region: `~7.4-8.0 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.4-8.0 ppm (2H, d)`\n        *   Aliphatic region: `~2.3-2.7 ppm (3H, s)`\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the predicted pattern and chemical shift range for the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of a methyl ketone.\n        *   **This option is an excellent match.**\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are too low for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton, not a ketone. Our structure is a ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option does not show the characteristic pattern of a di-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are also inconsistent with the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis, the only 1H NMR data that corresponds to the described compound (a 4-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
