    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4 and T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3.\n    *   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 = 1.15 and M2 / M3 = 1.35.\n    *   Albedo (A) is constant for all planets (A = 0.3).\n    *   The planets are in circular orbits around the same star.\n\n3.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except `a` are constant for this system. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\n    This means that for any two planets `i` and `j` in the system:\n    T_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)\n    Squaring both sides gives the relationship for the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2 = a_j / a_i\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Distances:**\n    *   Using the ratio for Planet1 and Planet2:\n        a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n    *   Using the ratio for Planet2 and Planet3:\n        a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\n5.  **Calculate the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio (a3 / a1):**\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a):\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    For any two planets `i` and `j` orbiting the same star, the ratio of their periods is:\n    (P_j / P_i)^2 = (a_j / a_i)^3\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio (P3 / P1):**\n    Now, we can substitute the value of `a3 / a1` we found in step 5 into this equation:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The information about the masses and the specific value of the albedo are not needed for this calculation, as they are either irrelevant (masses, assuming they are much smaller than the star's mass) or cancel out (albedo, since it's the same for all planets). The calculation is performed using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT1_over_T2 = 1.4\nT2_over_T3 = 2.3\n\n# From the equilibrium temperature formula, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n# This leads to the relationship: a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)^2.\na2_over_a1 = T1_over_T2**2\na3_over_a2 = T2_over_T3**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet3 to Planet1.\na3_over_a1 = a3_over_a2 * a2_over_a1\n\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P^2 is proportional to a^3.\n# This leads to the relationship: P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).\nP3_over_P1 = a3_over_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(f\"The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is: {P3_over_P1}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n<<<\n>>>The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is: 33.38680155031602\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.39 times larger than that of Planet1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4 and T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3.\n    *   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 = 1.15 and M2 / M3 = 1.35. (This information is irrelevant for this problem, as Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting a much more massive star does not depend on the planets' masses).\n    *   Albedo (A) is constant for all three planets (A = 0.3).\n    *   The planets are in circular orbits around the same star.\n\n3.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms in the equation are constant except for the semi-major axis `a`. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\n    From this proportionality, we can write the ratio of temperatures for any two planets `i` and `j` as:\n    T_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)\n    Squaring both sides gives us the relationship for the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Distances:**\n    *   For Planet1 and Planet2:\n        a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n    *   For Planet2 and Planet3:\n        a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\n5.  **Calculate the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio (a3 / a1):**\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we can multiply the intermediate ratios:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    For any two planets `i` and `j` orbiting the same star, the ratio of their periods is:\n    (P_j / P_i)^2 = (a_j / a_i)^3\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio (P3 / P1):**\n    Now, we substitute the value of `a3 / a1` that we calculated in step 5 into this equation:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The calculation was performed using the provided Python script.\n    `P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.386`\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately 33.4.
