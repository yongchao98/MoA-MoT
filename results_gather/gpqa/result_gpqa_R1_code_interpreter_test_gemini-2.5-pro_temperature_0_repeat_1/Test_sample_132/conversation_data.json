    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely in water to give 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water.\n    *   The key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This means the solution is a buffer.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant chemical equilibria.**\n    *   The phosphoric acid (H3PO4) system has three dissociation steps with three corresponding acid dissociation constants (Ka):\n        1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n        2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n        3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n    *   Since our solution is a buffer made of H2PO4- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base), the primary equilibrium that determines the pH of the solution is the second one, governed by Ka2.\n    *   The species we want to find the concentration of is the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-. This ion is produced in the third equilibrium, governed by Ka3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   First, calculate the number of moles of each substance.\n        *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Next, calculate the molar concentrations, using the solution volume (200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L).\n        *   [H2PO4-] = (moles of KH2PO4) / 0.200 L\n        *   [HPO4^2-] = (moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O) / 0.200 L\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The equilibrium expression for the buffer system is:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   We can use the initial concentrations calculated in the previous step. The assumption that these concentrations don't change significantly is valid for a buffer.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    *   The equilibrium expression for the formation of PO4^3- is:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   We use the value of Ka3, the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-], and the [H+] calculated in the previous step. The assumption that [HPO4^2-] is equal to its initial concentration is valid because Ka3 is extremely small, meaning very little HPO4^2- will dissociate further.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform these calculations using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration.\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System:**\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\nThe key species, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, form a conjugate acid-base pair, creating a buffer solution.\n\n**2.
