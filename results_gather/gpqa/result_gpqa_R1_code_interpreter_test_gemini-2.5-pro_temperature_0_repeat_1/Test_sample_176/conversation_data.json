    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, `L_1 / L_2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** For a star radiating as a black body, its luminosity (L) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = A * σ * T^4 = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`\n    where `R` is the star's radius, `T` is its surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 as:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\n    The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: `R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`, so `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`.\n    *   Substituting this into the ratio equation:\n        `L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n    *   The information about the mass (`M_1 = 1.5 * M_2`) is not directly needed for this calculation, as the luminosity of a black body is determined by its surface area and temperature, not its mass.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T_1 / T_2):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a black body's temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_max`):\n        `T = b / λ_max_rest`\n        where `b` is Wien's constant and `λ_max_rest` is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n        `T_1 / T_2 = (b / λ_max_rest_1) / (b / λ_max_rest_2) = λ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1`\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2`), but the stars have different radial velocities. We must relate the observed wavelength to the rest wavelength using the Doppler effect formula.\n    *   For Star_1: `v_1 = 0 km/s`. There is no Doppler shift, so `λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_rest_1`.\n    *   For Star_2: `v_2 = 700 km/s`. This star is moving away from us, so its light is redshifted. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:\n        `λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`\n        So, `λ_max_obs_2 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))`.\n    *   Since `λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2`, we have:\n        `λ_max_rest_1 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))`\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio we need for the temperatures:\n        `λ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))`\n\n7.  **Combine the Ratios:**\n    *   Now we can substitute this expression back into the temperature ratio:\n        `T_1 / T_2 = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))`\n    *   And substitute this into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4:\n        `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * [sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))]^4`\n    *   Simplifying the exponent:\n        `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))^2`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, we plug in the numerical values and compute the result.\n    *   `v_2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   The ratio `β = v_2 / c`.\n    *   The final expression is `2.25 * ((1 - β) / (1 + β))^2`.\n\nTo get a precise value, we can use a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants based on the problem statement\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nv2 = 700 * 1000\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n# Ratio of the radii (R1/R2)\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Calculate beta (v2/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio is related to the Doppler shift: T1/T2 = sqrt((1-beta)/(1+beta))\n# Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 = ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.229082903680831\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives a result of approximately 2.229. This value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = A * σ * T^4 = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4\nwhere L is the luminosity, R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, which is L_1 / L_2.\nL_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that R_1 = 1.5 * R_2, so (R_1 / R_2) = 1.5.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures (T_1 / T_2). We can use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_max):\nT = b / λ_max_rest\nwhere b is Wien's constant and λ_max_rest is the peak wavelength in the star's rest frame.\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures is:\nT_1 / T_2 = (b / λ_max_rest_1) / (b / λ_max_rest_2) = λ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2). However, the stars have different radial velocities, so we must account for the Doppler effect to find the rest wavelengths.\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\nwhere v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, v_1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so:\nλ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_rest_1\n\nFor Star_2, v_2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted:\nλ_max_obs_2 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))\n\nSince λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2, we have:\nλ_max_rest_1 = λ_max_rest_2 * sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c))\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\nλ_max_rest_2 / λ_max_rest_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))\n\nThis ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\nT_1 / T_2 = sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))\n\nNow, we substitute this back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * [sqrt((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))]^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c))^2\n\nThe values are:\nv_2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\nc ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nThe calculation from the code gives:\nL_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.22908\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
