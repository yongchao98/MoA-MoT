    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given 1H NMR data.\n\nThe problem provides the 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that the mixture contains two different types of aromatic protons, and both appear as singlets (meaning they have no adjacent proton neighbors).\n    *   The 1:1 ratio means that the total number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies there are only methyl or other alkyl groups that are not coupled to any protons, resulting in singlets.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the mixture is distributed among three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Signal:** 1 singlet, integration 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at C1, C2, C4, and C5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **Signal:** 1 singlet, integration 12H.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible, and they appear as a singlet.\n        *   **Signal:** 1 singlet, integration 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   **Signals:** 3 singlets, with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent and not equivalent. They will couple with each other.\n        *   **Signals:** 2 doublets, integration 1H each.\n    *   **This compound can be eliminated** because the experimental spectrum shows only singlets in the aromatic region.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, like p-xylene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent.\n        *   **Signal:** 1 singlet, integration 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show coupling.\n        *   The CH2 (methylene) protons will be a quartet (split by the CH3).\n        *   The CH3 (methyl) protons will be a triplet (split by the CH2).\n    *   **This compound can be eliminated** because the experimental spectrum shows only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options based on the mixture's spectrum.\n\nFrom Step 2, we have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. This immediately rules out options B, C, and D. The only remaining possibility is option A. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in option A matches the data.\n\n**Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals correspond to 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12H (from durene) + 12H (from isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   The experimental data shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total parts of the ratio are 2+1+1 = 4.\n    *   The integrations of the three signals must be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now let's see if our two compounds can produce this pattern.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n    *   Combining these, we have a pool of signals with integrations {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. To get only three signals in the final spectrum, two of these must overlap (have the same chemical shift).\n    *   By combining the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (an accidental degeneracy), we get a new set of signals: {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n    *   This set of three signals has an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that explains all the features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\n# This code formalizes the analysis performed in the reasoning steps.\n\n# Database of predicted NMR spectra for the candidate compounds\ncompounds = {\n    \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n        \"aromatic\": [{\"integration\": 2, \"type\": \"singlet\"}],\n        \"alkyl\": [{\"integration\": 12, \"type\": \"singlet\"}]\n    },\n    \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n        \"aromatic\": [{\"integration\": 2, \"type\": \"singlet\"}],\n        \"alkyl\": [\n            {\"integration\": 6, \"type\": \"singlet\"},\n            {\"integration\": 3, \"type\": \"singlet\"},\n            {\"integration\": 3, \"type\": \"singlet\"}\n        ]\n    },\n    \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n        \"aromatic\": [{\"integration\": 1, \"type\": \"doublet\"}, {\"integration\": 1, \"type\": \"doublet\"}],\n        \"alkyl\": [{\"integration\": 6, \"type\": \"singlet\"}, {\"integration\": 6, \"type\": \"singlet\"}]\n    },\n    \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n        \"aromatic\": [{\"integration\": 4, \"type\": \"singlet\"}],\n        \"alkyl\": [{\"integration\": 4, \"type\": \"quartet\"}, {\"integration\": 6, \"type\": \"triplet\"}]\n    }\n}\n\n# Options to check\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n    \"B\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n    \"C\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n    \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n}\n\n# --- Analysis ---\n# Expected Aromatic: 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio\n# Expected Alkyl: 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio\n\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option_key, (c1_name, c2_name) in options.items():\n    c1 = compounds[c1_name]\n    c2 = compounds[c2_name]\n\n    # 1.

    "The user's question is to identify which pair of compounds from a given list corresponds to a specific 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these aromatic protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three chemically distinct types of alkyl protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these alkyl protons are on carbons that are not adjacent to carbons with protons (e.g., methyl groups attached to the benzene ring or a quaternary carbon).\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons for these three signals.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (two perpendicular planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent and not equivalent. They would split each other, resulting in **2 doublets**. This does not match the \"two singlets\" observation. **This compound is eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are equivalent, giving **1 singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups would show splitting: a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3. This does not match the \"all singlets\" observation for the alkyl region. **This compound is eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture:**\nWe have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only possible components are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the data.\n\n**Mixture: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-isomer) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1, which has a total of 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n    *   The integration of the signals must be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now, let's see if the compounds can produce this pattern.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three signals of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n    *   For the mixture to show only three signals, some must overlap. If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are accidentally equivalent (have the same chemical shift), they will appear as a single peak with an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  A signal of **12H** (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        2.  A signal of **6H** (from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        3.  A signal of **6H** (from the combined C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
