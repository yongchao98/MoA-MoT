    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the radial distance $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$, and the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The Hamiltonian operator is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n    This can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x_i^2$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the $i$-th dimension.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a $d$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+d-1}{d-1} = \\frac{(n+d-1)!}{n!(d-1)!}$\n\n    For our case, $d=3$ and we are interested in the third excited state, so $n=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0). The permutations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0). The permutations are (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). There is only 1 such state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Each of these 10 states corresponds to a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (i.e., the degeneracy) is 10.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy.\n    B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
