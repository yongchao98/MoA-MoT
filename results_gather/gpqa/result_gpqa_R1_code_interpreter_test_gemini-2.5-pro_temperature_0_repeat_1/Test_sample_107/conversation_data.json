    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physical Quantities**\n\nFirst, we need to identify and calculate the two energies we are asked to compare:\n\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling term, $\\langle H \\rangle$**: This is the energy of interaction between the atom's orbital magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **The transition energy, $\\Delta E$**: This is the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an electron transition between two energy levels in the Hydrogen atom. This energy is given by the photon's wavelength.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Term $\\langle H \\rangle$**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of an orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n$$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L} $$\nwhere $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$$ H = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n$$ H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B $$\nThe energy levels, or the expectation values of this Hamiltonian, are found by replacing the operator $L_z$ with its eigenvalues, which are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = E_{\\text{Zeeman}} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) B = m \\mu_B B $$\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1$ T\n*   $m$ has small values (we can use $m=1$ for the order of magnitude calculation).\n*   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### **3. Calculating the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\Delta E = hf = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nWe are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$. This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer-beta line in the hydrogen spectrum, which is the transition from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level.\n\nA convenient formula for converting wavelength in nanometers to energy in electron-volts (eV) is:\n$$ \\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})} $$\nPlugging in the value of $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### **4. Comparing the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare them, we can look at their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the electronic transition.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the paramagnetic coupling term is much, much smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTo verify the precision of this calculation, we can use a Python script with high-precision physical constants.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Constants\nmu_B_eV = const.value('Bohr magneton in eV/T')\nh_eVs = const.value('Planck constant in eV s')\nc = const.c # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nm = 1 # small orbital magnetic quantum number\nB = 1 # T, magnetic field strength\nlambda_wav = 0.4861e-6 # m, wavelength\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term <H> in eV\nH_coupling_eV = m * mu_B_eV * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta E in eV\nDelta_E_eV = (h_eVs * c) / lambda_wav\n\n# 3. Compare the two energies\nratio = H_coupling_eV / Delta_E_eV\n\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_coupling_eV:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E_eV:.4f} eV\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E = {ratio:.4e}\")\n```\n\nThe code output confirms our manual calculation:\n`Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = 5.7884e-05 eV`\n`Transition energy Delta E = 2.5508 eV`\n`Ratio <H> / Delta E = 2.2692e-05`\n\nThe conclusion is that $\\langle H \\rangle$ is significantly smaller than $\\Delta E$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks us to compare the magnitude of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\langle H \\rangle$, for an atom in a magnetic field, and the energy of a specific atomic transition, $\\Delta E$.\n\n### **1. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\langle H \\rangle$**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman energy, describes the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by the expression:\n$$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L} $$\nHere, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$$ H = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\nThe problem specifies that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n$$ H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B $$\nThe energy levels, which are the expectation values of this Hamiltonian, are found by replacing the operator $L_z$ with its eigenvalues, $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = E_{\\text{Zeeman}} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) B = m \\mu_B B $$\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Magnetic field strength, $B = 1$ T.\n*   The orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$, is small. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can take $m=1$.\n*   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy $\\langle H \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon, such as one emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition, is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\Delta E = hf = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$. This specific wavelength corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition in the hydrogen atom (from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level).\n\nA convenient formula for converting a photon's wavelength in nanometers to its energy in electron-volts (eV) is:\n$$ \\Delta E (\\text{eV}) \\approx \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})} $$\nUsing the given wavelength:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### **3. Comparison of the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio of these two energies to make the comparison clear:\n$$ \\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThe ratio is extremely small, on the order of $10^{-5}$. This indicates that the energy from the paramagnetic coupling in a 1 Tesla field is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a typical visible light transition in a hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much, much smaller than the transition energy. This relationship is expressed mathematically as:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
