    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to form a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻ from NaCN) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Step 1: CH₃COCH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product. The proton source is typically a weak acid or an acidic workup after the initial reaction.\n        *   Step 2: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   The reagent 'A' provides this necessary proton (H⁺). An acidic workup, represented as H₃O⁺, is the standard way to achieve this protonation. Using a strong acid like HCl directly with NaCN is hazardous as it would generate toxic HCN gas. The reaction is usually performed with NaCN, and then H₃O⁺ is added in a separate step. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this eliminates A and C. We are left with options B and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong aqueous acid or a strong aqueous base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong acid like aqueous HCl or H₂SO₄. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong base like aqueous NaOH. This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be acidified in a separate step to yield the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   The reagent 'B' is the catalyst for this hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   Comparing the options for B (HCl vs. CH₃COOH):\n            *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n            *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for 'B' is **HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   We determined that B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
