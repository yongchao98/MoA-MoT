    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\"** This strongly suggests the use of deuterium (D or ²H) in place of hydrogen (H or ¹H), a common practice in chemistry for studying reaction mechanisms.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"**\n        *   Let's examine potential gases (W) where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes, but unlikely product of a violent reaction).\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Yes, very plausible if X contains D).\n            *   CO: 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8 for ¹²C, ¹⁶O). (Yes, plausible).\n            *   N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7 for ¹⁴N). (Yes, plausible).\n        *   The fact that X contains a heavy isotope (from Clue 1) and releases a gas makes D₂ a very strong candidate for W. This implies X contains Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 4, 5, & 6: \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). So, B is D₂O.\n        *   This means the precipitate G is a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. A metal deuteroxide is a perfect candidate, e.g., M(OD)n -> Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n    *   **Synthesizing so far:** Substance X contains Deuterium (D). It reacts with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate (G), which can be heated to form D₂O (B). The most logical liquid Y to provide the extra deuterium for the deuteroxide would be D₂O itself.\n        *   Reaction: X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)\n\n    *   **Clue 7: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   Let's test X = LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n        *   Reaction with Y=D₂O: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas).\n        *   This matches our deductions: W = D₂, G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   Heating G: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases B = D₂O. This also matches.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   The analog of X, LiAlH₄, is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) would be reduced to 2,3-dihydroxypropane (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂OH).\n        *   The product, a diol, contains exactly **two** oxygen atoms. This confirms the chemical nature of X's analog, and thus X itself.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It also specifies, \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for this calculation (Protons + Neutrons).\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of deuterium (¹H) is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n            *   Total mass from the lightest element = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** In LiAlD₄, there is 1 atom of aluminum. The most common isotope of aluminum (²⁷Al) has a mass number of 27.\n            *   Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Check with Code:**\n    The logic can be confirmed with a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# Identify the substance and its components based on the chemical analysis.\n# Substance X = LiAlD4\n# Elements: Li, Al, H (as D)\n\n# Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number.\n# Lightest: Hydrogen (H)\n# Heaviest: Aluminium (Al)\n\n# Get the mass numbers and counts of the atoms for these elements in the molecule.\n# For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D).\nmass_number_D = 2\ncount_D = 4\n\n# For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is 1 atom of Al.\nmass_number_Al = 27\ncount_Al = 1\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from all atoms of the lightest element.\ntotal_mass_lightest = count_D * mass_number_D\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from all atoms of the heaviest element.\ntotal_mass_heaviest = count_Al * mass_number_Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\n>>>35\n\nThe reasoning and calculation both lead to the same result.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X by analyzing the clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" This strongly suggests the presence of Deuterium (D or ²H), the heavy isotope of Hydrogen, which is commonly used in chemical synthesis and for studying reaction mechanisms.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3:** \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's analyze potential gases (W) where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Yes, p=n=2). This is a very strong candidate given Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). (Yes, p=n=14).\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8). (Yes, p=n=14).\n        Given the context of a deuterated compound, D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n    *   **Clue 4, 5, & 6:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   Converting the melting point of B to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K ≈ 3.85 °C.\n        *   This is the well-known melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   This confirms the reaction involves deuterium. If B is D₂O, it implies that the precipitate G is a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. A metal deuteroxide is a perfect candidate (e.g., M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + D₂O).\n        *   The violent reaction producing D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate strongly suggests a reaction between a metal deuteride and heavy water (D₂O). So, liquid Y is likely D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 7:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent known for its violent reaction with water. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Let's test the reaction: X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O.\n        *   `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas)`\n        *   This reaction produces gas W = D₂ and precipitate G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O. All conditions are met.\n    *   **Clue 8:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   The analog of X, LiAlH₄, is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (>CHOH) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which contains exactly **two** oxygen atoms. This confirms the chemical nature of X.\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently identify Substance X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem states to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these elements. We will use integer mass numbers (protons + neutrons).\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, there are 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Hydrogen isotopes = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The most common isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple script can be used.\n```python\n# Substance X is identified as LiAlD4.\n# The elements are Li, Al, and H (as Deuterium, D).\n\n# Lightest element is Hydrogen. It is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D).\n# Mass number of D is 2.\nmass_of_lightest_element_atoms = 4 * 2\n\n# Heaviest element is Aluminum. It is present as 1 atom of Al.\n# Mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27.\nmass_of_heaviest_element_atoms = 1 * 27\n\n# The cumulative mass is the sum of these two values.\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_lightest_element_atoms + mass_of_heaviest_element_atoms\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```",
