    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This describes the distribution of stars as a function of their parallax. In mathematical terms, this means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is asking for the functional form of `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to a star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:**\n    We need to find `d(plx)/dr`.\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Transform the Distribution Function:**\n    When transforming a distribution from one variable to another (from `plx` to `r`), we are interested in the density, which must be a positive quantity. Therefore, we use the absolute value of the derivative (this is the Jacobian of the transformation for a single variable).\n    The relationship is: `Density(r) = Density(plx(r)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    In our notation: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Known Relationships:**\n    First, we express the given distribution `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r` using `plx = 1/r`:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    Now, substitute this and the absolute value of the derivative into our chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * |-1/r²|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r³`. This means the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as the cube of the distance.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r²\nB) ~ r⁵\nC) ~ r³\nD) ~ r⁴\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
