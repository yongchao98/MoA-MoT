    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with a bulky group like tert-butyl adjacent to two other substituents, is sterically hindered and challenging to achieve through direct substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving blocking groups or the modification of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option. A common strategy in such problems is to identify any chemically nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the diazotization of an amine formed in step (iv). Step (vi) involves reacting the resulting diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard or logical transformation for a diazonium salt. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iii) is the sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The product is a sulfonic acid. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), but this reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), which is not present. This sequence is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Similar to option B, this sequence involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard synthetic step for introducing a sulfonic acid group in this manner. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This option does not contain any fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Each reagent is used in a context where a reaction can occur. Let's analyze the sequence in detail to see if it leads to the target product.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nLet's trace the reaction path for option A.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is *o,p*-directing, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In strong acid (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n    *   Substrate: 4-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ is at C1 and -tBu is at C4.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to the positions *meta* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the positions *ortho* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 or C5).\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt**: This is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, we have synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The target is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. Our product is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. The difference is the position of the tert-butyl group (C2 vs. C4).\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. Under these acidic and heating conditions, reversible Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur, leading to the migration of the tert-butyl group. The reaction mixture equilibrates towards the most thermodynamically stable isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the stability of the isomer we have (1-ethoxy-4-tBu-3-nitrobenzene) and the target isomer (1-ethoxy-2-tBu-3-nitrobenzene).\n    *   **Our isomer**: The tBu group is at C4, which is *para* to the activating -OEt group and *ortho* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   **Target isomer**: The tBu group is at C2, which is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups. This position is extremely sterically hindered.\n    *   The rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly crowded C2 position is thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, this sequence will not produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the synthesis described in option A does not lead to the named target product via a straightforward thermodynamic argument, it is the only option that presents a chemically plausible sequence of reactions. Options B, C, and D contain steps that are nonsensical in standard organic synthesis (e.g., attempting diazotization without an amine, or reacting a diazonium salt with nitrating mixture). In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" answer. Option A is the best choice because it is free from the fundamental flaws that invalidate the other options. It is likely that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target molecule or in the design of the synthetic pathway. However, based on eliminating the impossible options, A remains the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
