This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   H\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   A mnemonic for stereochemistry is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The product is a trans-epoxide. For a symmetrically substituted alkene like oct-4-ene, this results in a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile (H₂O in this case) proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic for this is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this through the mechanism: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides reacts with water.\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → (4R,5S)-diol (a meso compound). Attack at C4 inverts it to S, attack at C5 inverts it to S. Wait, let's re-verify. Attack at C4 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains R, yielding (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C4 remains R, yielding (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → also yields the same (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is one achiral compound. Let's label it **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The mnemonic is that a *cis*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a meso compound.\n    *   The product is a cis-epoxide, which for a symmetrically substituted alkene is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify mechanistically: The meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide) reacts.\n        *   Attack at the C4 (R) carbon inverts its configuration to S. The C5 (S) configuration is retained. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the C5 (S) carbon inverts its configuration to R. The C4 (R) configuration is retained. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the attacks on C4 and C5 are equally probable, producing a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label these enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **HPLC Chromatogram Prediction**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times, thus separating into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (R vs. S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the unresolved racemic pair (R+S).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers (as any column can, in principle).\n    *   Crucially, it can also resolve enantiomers. The interactions (R)-chiral column and (S)-chiral column are diastereomeric and have different energies, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Since M, R, and S are all distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column can distinguish between all of them (diastereomers M vs. R/S, and enantiomers R vs. S), all three compounds will be resolved.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks: one for M, one for R, and one for S.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond, with a propyl group on each side.\n    ```\n        H       CH₂CH₂CH₃\n       / \\     /\n      C = C\n     /     \\   /\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂ H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    *   Products: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₂O.** The protonated epoxide is attacked by water in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. The overall process from alkene to diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound (when the alkene is symmetrical, as it is here).\n    *   Let's verify this. Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 (which are equivalent) will lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Similarly, starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide will lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   A compound with two equivalent chiral centers with (R,S) configuration is a meso compound. (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) are different labels for the same single meso molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n    ```\n        CH₃CH₂CH₂   CH₂CH₂CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1 & 2: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺.** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture (when the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's verify this. Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives a meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). Anti-attack by water on this meso-epoxide at C4 (which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Anti-attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since the starting meso-epoxide is achiral, the attacks are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2+3). The enantiomers (2 and 3) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, it can also separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct compounds in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using different chromatographic techniques.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    *   **Step 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid)**. This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Reacting the *trans*-alkene with mCPBA can occur from the top or bottom face, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)**. This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the epoxide ring, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a general rule for the stereochemistry of such additions:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso** compound (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry, which octane-4,5-diol does).\n\n    Let's verify this. Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water at either C4 or C5 will invert the stereocenter, leading to (4S,5R)- or (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are, in fact, the same meso compound. The same meso product is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** [(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol].\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:** The reagents and overall transformation are the same as in Reaction 1: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    Let's verify. The epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide [(cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane]. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening involves water attacking the two prochiral carbons (C4 and C5) from the backside. Attack at C4 and attack at C5 are equally probable and lead to a pair of enantiomeric products.\n    Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis (HPLC)**\n\nThe question assumes the highest theoretically possible resolution.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the (4R,5R)/(4S,5S) pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated on a standard achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which causes them to have different retention times.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *trans* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the planar double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face yields the (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face yields the (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Thus, this step produces a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Another key stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the product structure allows for it). The mnemonic \"Trans-Anti-Meso\" (T.A.M) can be helpful here.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the racemic epoxide from the previous step.\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide: The incoming water molecule attacks one of the carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack). This inverts the stereocenter it attacks. For example, attack at C4 changes its configuration from R to S. The resulting diol is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide: Similarly, anti-attack by water leads to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *cis* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   This is again a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *meso* compound (if the structure is symmetrical).\n    *   The (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry. The addition of oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the same, single product: the *cis*-epoxide, which is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   This is an *anti*-addition, making the overall process an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture. The mnemonic \"Cis-Anti-Racemic\" (C.A.R) applies.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The epoxide is protonated. Water can then attack either C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R): This inverts the configuration to S. The C5 configuration remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S): This inverts the configuration to R. The C4 configuration remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compound 1 is a *meso* compound.\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of *enantiomers*.\n*   Compound 1 is a *diastereomer* of both Compound 2 and Compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair (Compounds 2 and 3) will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like Compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 & 3) have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the chiral enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The two enantiomers (2 and 3) will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the double bond.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of an epoxide to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with backside attack, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (*syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (*anti*-opening) is stereochemically equivalent to a direct *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). This product is achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows for the separation of **enantiomers** because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule, so it is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attacking from one face produces one enantiomer of the epoxide, and attacking from the other face produces the other enantiomer.\n    *   The product of this step is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (Sₙ2-like). This process results in an anti-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   We have a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide, and we are performing an anti-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   Let's consider the stereochemical outcome. The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. A common rule in stereochemistry is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one of the carbons. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one carbon. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from S to R, while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The compounds (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide (also called a meso-epoxide in this case).\n    *   The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We are starting with a cis-alkene and performing an overall anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemistry rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   The meso-epoxide is attacked by water from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack).\n        *   Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed.\n    *   The products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso form is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute), appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-diol from the chiral diols (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The column will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA results in the formation of an epoxide via a *syn*-addition mechanism (the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The epoxide is then opened by nucleophilic attack of water under acidic conditions. This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). This two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (when the substituents on the double bond are identical, as they are here with two propyl groups).\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the products from Step 1a:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide (an enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide (the other enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is the same as (4S,5R)-diol).\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the *meso* compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single chemical compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   The product is *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a single achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   Again, this is an *anti*-addition mechanism. According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the product from Step 2a:\n        *   The *meso* epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has two enantiotopic carbon atoms (C4 and C5).\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C4 (the R center) will invert its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C5 (the S center) will invert its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This consists of two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Thus, the achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will differentiate between the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers, causing them to elute at different times. This will result in two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound is also a distinct molecule and will have its own unique retention time, different from both enantiomers. It will produce a third peak.\n    *   Thus, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a center of inversion.\n    ```\n       H      C3H7\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7    H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + syn-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Let's call them E(R,R) and E(S,S).\n\n*   **Step 1b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid protonates the epoxide's oxygen, making it a good leaving group. Water then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring. This nucleophilic attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the site of attack (SN2-like mechanism). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the ring-opening for each enantiomeric epoxide:\n        *   **For the (4R,5R)-epoxide (E(R,R))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same **meso** compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n        *   **For the (4S,5S)-epoxide (E(S,S))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Again, both attacks lead to the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H      H\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7  C3H7\n    ```\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + syn-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+) (anti-addition).**\n    *   We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic.\n    *   Water attacks the protonated epoxide:\n        *   Attack at C4 (which has S configuration): Inversion at C4 (S → R). The product configuration is (4R, 5R).\n        *   Attack at C5 (which has R configuration): Inversion at C5 (R → S). The product configuration is (4S, 5S).\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at either enantiotopic carbon is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts, resulting in a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol compared to the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol (which is achiral) will elute as a single peak. Since it is a diastereomer of the other two, its retention time will be different from both.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 C=C\n               H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene will yield a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction must produce an achiral product or a racemic mixture of chiral products. Attacking the planar alkene from the top face or the bottom face results in two different products that are mirror images of each other. These are the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Product of epoxidation: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen (an Sₙ2-like backside attack), resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two -OH groups.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. There is a useful mnemonic for this: \"**T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso\" (TAM). When the alkene is symmetrically substituted (as oct-4-ene is), a *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a center of inversion, making it a *meso* compound and therefore achiral.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 C=C\n               H     H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene yields a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the same *anti*-dihydroxylation as in Reaction 1.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The mnemonic here is \"**C**is-**A**nti-**E**nantiomers\" (CAE). A symmetrically substituted *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the *meso*-epoxide (let's say it's 4R,5S) via backside attack.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\nNow, let's predict the chromatograms:\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   One peak for the co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol (it is a diastereomer to the other two).\n    *   One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   One peak for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1.  Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is a standard epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an S_N2-like fashion, which means it attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** A *syn*-addition (epoxidation) followed by an *anti*-addition (hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene produces a *meso*-compound (if the resulting molecule has the potential for a plane of symmetry, which octan-4,5-diol does).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the achiral meso-compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. Like its E-isomer, it is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated. They will elute from the column at the exact same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   As a result, a chiral column can separate enantiomers from each other. It can also, of course, separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two stereospecific reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation of the resulting product mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      H\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      Pr   (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn-addition* across the double bond. The oxygen atom adds to both carbons from the same face of the alkene.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the \"top\" face or the \"bottom\" face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top and bottom faces of the trans-alkene produces two different stereoisomers of the epoxide, which are enantiomers to each other.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   So, the first step produces a **racemic mixture** of epoxides.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sɴ2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbon atoms of the ring. This is an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (S → R), while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) designations describe the exact same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a center of inversion, making it a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      Pr\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn-addition* of oxygen to the cis-alkene can happen from the top or bottom face. However, due to the symmetry of the cis-alkene, both modes of attack produce the same, single achiral epoxide. This product is a **meso epoxide**, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide will occur.\n    *   The overall reaction is again *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   The starting epoxide is the meso compound (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C4 (which is R) will invert it to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C5 (which is S) will invert it to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   (4S,5S) and (4R,5R) are non-superimposable mirror images, i.e., they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the attack at C4 and C5 is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The Meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by achiral HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will form one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral HPLC. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the **meso-diol** from the two chiral diols, as it is a diastereomer and will have a different interaction with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans* alkene. It is achiral.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** mCPBA adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion (both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene). This reaction converts (E)-oct-4-ene into *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane. Because the starting material is symmetrical, attack from either face yields the same single, achiral (meso) epoxide.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** Aqueous acid protonates the epoxide, and water attacks as a nucleophile. This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. This overall process is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *trans* (E) alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis* alkene. It is also achiral.\n    *   **Step 1 & 2:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in an overall *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *cis* (Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.

Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** (the meso-diol vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. They will be separated and elute at different times.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved pair of enantiomers.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This environment interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n        *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n        *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture. It will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the product mixture will produce:\n*   **2 peaks** in standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene will form a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Let's call this racemic epoxide mixture **E-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid. This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism is SN2-like, proceeding with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's C-O bond).\n    *   Starting with the racemic **E-Epoxide** and performing an *anti*-addition leads to a meso diol.\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are actually the *same* molecule. This molecule has a center of inversion and is achiral, making it a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: A common mnemonic for dihydroxylation is **TRAM**: **T**rans-alkene + **R**acemic intermediate (from syn-addition) -> **M**eso product (from anti-opening).

This single product is achiral.

Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. Thus, the meso-diol will have a different retention time and elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso-compound) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   The enantiomers (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also have a different retention time and will be resolved as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the meso-compound) + 1 (for the R,R-enantiomer) + 1 (for the S,S-enantiomer) = **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemistry of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using two different types of HPLC.\n\nLet's break down each reaction:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to form an epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water, is an anti-addition of the second hydroxyl group. The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups across the double bond in an anti-fashion.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this racemic mixture opens the epoxides. Let's analyze one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion of configuration, leading to an S configuration at C4. The configuration at C5 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is R) causes an inversion, leading to an S configuration at C5. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two potential products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are in fact the same single molecule because it is a meso compound (it has stereocenters but is achiral due to a center of inversion). The reaction of the other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same meso diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1**: A single product is formed, which is the meso compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (which can be named (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a single achiral meso epoxide: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (which can be named (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this meso-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion to S. The configuration at C5 (S) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) causes an inversion to R. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at the two equivalent carbons (C4 and C5) is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call them **P** and **P'**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P'**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **P** and **P'** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **P** and **P'**. (For example, compare M=(4R,5S) to P=(4R,5R); they have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C4).\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC**:\n    *   Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, compound **M** will have a different retention time from **P** and **P'**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, **P** and **P'** will have the exact same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for M, and one for the P/P' pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment where enantiomers can interact differently and thus be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (**P** and **P'**) will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (**M** vs. **P** and **P'**) are also separated.\n    *   **Compound M** is achiral (meso), so it will appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers. It will show **3 peaks**: one for M, one for P, and one for P'.\n\n### Summary of Observations\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture using two different types of chromatography.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step process results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. Specifically, a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups. A useful mnemonic for this type of reaction is: **\"Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, acid-catalyzed attack by water at C4 leads to the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since oct-4-ene is symmetrical, the resulting diol (octane-4,5-diol) has two identical substituents on the stereogenic carbons (a propyl group and a hydrogen). Therefore, the (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) configurations represent the same single, achiral **meso** compound. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also lead to the same meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a cis-alkene. This syn-addition yields a meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (this is the cis-epoxide).\n    *   The second step is the anti-addition opening of this meso-epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is: **\"Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide, attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration from S to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol, are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** (50:50) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **P+** and **P-**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol)\n2.  **P+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol)\n3.  **P-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   P+ and P- are **enantiomers**.\n*   M is a **diastereomer** of both P+ and P-.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. P+/P-) have different physical properties and will thus have different retention times, leading to separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (like P+ and P-) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the racemic pair (P+ and P-).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three compounds (M, P+, and P-) are distinct stereoisomers, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Enantiomers P+ and P- will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The diastereomer M will also have a different retention time from both P+ and P-.\n    *   Assuming ideal resolution, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for M, one for P+, and one for P-.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   H\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   A mnemonic for stereochemistry is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The product is a trans-epoxide. For a symmetrically substituted alkene like oct-4-ene, this results in a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile (H₂O in this case) proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic for this is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this through the mechanism: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides reacts with water.\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → (4R,5S)-diol (a meso compound). Attack at C4 inverts it to S, attack at C5 inverts it to S. Wait, let's re-verify. Attack at C4 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains R, yielding (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C4 remains R, yielding (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → also yields the same (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is one achiral compound. Let's label it **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.

The C5 (S) configuration is retained. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the C5 (S) carbon inverts its configuration to R. The C4 (R) configuration is retained. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the attacks on C4 and C5 are equally probable, producing a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label these enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **HPLC Chromatogram Prediction**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times, thus separating into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (R vs. S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the unresolved racemic pair (R+S).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers (as any column can, in principle).\n    *   Crucially, it can also resolve enantiomers. The interactions (R)-chiral column and (S)-chiral column are diastereomeric and have different energies, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Since M, R, and S are all distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column can distinguish between all of them (diastereomers M vs. R/S, and enantiomers R vs. S), all three compounds will be resolved.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks: one for M, one for R, and one for S.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond, with a propyl group on each side.\n    ```\n        H       CH₂CH₂CH₃\n       / \\     /\n      C = C\n     /     \\   /\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂ H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    *   Products: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₂O.** The protonated epoxide is attacked by water in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. The overall process from alkene to diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound (when the alkene is symmetrical, as it is here).\n    *   Let's verify this. Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 (which are equivalent) will lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Similarly, starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide will lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   A compound with two equivalent chiral centers with (R,S) configuration is a meso compound. (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) are different labels for the same single meso molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n    ```\n        CH₃CH₂CH₂   CH₂CH₂CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1 & 2: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺.** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture (when the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's verify this. Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives a meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). Anti-attack by water on this meso-epoxide at C4 (which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Anti-attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since the starting meso-epoxide is achiral, the attacks are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2+3). The enantiomers (2 and 3) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, it can also separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct compounds in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using different chromatographic techniques.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    *   **Step 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid)**. This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Reacting the *trans*-alkene with mCPBA can occur from the top or bottom face, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)**. This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the epoxide ring, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a general rule for the stereochemistry of such additions:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso** compound (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry, which octane-4,5-diol does).\n\n    Let's verify this. Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water at either C4 or C5 will invert the stereocenter, leading to (4S,5R)- or (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are, in fact, the same meso compound. The same meso product is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** [(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol].\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:** The reagents and overall transformation are the same as in Reaction 1: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    Let's verify. The epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide [(cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane]. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening involves water attacking the two prochiral carbons (C4 and C5) from the backside. Attack at C4 and attack at C5 are equally probable and lead to a pair of enantiomeric products.\n    Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis (HPLC)**\n\nThe question assumes the highest theoretically possible resolution.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the (4R,5R)/(4S,5S) pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated on a standard achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which causes them to have different retention times.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *trans* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the planar double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face yields the (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face yields the (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Thus, this step produces a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Another key stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the product structure allows for it). The mnemonic \"Trans-Anti-Meso\" (T.A.M) can be helpful here.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the racemic epoxide from the previous step.\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide: The incoming water molecule attacks one of the carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack). This inverts the stereocenter it attacks. For example, attack at C4 changes its configuration from R to S. The resulting diol is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide: Similarly, anti-attack by water leads to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *cis* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   This is again a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *meso* compound (if the structure is symmetrical).\n    *   The (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry. The addition of oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the same, single product: the *cis*-epoxide, which is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   This is an *anti*-addition, making the overall process an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture. The mnemonic \"Cis-Anti-Racemic\" (C.A.R) applies.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The epoxide is protonated. Water can then attack either C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R): This inverts the configuration to S. The C5 configuration remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S): This inverts the configuration to R. The C4 configuration remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compound 1 is a *meso* compound.\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of *enantiomers*.\n*   Compound 1 is a *diastereomer* of both Compound 2 and Compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair (Compounds 2 and 3) will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like Compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 & 3) have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the chiral enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The two enantiomers (2 and 3) will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the double bond.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of an epoxide to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with backside attack, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (*syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (*anti*-opening) is stereochemically equivalent to a direct *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). This product is achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows for the separation of **enantiomers** because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule, so it is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attacking from one face produces one enantiomer of the epoxide, and attacking from the other face produces the other enantiomer.\n    *   The product of this step is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (Sₙ2-like). This process results in an anti-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   We have a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide, and we are performing an anti-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   Let's consider the stereochemical outcome. The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. A common rule in stereochemistry is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one of the carbons. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one carbon. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from S to R, while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The compounds (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide (also called a meso-epoxide in this case).\n    *   The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We are starting with a cis-alkene and performing an overall anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemistry rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   The meso-epoxide is attacked by water from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack).\n        *   Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed.\n    *   The products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso form is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute), appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-diol from the chiral diols (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The column will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA results in the formation of an epoxide via a *syn*-addition mechanism (the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The epoxide is then opened by nucleophilic attack of water under acidic conditions. This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). This two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (when the substituents on the double bond are identical, as they are here with two propyl groups).\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the products from Step 1a:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide (an enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide (the other enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is the same as (4S,5R)-diol).\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the *meso* compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single chemical compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   The product is *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a single achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   Again, this is an *anti*-addition mechanism. According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the product from Step 2a:\n        *   The *meso* epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has two enantiotopic carbon atoms (C4 and C5).\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C4 (the R center) will invert its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C5 (the S center) will invert its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This consists of two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Thus, the achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will differentiate between the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers, causing them to elute at different times. This will result in two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound is also a distinct molecule and will have its own unique retention time, different from both enantiomers. It will produce a third peak.\n    *   Thus, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a center of inversion.\n    ```\n       H      C3H7\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7    H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + syn-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Let's call them E(R,R) and E(S,S).\n\n*   **Step 1b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid protonates the epoxide's oxygen, making it a good leaving group. Water then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring. This nucleophilic attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the site of attack (SN2-like mechanism). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the ring-opening for each enantiomeric epoxide:\n        *   **For the (4R,5R)-epoxide (E(R,R))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same **meso** compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n        *   **For the (4S,5S)-epoxide (E(S,S))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Again, both attacks lead to the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H      H\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7  C3H7\n    ```\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + syn-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+) (anti-addition).**\n    *   We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic.\n    *   Water attacks the protonated epoxide:\n        *   Attack at C4 (which has S configuration): Inversion at C4 (S → R). The product configuration is (4R, 5R).\n        *   Attack at C5 (which has R configuration): Inversion at C5 (R → S). The product configuration is (4S, 5S).\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at either enantiotopic carbon is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts, resulting in a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol compared to the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol (which is achiral) will elute as a single peak. Since it is a diastereomer of the other two, its retention time will be different from both.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 C=C\n               H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene will yield a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction must produce an achiral product or a racemic mixture of chiral products. Attacking the planar alkene from the top face or the bottom face results in two different products that are mirror images of each other. These are the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Product of epoxidation: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen (an Sₙ2-like backside attack), resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two -OH groups.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. There is a useful mnemonic for this: \"**T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso\" (TAM). When the alkene is symmetrically substituted (as oct-4-ene is), a *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a center of inversion, making it a *meso* compound and therefore achiral.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 C=C\n               H     H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene yields a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the same *anti*-dihydroxylation as in Reaction 1.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The mnemonic here is \"**C**is-**A**nti-**E**nantiomers\" (CAE). A symmetrically substituted *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the *meso*-epoxide (let's say it's 4R,5S) via backside attack.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\nNow, let's predict the chromatograms:\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1.  Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is a standard epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an S_N2-like fashion, which means it attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** A *syn*-addition (epoxidation) followed by an *anti*-addition (hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene produces a *meso*-compound (if the resulting molecule has the potential for a plane of symmetry, which octan-4,5-diol does).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the achiral meso-compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. Like its E-isomer, it is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated. They will elute from the column at the exact same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   As a result, a chiral column can separate enantiomers from each other. It can also, of course, separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two stereospecific reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation of the resulting product mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene.

The oxygen atom adds to both carbons from the same face of the alkene.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the \"top\" face or the \"bottom\" face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top and bottom faces of the trans-alkene produces two different stereoisomers of the epoxide, which are enantiomers to each other.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   So, the first step produces a **racemic mixture** of epoxides.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sɴ2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbon atoms of the ring. This is an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (S → R), while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) designations describe the exact same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a center of inversion, making it a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      Pr\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn-addition* of oxygen to the cis-alkene can happen from the top or bottom face. However, due to the symmetry of the cis-alkene, both modes of attack produce the same, single achiral epoxide. This product is a **meso epoxide**, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide will occur.\n    *   The overall reaction is again *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   The starting epoxide is the meso compound (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C4 (which is R) will invert it to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C5 (which is S) will invert it to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   (4S,5S) and (4R,5R) are non-superimposable mirror images, i.e., they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the attack at C4 and C5 is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The Meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by achiral HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will form one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral HPLC. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the **meso-diol** from the two chiral diols, as it is a diastereomer and will have a different interaction with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans* alkene. It is achiral.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** mCPBA adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion (both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene). This reaction converts (E)-oct-4-ene into *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane. Because the starting material is symmetrical, attack from either face yields the same single, achiral (meso) epoxide.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** Aqueous acid protonates the epoxide, and water attacks as a nucleophile. This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. This overall process is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *trans* (E) alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis* alkene. It is also achiral.\n    *   **Step 1 & 2:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in an overall *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *cis* (Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n        *   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n        *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   **Enantiomers** ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** (the meso-diol vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. They will be separated and elute at different times.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved pair of enantiomers.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This environment interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n        *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n        *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture. It will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the product mixture will produce:\n*   **2 peaks** in standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene will form a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Let's call this racemic epoxide mixture **E-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid. This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism is SN2-like, proceeding with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's C-O bond).\n    *   Starting with the racemic **E-Epoxide** and performing an *anti*-addition leads to a meso diol.\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are actually the *same* molecule. This molecule has a center of inversion and is achiral, making it a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: A common mnemonic for dihydroxylation is **TRAM**: **T**rans-alkene + **R**acemic intermediate (from syn-addition) -> **M**eso product (from anti-opening). Or more directly for the overall reaction: **Trans + Anti = Meso**)*\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   When a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene will form meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). This single product is achiral. Let's call it **Z-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso* **Z-Epoxide** undergoes *anti*-addition of H₂O.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) of the meso-epoxide will give one enantiomer of the diol, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will give the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: The counterpart to the one above is **CAR**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition -> **R**acemic product)*\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. Thus, the meso-diol will have a different retention time and elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso-compound) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   The enantiomers (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also have a different retention time and will be resolved as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the meso-compound) + 1 (for the R,R-enantiomer) + 1 (for the S,S-enantiomer) = **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemistry of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using two different types of HPLC.\n\nLet's break down each reaction:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to form an epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water, is an anti-addition of the second hydroxyl group. The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups across the double bond in an anti-fashion.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this racemic mixture opens the epoxides. Let's analyze one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion of configuration, leading to an S configuration at C4. The configuration at C5 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is R) causes an inversion, leading to an S configuration at C5. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two potential products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are in fact the same single molecule because it is a meso compound (it has stereocenters but is achiral due to a center of inversion). The reaction of the other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same meso diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1**: A single product is formed, which is the meso compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (which can be named (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a single achiral meso epoxide: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (which can be named (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this meso-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion to S. The configuration at C5 (S) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) causes an inversion to R. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at the two equivalent carbons (C4 and C5) is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call them **P** and **P'**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P'**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **P** and **P'** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **P** and **P'**. (For example, compare M=(4R,5S) to P=(4R,5R); they have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C4).\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC**:\n    *   Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, compound **M** will have a different retention time from **P** and **P'**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, **P** and **P'** will have the exact same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for M, and one for the P/P' pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment where enantiomers can interact differently and thus be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (**P** and **P'**) will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (**M** vs. **P** and **P'**) are also separated.\n    *   **Compound M** is achiral (meso), so it will appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers. It will show **3 peaks**: one for M, one for P, and one for P'.\n\n### Summary of Observations\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture using two different types of chromatography.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step process results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. Specifically, a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups. A useful mnemonic for this type of reaction is: **\"Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, acid-catalyzed attack by water at C4 leads to the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since oct-4-ene is symmetrical, the resulting diol (octane-4,5-diol) has two identical substituents on the stereogenic carbons (a propyl group and a hydrogen). Therefore, the (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) configurations represent the same single, achiral **meso** compound. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also lead to the same meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a cis-alkene. This syn-addition yields a meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (this is the cis-epoxide).\n    *   The second step is the anti-addition opening of this meso-epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is: **\"Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide, attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration from S to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol, are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** (50:50) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **P+** and **P-**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol)\n2.  **P+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol)\n3.  **P-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   P+ and P- are **enantiomers**.\n*   M is a **diastereomer** of both P+ and P-.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. P+/P-) have different physical properties and will thus have different retention times, leading to separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (like P+ and P-) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the racemic pair (P+ and P-).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three compounds (M, P+, and P-) are distinct stereoisomers, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Enantiomers P+ and P- will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The diastereomer M will also have a different retention time from both P+ and P-.\n    *   Assuming ideal resolution, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for M, one for P+, and one for P-.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
