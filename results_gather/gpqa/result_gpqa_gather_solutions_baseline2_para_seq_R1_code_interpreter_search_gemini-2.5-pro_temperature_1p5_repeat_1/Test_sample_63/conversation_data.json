Deconstruction of the Experimental Setup**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of reactive tubes. Let's analyze the function of each tube to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it tells us that **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper, Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen most likely came from O₂ gas (in which case moles of O₂ = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to a strong dehydrating agent, a base, and hot copper, it is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source), we can deduce that the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThe calculated mass matches the given mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles ('n') of salt A and salt B.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\nLet's check if the total elemental moles match our findings for an equimolar mixture of these two salts.\n*   Total moles of H = n × (4) + n × (4) = 8n. We found 0.40 mol of H. So, 8n = 0.40  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of N = n × (2) + n × (2) = 4n. We found 0.20 mol of N. So, 4n = 0.20  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of O = n × (2) + n × (3) = 5n. We found 0.25 mol of O. So, 5n = 0.25  => n = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give n = 0.05 mol. This confirms that the equimolar mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The fact that its weight did not change means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (did not react in tube 2). Plausible candidates are O₂ or a neutral oxide of nitrogen like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into the gas mixture. By the law of conservation of mass, the mass and elemental composition of the salts must equal the mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source like N₂O or O₂) are composed only of H, O, and N.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\nWe have the total elemental molar content of the equimolar mixture of A and B: N(0.2 mol), H(0.4 mol), O(0.25 mol).\nLet's find the ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B):\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for an equimolar amount of A and B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe problem states A and B are salts. The presence of N, H, and O, and the decomposition into gases suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids.\n*   The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\nWe need to partition the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two salt formulas, A and B, which are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nSince we need a total of 8 hydrogen atoms, and the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) has 4, it is logical to assume each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nThis accounts for N₂H₈ in total. The remaining atoms to be distributed between the anions X⁻ and Y⁻ are:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\nSo, the combined formula of the two anions is X⁻ + Y⁻ = N₂O₅.\nThe most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is:\n*   Anion X⁻ = NO₃⁻\n*   Anion Y⁻ = NO₂⁻\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived total: N₂H₄O₃ + N₂H₄O₂ = N₄H₈O₅. It matches perfectly.\n\n*(Self-consistency check: The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₂ gives N₂ + 2H₂O. The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C gives N₂O + 2H₂O. An equimolar mixture would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. N₂O would be the gas that oxidizes the hot copper, and N₂ would be the final inert gas C. This is fully consistent with our analysis.)*\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is interpreted as the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and identify the products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a gas mixture. This means no solid residue is left.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂ that reacted.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each product.**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Moles of O₂:**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂\n\n*   **Moles and identity of Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol Gas C.\n    *   We can find the mass of Gas C by the law of conservation of mass:\n        *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This makes sense, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose to produce N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the original salts.**\n\nThe salts A and B must contain the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts (A and B) containing H, N, and O that decompose on heating to give H₂O, O₂, and N₂. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): Decomposes as NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): At higher temperatures (~250-300°C), it can decompose as 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of **NH₄NO₂ (Salt A)** and **NH₄NO₃ (Salt B)**. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n\nNow, let's compare this with our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experiment)\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**5. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g (Matches the initial mass)\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B** (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Absorption Data**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect and absorb acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass increase = 0 g.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or organic anions that would decompose to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂).\n    *   The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol of Gas C\n\nThe original salts are heated \"without air\". The products must come from the elements within the salts. The gases H₂O and O₂ are composed of H and O. What could Gas C be? Given that it passed through all the tubes without reacting, it must be a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas produced from heating nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the law of conservation of mass holds.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture**\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles H = 2 × moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles N = 2 × moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles O = (1 × moles H₂O) + (2 × moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained only H, N, and O atoms. The problem states the mixture consists of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B, let's call it (A+B), must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O corresponding to the molar ratio we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest number (0.05):\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (A+B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify the Individual Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). If we have two salts, we likely have two ammonium cations.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be the sum of the two anions in salts A and B. The most common and simple nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's check if they sum to N₂O₅: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ → N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\n*   NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the number of moles (`n`).\nMolar mass of (A+B) = M(N₄H₈O₅) = 4(14) + 8(1) + 5(16) = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\nTotal mass of mixture = `n` × M(A+B) = 7.20 g\n`n` = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\nSo we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's see if this produces the correct amount of gas:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio) → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Total products:**\n    *   N₂: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   H₂O: 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol (Matches)\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

The gas produced is not H₂O, not O₂, and not an acidic gas. The most plausible identity for Gas C, formed from heating nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. By the law of conservation of mass, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of the elements in the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) * 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O * 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 32.0 g/mol O₂) - Mass O in O₂ = (0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol) + 0.80 g = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.10 mol N₂ * 28.0 g/mol N₂ = 2.80 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g (H) + 4.00 g (O) + 2.80 g (N) = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our identification of the products.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two salts made of N, H, and O.\n    *   The most common cation formed from H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   Common anions formed from N and O are the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) ions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidates for salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\n4.  **Use stoichiometry to confirm the identities and quantities.**\n    *   Let `n` be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture).\n    *   Consider the known thermal decomposition reactions:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)** (This reaction occurs under specific conditions but fits our products).\n    *   Let's write equations for the total moles of each product based on `n` moles of each salt:\n        *   Total moles N₂ = n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n        *   Total moles H₂O = 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n        *   Total moles O₂ = 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃) = 0.5n\n    *   Now, we use our experimental mole data to solve for `n`:\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   Let's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n        *   N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.

This typically refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two distinct compounds.\n    *   Salt A: **NH₄NO₂**. Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Salt B: **NH₄NO₃**. Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 (from salt A) + 9 (from salt B) = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of traps to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (`H₂O`) produced during the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test, used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (`CO₂`), which would form a precipitate (`CaCO₃`). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no `CO₂` or other acidic gas was present in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. The reaction involves the copper being oxidized to copper(II) oxide (`CuO`). The mass increase is solely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas (C) remains under standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a Hypothesis about the Salts' Identities**\n\nThe decomposition produces `H₂O`, an oxygen-donating gas, and another inert gas, but no `CO₂`. The presence of H, O, and N (as a likely component of the inert gas) points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. Two common examples that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are `NH₄NO₂` and `NH₄NO₃`. Their decomposition reactions upon heating are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nSo, the initial gas mixture would contain `N₂`, `N₂O`, and `H₂O`.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis Quantitatively**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A (`NH₄NO₂`) and also `n` for salt B (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):** From the reactions, `NH₄NO₂` produces `2n` moles of H₂O, and `NH₄NO₃` also produces `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`.\n    *   From our analysis in step 1, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Therefore, `4n = 0.20` mol, which means `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen for Tube №3:** Let's see which gas reacts with the hot copper. `N₂` is very stable and would not react. `N₂O` (nitrous oxide) will decompose on hot copper in the reaction: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, `n` moles of `N₂O` are produced.\n    *   Each mole of `N₂O` contains one mole of oxygen atoms. Thus, `n` moles of `N₂O` provide `n` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   From step 1, we know 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 0.05` mol. This result is consistent with the value of `n` we calculated from the amount of water.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** Gas C is what's left after Tube 3. The gases entering Tube 3 are `N₂` and `N₂O`.\n    *   `N₂` from `NH₄NO₂` decomposition: `n` moles.\n    *   `N₂O` from `NH₄NO₃` decomposition: `n` moles. This reacts completely to form `N₂` gas: `N₂O → N₂ + [O]`.\n    *   So, the total moles of `N₂` (Gas C) exiting Tube 3 is the initial `n` moles plus the `n` moles from the `N₂O` reaction.\n    *   Total moles of Gas C = `n + n = 2n`.\n    *   Using `n = 0.05` mol, the moles of Gas C = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10` mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C we calculated from the volume in step 1.\n\n**4. Check the Initial Mass**\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all products. Let's check if the initial mass is also correct.\n\n*   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n*   Total mass = `(0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)`\n*   Total mass = `3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g`.\nThis matches the given initial weight. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing only a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the effect on each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass did not change, which means no such acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) trapped by Cu = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The source of this oxygen could be O₂ gas (reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or an oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide, N₂O (reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). Both scenarios involve 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms being transferred.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas passed through all tubes unreacted, it must be inert. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of the Salts**\n\nLet's work backward from the products to identify the original salts.\nThe decomposition produced H, N, and O atoms. This means salts A and B must be compounds containing these elements. The fact that they decompose completely into gases suggests they might be ammonium salts.\n\nLet's consider two plausible chemical scenarios for the decomposition. Both lead to the same answer.\n\n**Scenario A (Decomposition to N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is O₂.\n*   Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol, so moles of O₂ molecules = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   The gas mixture produced was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n*   The molar ratio of products is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20. Dividing by 0.025 gives a simple integer ratio of **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\n**Scenario B (Decomposition to N₂, N₂O, H₂O - Chemically more likely at 200°C):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is N₂O.\n*   The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To trap 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of the N₂ from this reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was initially produced and passed through Tube 3 unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the original gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n**3. Test the Hypothesized Salts**\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** fits our data.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet the equimolar amount of each salt in the initial mixture be 'n' moles.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n moles\n*   Total N₂O = n moles\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nNow, we match this with the products derived in Scenario B:\n*   Total N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results match perfectly. Thus, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass matches the value given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n**1. Identify the products and their quantities:**\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Reacts with oxygen (O₂) via 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at STP. This gas did not react with the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total mass of the products is 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (O₂) + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol N₂) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This equals the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming that Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the salts A and B:**\nThe decomposition produces H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\nLet's consider the decomposition of two such salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet the mixture contain *n* moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and *n* moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃) since it is an equimolar mixture.\n\n**3. Set up stoichiometric equations:**\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₂, we get: *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₃, we get: *n* mol N₂ (from 0.5*n* of the 2-mol reaction), 0.5*n* mol O₂, and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2*n + 2*n = 4*n\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0 + 0.5*n = 0.5*n\n*   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2*n\n\n**4. Solve for *n*:**\nWe can use any of the product quantities to find *n*. Using oxygen is the most direct:\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5*n = 0.025 mol\n*   *n* = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol\n\nLet's verify this value of *n* with the other products:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = 2*n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4*n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n\nThe identities of the salts are confirmed as **NH₄NO₂** (Salt A) and **NH₄NO₃** (Salt B).\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\nThe question asks for the sum of the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Separation Process:**\n    *   The mixture of gases is passed through three tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, there were no acidic gases in the mixture. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have combined with the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   The total initial mass of salts was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert to the reagents used and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). So, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain only the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Salts that decompose upon heating to produce only these gases are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Decomposition reactions:**\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**. Let's say we have 'n' moles of A (NH₄NO₂) and 'n' moles of B (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   According to the stoichiometry of the reactions:\n        *   'n' mol NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n        *   'n' mol NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O (halving the second reaction's coefficients).\n    *   **Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = `2n` mol.\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = `0.5n` mol.\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = `4n` mol.\n    *   Now, we compare these expressions with our experimental results:\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025` ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Let's use `n = 0.05` to check the amounts of the other products:\n        *   Predicted Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (This matches our result for Gas C).\n        *   Predicted Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (This matches our result from Tube №1).\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Final Mass Check:**\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) = 14×2 + 1×4 + 16×2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = 14×2 + 1×4 + 16×3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial weight of the mixture perfectly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium nitrite):** Formula is NH₄NO₂, which can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium nitrate):** Formula is NH₄NO₃, which can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem is solved by analyzing the products of the decomposition to identify the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition was passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes were recorded.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is due to the oxygen consumed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and the Original Elements**\n\n*   By the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas that is unreactive under these conditions with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determination of the Empirical Formula and Identity of the Salts**\n\n*   Since the products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, the original salts A and B must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = 0.2 + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol.\n*   The molar ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B (as they are an equimolar mixture) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   Given that these are salts formed from N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions. The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining part, for the anions, is N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   Two common anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the salts are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n**4. Verification**\nLet's check the decomposition reactions.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   At 200°C, a relevant decomposition for ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   The python code execution confirms that a mixture of 0.05 mol of each salt has a total mass of 7.20 g. Let's check the products from these amounts:\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Total products:** 0.1 mol N₂, 0.2 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂. This perfectly matches our initial calculations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must come from an oxidizing gas in the mixture. Two main scenarios are possible:\n        *   **Scenario A:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n        *   **Scenario B:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 mol of N₂O gas. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of gas C at standard temperature and pressure (STP) remained.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nLet's evaluate both scenarios to see if they are consistent.\n\n*   **Scenario A:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly.\n\n*   **Scenario B:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O. The 0.1 mol of remaining gas is N₂. However, the reduction of N₂O also produces N₂. The total N₂ (0.1 mol) is the sum of the N₂ initially present and the N₂ produced from N₂O.\n    *   n(N₂ from N₂O) = n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    *   n(N₂ initial) = Total n(N₂) - n(N₂ from N₂O) = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the decomposition products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × n(N₂O)) + (2 × n(N₂)) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (1 × n(N₂O)) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   This yields the exact same elemental composition as Scenario A, which also sums to 7.20 g.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the data and lead to the same conclusion: the 7.20 g mixture contains **0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O, and decompose fully into gases. This strongly points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A common high-temperature decomposition of ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume we have *n* moles of each salt.\nIf A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃:\n*   *n* NH₄NO₂ produces *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   *n* NH₄NO₃ produces *n* mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + 2*n* mol H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio).\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow we match this with our findings from Scenario A: n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(O₂) = 0.025 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol.\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.025  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Check N₂: Total N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches)\n*   Check H₂O: Total H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (Matches)\n\nThe identification is correct. We have an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms in the salts.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Products**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the mass change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing carbon (carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is from the oxygen.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After the other gases were removed, a final gas C remained.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of Gas C**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass**\n\nThe elements in the products (H, O, and the element(s) in Gas C) must have come from the original salts A and B. Since no acidic gases were formed, the most likely candidate for a stable, unreactive gas produced from a salt is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the mass is conserved:\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass of the mixture. Our product identification is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. These are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's check their decomposition reactions.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate at ~200°C: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)**\n\nThis matches our observed products: N₂, H₂O, and O₂.\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ we get: `n` moles of N₂, `2n` moles of H₂O, and `0.5n` moles of O₂.\n\nNow, let's sum the products and compare them to our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ produced = `0.5n`. We measured 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05` mol**.\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `n` (from nitrite) + `n` (from nitrate) = `2n` = 2 × 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Total H₂O = `2n` (from nitrite) + `2n` (from nitrate) = `4n` = 4 × 0.05 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches.\n\nThe salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The problem describes the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant (drying agent). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a limewater test. A milky precipitate (CaCO₃) would form if acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present. Since the weight did not change, no such gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen consumed.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   Wait, the reaction shows the mass increase is the mass of O₂, not just O. Let's re-examine. `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The tube contains copper initially. The mass *increase* is the mass of the other reactant, which is O₂.\n        *   Okay, wait. Let's think carefully. If we have a tube of copper, and we pass O₂ through it, the copper turns into CuO. The mass of the *tube's contents* increases. The increase is the mass of the oxygen that has become part of the solid CuO. So the 0.80 g increase is the mass of atomic oxygen, not diatomic oxygen gas.\n        *   Let's check the wording again: \"the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3)\". This phrasing usually means the mass of the absorbed/reacted substance. For red-hot copper, it reacts with O₂ gas. The mass increase of the *copper* itself is the mass of oxygen atoms. So, mass of O is 0.80g.\n            *   Moles of O from this source = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This came from O₂ gas, so Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the first three steps, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the elements likely present (H, O from H₂O and O₂), and the fact that we're dealing with decomposing salts, a very common inert gaseous product is Nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:**\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.4 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.01 g/mol ≈ 2.8 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the produced H₂O and from the O that reacted with copper (which came from O₂ gas).\n        *   Moles of O from H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Moles of O that reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n3.  **Verify the Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n    *   **Find the Salt Formulas:** We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n        *   The overall ratio of atoms in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\n        *   To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the total atoms from one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B. We are looking for two common salts made of H, N, and O that add up to this composition.\n    *   These salts are typically ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's consider Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₂ is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₃ is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their atoms matches our ratio:\n        *   Total H = 4 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 4 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 8. (Matches)\n        *   Total N = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 2 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 4. (Matches)\n        *   Total O = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 3 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 5. (Matches)\n    *   The identification is successful. Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula unit of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed previously confirmed this calculation by taking the same logical steps and computing the total atoms from the identified formulas (N₂H₄O₂ and N₂H₄O₃). The output `17` is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\n    The mixture of gases from the heated salts is passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify the components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. Therefore, the mass of O₂ gas produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that does not react in any of the tubes remains. We have 2.24 L of this gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each product.**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.00 g/mol.\n        Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C:**\n        At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas C.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Total mass = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass (C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂), since the molar mass of N is ~14 g/mol (2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol).\n\n4.  **Determine the total elemental composition of the salts.**\n    The salts A and B must contain all the atoms found in the products (H, O, N), as nothing else was added.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n5.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The initial mixture contained an equimolar amount of salt A and salt B. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. The total atomic composition we found above (0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, 0.25 mol O) is distributed between `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\n    Let's find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A + B).\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\n    So, the combination of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must contain a total of 8 H atoms, 4 N atoms, and 5 O atoms.\n\n    The salts are formed from H, N, and O. Common salts of this type are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Let's see if we can construct the salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), which contains 1 N and 4 H.\n    *   Our total H atom count is 8. This corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × 4 H = 8 H).\n    *   This implies that each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion:\n        *   Salt A = NH₄(Anion_A)\n        *   Salt B = NH₄(Anion_B)\n    *   Now let's account for the remaining atoms. We have used 2 N atoms and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Remaining N atoms = 4 (total) - 2 (in NH₄⁺ ions) = 2 N atoms.\n        *   Remaining O atoms = 5 (total) - 0 = 5 O atoms.\n    *   These remaining 2 N and 5 O atoms must make up the two anions (Anion_A and Anion_B). Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit:\n        *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻) has 1 N and 2 O.\n        *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻) has 1 N and 3 O.\n    *   Total atoms from these two anions: (1+1) N and (2+3) O = 2 N and 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their formula units).\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nFinal check of the mass:\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 64.05 g/mol\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 80.05 g/mol\nLet's find the number of moles `n` from the product data. Based on the decomposition 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or 1 NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O), the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, where 0.5*n = 0.025, so n = 0.05 moles.\nLet's check the mass with n = 0.05 mol:\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol × (64.05 g/mol) + 0.05 mol × (80.05 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms our calculations.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "**Analysis of the Problem and Synthesis of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Identify Products and Moles from Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n        *   Moles H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since the mass did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Hot Cu):** This tube reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass of the *tube's contents* increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO from Cu. This mass increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen came from a gaseous molecule, most likely O₂ or N₂O. Regardless of the source molecule, a total of 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms were delivered to the copper.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas had a volume of 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    The gaseous products contain only hydrogen, oxygen, and the unknown Gas C. The initial salts must be composed of these elements. A mass conservation check confirms the identity of Gas C.\n    *   Total Mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g. The gas that contained this oxygen (e.g., O₂) had a mass of at least 0.80 g.\n    *   Let's calculate the total mass of each element from the products.\n        *   Total moles of Hydrogen (H) = Moles(H₂O) × 2 = 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol.\n        *   Total moles of Oxygen (O) = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   The remaining mass must be the element in Gas C: Mass = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n        *   Since we have 0.10 mol of Gas C, its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. The most common gas with this molar mass produced from salt decomposition is nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Total moles of Nitrogen (N) = Moles(N₂) × 2 = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol. (This is consistent with the mass: 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g).\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    The original 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined atomic formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B has a molar ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives the ratio N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   The combined formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since these are salts made of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   Subtracting the cations leaves the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   This N₂O₅ must be split between the two anions. The most common and stable nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   The sum of these two anions is (NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂.

Deconstruction of the Experimental Setup**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of reactive tubes. Let's analyze the function of each tube to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it tells us that **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper, Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen most likely came from O₂ gas (in which case moles of O₂ = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to a strong dehydrating agent, a base, and hot copper, it is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source), we can deduce that the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThe calculated mass matches the given mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles ('n') of salt A and salt B.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (contains 2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\nLet's check if the total elemental moles match our findings for an equimolar mixture of these two salts.\n*   Total moles of H = n × (4) + n × (4) = 8n. We found 0.40 mol of H. So, 8n = 0.40  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of N = n × (2) + n × (2) = 4n. We found 0.20 mol of N. So, 4n = 0.20  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of O = n × (2) + n × (3) = 5n. We found 0.25 mol of O. So, 5n = 0.25  => n = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give n = 0.05 mol. This confirms that the equimolar mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The fact that its weight did not change means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (did not react in tube 2). Plausible candidates are O₂ or a neutral oxide of nitrogen like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into the gas mixture. By the law of conservation of mass, the mass and elemental composition of the salts must equal the mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source like N₂O or O₂) are composed only of H, O, and N.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\nWe have the total elemental molar content of the equimolar mixture of A and B: N(0.2 mol), H(0.4 mol), O(0.25 mol).\nLet's find the ratio of atoms in the combined formula (A + B):\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for an equimolar amount of A and B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe problem states A and B are salts. The presence of N, H, and O, and the decomposition into gases suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids.\n*   The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\nWe need to partition the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two salt formulas, A and B, which are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nSince we need a total of 8 hydrogen atoms, and the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) has 4, it is logical to assume each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺X⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺Y⁻\n\nThis accounts for N₂H₈ in total. The remaining atoms to be distributed between the anions X⁻ and Y⁻ are:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\nSo, the combined formula of the two anions is X⁻ + Y⁻ = N₂O₅.\nThe most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is:\n*   Anion X⁻ = NO₃⁻\n*   Anion Y⁻ = NO₂⁻\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived total: N₂H₄O₃ + N₂H₄O₂ = N₄H₈O₅. It matches perfectly.\n\n*(Self-consistency check: The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₂ gives N₂ + 2H₂O. The decomposition of 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C gives N₂O + 2H₂O. An equimolar mixture would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. N₂O would be the gas that oxidizes the hot copper, and N₂ would be the final inert gas C. This is fully consistent with our analysis.)*\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is interpreted as the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and identify the products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a gas mixture. This means no solid residue is left.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂ that reacted.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each product.**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Moles of O₂:**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂\n\n*   **Moles and identity of Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol Gas C.\n    *   We can find the mass of Gas C by the law of conservation of mass:\n        *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This makes sense, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose to produce N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the original salts.**\n\nThe salts A and B must contain the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts (A and B) containing H, N, and O that decompose on heating to give H₂O, O₂, and N₂. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): Decomposes as NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): At higher temperatures (~250-300°C), it can decompose as 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of **NH₄NO₂ (Salt A)** and **NH₄NO₃ (Salt B)**. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n\nNow, let's compare this with our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experiment)\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**5. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g (Matches the initial mass)\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B** (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Absorption Data**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect and absorb acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass increase = 0 g.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or organic anions that would decompose to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂).\n    *   The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol of Gas C\n\nThe original salts are heated \"without air\". The products must come from the elements within the salts. The gases H₂O and O₂ are composed of H and O. What could Gas C be? Given that it passed through all the tubes without reacting, it must be a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas produced from heating nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the law of conservation of mass holds.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture**\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles H = 2 × moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles N = 2 × moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles O = (1 × moles H₂O) + (2 × moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained only H, N, and O atoms. The problem states the mixture consists of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B, let's call it (A+B), must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O corresponding to the molar ratio we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest number (0.05):\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (A+B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify the Individual Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). If we have two salts, we likely have two ammonium cations.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be the sum of the two anions in salts A and B. The most common and simple nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's check if they sum to N₂O₅: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ → N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\n*   NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the number of moles (`n`).\nMolar mass of (A+B) = M(N₄H₈O₅) = 4(14) + 8(1) + 5(16) = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\nTotal mass of mixture = `n` × M(A+B) = 7.20 g\n`n` = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\nSo we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's see if this produces the correct amount of gas:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio) → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Total products:**\n    *   N₂: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   H₂O: 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol (Matches)\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Number of Nitrogen atoms = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each salt:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An initial equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated. It decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). The mass of this tube did not change.\n        *   This is a crucial clue: **no CO₂ was produced.** Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   The decomposition occurred without air. The gas produced is not H₂O, not O₂, and not an acidic gas. The most plausible identity for Gas C, formed from heating nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. By the law of conservation of mass, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of the elements in the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) * 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O * 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 32.0 g/mol O₂) - Mass O in O₂ = (0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol) + 0.80 g = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.10 mol N₂ * 28.0 g/mol N₂ = 2.80 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g (H) + 4.00 g (O) + 2.80 g (N) = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our identification of the products.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two salts made of N, H, and O.\n    *   The most common cation formed from H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   Common anions formed from N and O are the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) ions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidates for salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\n4.  **Use stoichiometry to confirm the identities and quantities.**\n    *   Let `n` be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture).\n    *   Consider the known thermal decomposition reactions:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)** (This reaction occurs under specific conditions but fits our products).\n    *   Let's write equations for the total moles of each product based on `n` moles of each salt:\n        *   Total moles N₂ = n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n        *   Total moles H₂O = 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n        *   Total moles O₂ = 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃) = 0.5n\n    *   Now, we use our experimental mole data to solve for `n`:\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   Let's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n        *   N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.

This typically refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two distinct compounds.\n    *   Salt A: **NH₄NO₂**. Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Salt B: **NH₄NO₃**. Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 (from salt A) + 9 (from salt B) = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of traps to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (`H₂O`) produced during the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test, used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (`CO₂`), which would form a precipitate (`CaCO₃`). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no `CO₂` or other acidic gas was present in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. The reaction involves the copper being oxidized to copper(II) oxide (`CuO`). The mass increase is solely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas (C) remains under standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Formulate a Hypothesis about the Salts' Identities**\n\nThe decomposition produces `H₂O`, an oxygen-donating gas, and another inert gas, but no `CO₂`. The presence of H, O, and N (as a likely component of the inert gas) points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. Two common examples that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂`) and ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are `NH₄NO₂` and `NH₄NO₃`. Their decomposition reactions upon heating are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nSo, the initial gas mixture would contain `N₂`, `N₂O`, and `H₂O`.\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis Quantitatively**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A (`NH₄NO₂`) and also `n` for salt B (`NH₄NO₃`).\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):** From the reactions, `NH₄NO₂` produces `2n` moles of H₂O, and `NH₄NO₃` also produces `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`.\n    *   From our analysis in step 1, we know 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Therefore, `4n = 0.20` mol, which means `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen for Tube №3:** Let's see which gas reacts with the hot copper. `N₂` is very stable and would not react. `N₂O` (nitrous oxide) will decompose on hot copper in the reaction: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of `NH₄NO₃`, `n` moles of `N₂O` are produced.\n    *   Each mole of `N₂O` contains one mole of oxygen atoms. Thus, `n` moles of `N₂O` provide `n` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   From step 1, we know 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 0.05` mol. This result is consistent with the value of `n` we calculated from the amount of water.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** Gas C is what's left after Tube 3. The gases entering Tube 3 are `N₂` and `N₂O`.\n    *   `N₂` from `NH₄NO₂` decomposition: `n` moles.\n    *   `N₂O` from `NH₄NO₃` decomposition: `n` moles. This reacts completely to form `N₂` gas: `N₂O → N₂ + [O]`.\n    *   So, the total moles of `N₂` (Gas C) exiting Tube 3 is the initial `n` moles plus the `n` moles from the `N₂O` reaction.\n    *   Total moles of Gas C = `n + n = 2n`.\n    *   Using `n = 0.05` mol, the moles of Gas C = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10` mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C we calculated from the volume in step 1.\n\n**4. Check the Initial Mass**\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all products. Let's check if the initial mass is also correct.\n\n*   Salt A: `NH₄NO₂` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B: `NH₄NO₃` (Molar Mass ≈ 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n*   Total mass = `(0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)`\n*   Total mass = `3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g`.\nThis matches the given initial weight. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing only a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the effect on each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass did not change, which means no such acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) trapped by Cu = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The source of this oxygen could be O₂ gas (reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or an oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide, N₂O (reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). Both scenarios involve 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms being transferred.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas passed through all tubes unreacted, it must be inert. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of the Salts**\n\nLet's work backward from the products to identify the original salts.\nThe decomposition produced H, N, and O atoms. This means salts A and B must be compounds containing these elements. The fact that they decompose completely into gases suggests they might be ammonium salts.\n\nLet's consider two plausible chemical scenarios for the decomposition. Both lead to the same answer.\n\n**Scenario A (Decomposition to N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is O₂.\n*   Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol, so moles of O₂ molecules = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   The gas mixture produced was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n*   The molar ratio of products is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20. Dividing by 0.025 gives a simple integer ratio of **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\n**Scenario B (Decomposition to N₂, N₂O, H₂O - Chemically more likely at 200°C):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is N₂O.\n*   The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To trap 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of the N₂ from this reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was initially produced and passed through Tube 3 unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the original gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n**3. Test the Hypothesized Salts**\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** fits our data.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet the equimolar amount of each salt in the initial mixture be 'n' moles.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n moles\n*   Total N₂O = n moles\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nNow, we match this with the products derived in Scenario B:\n*   Total N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results match perfectly. Thus, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass matches the value given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n**1. Identify the products and their quantities:**\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Reacts with oxygen (O₂) via 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at STP. This gas did not react with the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total mass of the products is 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (O₂) + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol N₂) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This equals the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming that Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the salts A and B:**\nThe decomposition produces H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\nLet's consider the decomposition of two such salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet the mixture contain *n* moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and *n* moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃) since it is an equimolar mixture.\n\n**3. Set up stoichiometric equations:**\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₂, we get: *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₃, we get: *n* mol N₂ (from 0.5*n* of the 2-mol reaction), 0.5*n* mol O₂, and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2*n + 2*n = 4*n\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0 + 0.5*n = 0.5*n\n*   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2*n\n\n**4. Solve for *n*:**\nWe can use any of the product quantities to find *n*. Using oxygen is the most direct:\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5*n = 0.025 mol\n*   *n* = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol\n\nLet's verify this value of *n* with the other products:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = 2*n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4*n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n\nThe identities of the salts are confirmed as **NH₄NO₂** (Salt A) and **NH₄NO₃** (Salt B).\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\nThe question asks for the sum of the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Separation Process:**\n    *   The mixture of gases is passed through three tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, there were no acidic gases in the mixture. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have combined with the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   The total initial mass of salts was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert to the reagents used and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). So, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain only the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Salts that decompose upon heating to produce only these gases are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Decomposition reactions:**\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**. Let's say we have 'n' moles of A (NH₄NO₂) and 'n' moles of B (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   According to the stoichiometry of the reactions:\n        *   'n' mol NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n        *   'n' mol NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O (halving the second reaction's coefficients).\n    *   **Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = `2n` mol.\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = `0.5n` mol.\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = `4n` mol.\n    *   Now, we compare these expressions with our experimental results:\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025` ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Let's use `n = 0.05` to check the amounts of the other products:\n        *   Predicted Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol.

The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Final Mass Check:**\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) = 14×2 + 1×4 + 16×2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = 14×2 + 1×4 + 16×3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial weight of the mixture perfectly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium nitrite):** Formula is NH₄NO₂, which can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium nitrate):** Formula is NH₄NO₃, which can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem is solved by analyzing the products of the decomposition to identify the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition was passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes were recorded.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is due to the oxygen consumed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and the Original Elements**\n\n*   By the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas that is unreactive under these conditions with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determination of the Empirical Formula and Identity of the Salts**\n\n*   Since the products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, the original salts A and B must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = 0.2 + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol.\n*   The molar ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B (as they are an equimolar mixture) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   Given that these are salts formed from N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions. The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining part, for the anions, is N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   Two common anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the salts are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n**4. Verification**\nLet's check the decomposition reactions.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   At 200°C, a relevant decomposition for ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   The python code execution confirms that a mixture of 0.05 mol of each salt has a total mass of 7.20 g. Let's check the products from these amounts:\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Total products:** 0.1 mol N₂, 0.2 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂. This perfectly matches our initial calculations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass gain is from oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must come from an oxidizing gas in the mixture. Two main scenarios are possible:\n        *   **Scenario A:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n        *   **Scenario B:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.05 mol of N₂O gas. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of gas C at standard temperature and pressure (STP) remained.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nLet's evaluate both scenarios to see if they are consistent.\n\n*   **Scenario A:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (2 × n(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly.\n\n*   **Scenario B:** The products are 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O. The 0.1 mol of remaining gas is N₂. However, the reduction of N₂O also produces N₂. The total N₂ (0.1 mol) is the sum of the N₂ initially present and the N₂ produced from N₂O.\n    *   n(N₂ from N₂O) = n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    *   n(N₂ initial) = Total n(N₂) - n(N₂ from N₂O) = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the decomposition products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × n(N₂O)) + (2 × n(N₂)) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (1 × n(H₂O)) + (1 × n(N₂O)) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   This yields the exact same elemental composition as Scenario A, which also sums to 7.20 g.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the data and lead to the same conclusion: the 7.20 g mixture contains **0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O, and decompose fully into gases. This strongly points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A common high-temperature decomposition of ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let's assume we have *n* moles of each salt.\nIf A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃:\n*   *n* NH₄NO₂ produces *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   *n* NH₄NO₃ produces *n* mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + 2*n* mol H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio).\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow we match this with our findings from Scenario A: n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(O₂) = 0.025 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol.\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.025  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   Check N₂: Total N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches)\n*   Check H₂O: Total H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (Matches)\n\nThe identification is correct. We have an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms in the salts.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Products**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the mass change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing carbon (carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is from the oxygen.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of O₂ produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After the other gases were removed, a final gas C remained.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of Gas C**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass**\n\nThe elements in the products (H, O, and the element(s) in Gas C) must have come from the original salts A and B. Since no acidic gases were formed, the most likely candidate for a stable, unreactive gas produced from a salt is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the mass is conserved:\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass of the mixture. Our product identification is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. These are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common ones are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's check their decomposition reactions.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate at ~200°C: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)**\n\nThis matches our observed products: N₂, H₂O, and O₂.\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ we get: `n` moles of N₂, `2n` moles of H₂O, and `0.5n` moles of O₂.\n\nNow, let's sum the products and compare them to our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ produced = `0.5n`. We measured 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025 mol`, which gives **`n = 0.05` mol**.\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `n` (from nitrite) + `n` (from nitrate) = `2n` = 2 × 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Total H₂O = `2n` (from nitrite) + `2n` (from nitrate) = `4n` = 4 × 0.05 = **0.20 mol**. This also matches.\n\nThe salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    The problem describes the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant (drying agent). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a limewater test. A milky precipitate (CaCO₃) would form if acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present. Since the weight did not change, no such gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen consumed.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   Wait, the reaction shows the mass increase is the mass of O₂, not just O. Let's re-examine. `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The tube contains copper initially. The mass *increase* is the mass of the other reactant, which is O₂.\n        *   Okay, wait. Let's think carefully. If we have a tube of copper, and we pass O₂ through it, the copper turns into CuO. The mass of the *tube's contents* increases. The increase is the mass of the oxygen that has become part of the solid CuO. So the 0.80 g increase is the mass of atomic oxygen, not diatomic oxygen gas.\n        *   Let's check the wording again: \"the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3)\". This phrasing usually means the mass of the absorbed/reacted substance. For red-hot copper, it reacts with O₂ gas. The mass increase of the *copper* itself is the mass of oxygen atoms. So, mass of O is 0.80g.\n            *   Moles of O from this source = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This came from O₂ gas, so Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol. This is consistent.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the first three steps, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the elements likely present (H, O from H₂O and O₂), and the fact that we're dealing with decomposing salts, a very common inert gaseous product is Nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Original Salts:**\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.4 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol × 14.01 g/mol ≈ 2.8 g.\n\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the produced H₂O and from the O that reacted with copper (which came from O₂ gas).\n        *   Moles of O from H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol.\n        *   Moles of O that reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n3.  **Verify the Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n    *   **Find the Salt Formulas:** We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n        *   The overall ratio of atoms in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\n        *   To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the total atoms from one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B. We are looking for two common salts made of H, N, and O that add up to this composition.\n    *   These salts are typically ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's consider Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₂ is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n        *   Chemical formula of NH₄NO₃ is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their atoms matches our ratio:\n        *   Total H = 4 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 4 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 8. (Matches)\n        *   Total N = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 2 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 4. (Matches)\n        *   Total O = 2 (from N₂H₄O₂) + 3 (from N₂H₄O₃) = 5. (Matches)\n    *   The identification is successful. Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula unit of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed previously confirmed this calculation by taking the same logical steps and computing the total atoms from the identified formulas (N₂H₄O₂ and N₂H₄O₃). The output `17` is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\n    The mixture of gases from the heated salts is passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify the components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. Therefore, the mass of O₂ gas produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that does not react in any of the tubes remains. We have 2.24 L of this gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each product.**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.00 g/mol.\n        Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C:**\n        At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas C.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Total mass = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass (C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂), since the molar mass of N is ~14 g/mol (2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol).\n\n4.  **Determine the total elemental composition of the salts.**\n    The salts A and B must contain all the atoms found in the products (H, O, N), as nothing else was added.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n5.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The initial mixture contained an equimolar amount of salt A and salt B. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. The total atomic composition we found above (0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, 0.25 mol O) is distributed between `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\n    Let's find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A + B).\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\n    So, the combination of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must contain a total of 8 H atoms, 4 N atoms, and 5 O atoms.\n\n    The salts are formed from H, N, and O. Common salts of this type are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Let's see if we can construct the salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), which contains 1 N and 4 H.\n    *   Our total H atom count is 8. This corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × 4 H = 8 H).\n    *   This implies that each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion:\n        *   Salt A = NH₄(Anion_A)\n        *   Salt B = NH₄(Anion_B)\n    *   Now let's account for the remaining atoms. We have used 2 N atoms and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Remaining N atoms = 4 (total) - 2 (in NH₄⁺ ions) = 2 N atoms.\n        *   Remaining O atoms = 5 (total) - 0 = 5 O atoms.\n    *   These remaining 2 N and 5 O atoms must make up the two anions (Anion_A and Anion_B). Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit:\n        *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻) has 1 N and 2 O.\n        *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻) has 1 N and 3 O.\n    *   Total atoms from these two anions: (1+1) N and (2+3) O = 2 N and 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their formula units).\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nFinal check of the mass:\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 64.05 g/mol\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 80.05 g/mol\nLet's find the number of moles `n` from the product data. Based on the decomposition 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or 1 NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O), the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, where 0.5*n = 0.025, so n = 0.05 moles.\nLet's check the mass with n = 0.05 mol:\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol × (64.05 g/mol) + 0.05 mol × (80.05 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms our calculations.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
