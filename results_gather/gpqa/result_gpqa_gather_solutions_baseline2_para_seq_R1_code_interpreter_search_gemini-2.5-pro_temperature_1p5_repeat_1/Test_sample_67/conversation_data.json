Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin angular momentum `S` has a z-component `Sz` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the particle in this field is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S ⋅ B_initial) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The energy for spin up (`|+z>`) is `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   The energy for spin down (`|-z>`) is `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field along the Z-axis is turned off, and a new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian: `H' = -μ ⋅ B_final = -γ(S ⋅ B_final) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation of the *average* (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)>`. This can be found in two ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThis is the most direct method. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d<S>/dt = γ * <S> x B`\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the vector `<S>` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω_L = γ * |B|`\n*   In our case, the new field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   **Initial Spin Vector:** At `t=0`, the state is `|+z>`. The expectation value of the spin vector is `<S(0)> = <+z|S|+z>`.\n    *   `<Sx(0)> = <+z|Sx|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sy(0)> = <+z|Sy|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sz(0)> = <+z|Sz|+z> = ħ/2`\n    *   So, initially, `<S(0)> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`. The spin vector points along the Z-axis.\n*   **Precession:** For `t>0`, the spin vector `<S(t)>` precesses around the new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ`. This means `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   **Z-Component Oscillation:** As the vector `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate. The frequency of this rotation is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   Therefore, `<Sz(t)>` oscillates as `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\n\n1.  **Express Initial State in New Basis:** The new Hamiltonian `H'` is proportional to `Sy`. We need to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of `Sy`. The eigenstates of `Sy` are:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    Inverting these gives:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    So, `|ψ(t=0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H'`, this is straightforward.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for `H' = -γB*Sy` are `E'_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` for `|+y>` and `E'_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)` for `|-y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE'_+t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE'_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Expectation Value `<Sz(t)>`:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `|+y>` and `|-y>` back into `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>` (After simplification, as shown in the thought process).\n    *   Now calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Using `Sz|±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>` and the orthogonality of the states:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Find Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The term oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field **B₀** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The interaction Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B₀** = -γS_z B.\n*   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin-up) and -ħ/2 (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are E = -γ(±ħ/2)B. Assuming γ > 0, the lower energy state corresponds to S_z = +ħ/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n*   At t=0, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution for t ≥ 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n*   The state of the particle at a later time t is given by the Schrödinger equation: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting H', we get:\n    U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(i(γBt)S_y / ħ)\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, ω = γB. The evolution operator becomes:\n    U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (σ) by **S** = (ħ/2)**σ**. So, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    U(t) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)\n*   We can use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: exp(iaσ_k) = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k.\n    Here, a = ωt/2 and k = y.\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y\n*   In the S_z basis, σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] and I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n*   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n*   The operator S_z in matrix form is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n*   Let's compute ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * ( (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] ) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)\n*   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of such an oscillation is A*cos(Ωt + φ), where Ω is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)` with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is Ω = ω.\n*   Since we defined ω = γB, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n### Alternative Method: Bohr Frequency\nThe system starts in the state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. The new Hamiltonian is H' = -γBS_y. We can express the initial state as a superposition of the eigenstates of H'. The eigenstates of S_y are |↑⟩_y and |↓⟩_y, with corresponding energy eigenvalues E_↑_y = -γBħ/2 and E_↓_y = +γBħ/2.\n\nThe initial state in this new basis is:\n|↑⟩_z = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_y + |↓⟩_y)\n\nThe state evolves as:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iE_↑_y t/ħ) |↑⟩_y + e^(-iE_↓_y t/ħ) |↓⟩_y ]\n\nAn observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate at the Bohr frequency, ω_Bohr = ΔE/ħ, where ΔE is the energy difference between the populated states.\nΔE = E_↓_y - E_↑_y = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ\nω_Bohr = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is γB, which is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user's code failed because the `sympy` library's `JzKet` function is strict about its input types. It expects integers or symbolic fractions (like `sympy.S(1)/2`) for the quantum numbers, not floating-point numbers like `0.5`. This is a common issue with symbolic math libraries that need to maintain precision and symbolic integrity.\n\nHowever, the physical reasoning laid out before and within the code comments is correct. Let's re-iterate the logical steps without relying on the code execution, as the derivation is standard in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** At time t < 0, the magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along +Z). The magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is aligned with the field, meaning the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γBS_z. The energy levels are E = -γB(m_sħ), where m_s = ±1/2. The lowest energy state corresponds to the highest m_s, which is m_s = +1/2 (assuming γ>0, which is standard). Thus, the initial state at t=0 is the spin-up state along Z, |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (ħ/2) **k̂**.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:** For t > 0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along +Y). The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession):** A magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin is d⟨**S**⟩/dt = ⟨**μ**⟩ × **B'** = (γ⟨**S**⟩) × **B'**. This describes a precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the **B'** field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency vector **ω** = -γ**B'**. The magnitude of this angular frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω_L = |γB|.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of S_z:**\n    *   At t=0, the spin vector points along the +Z axis: ⟨**S**⟩(0) = (0, 0, ħ/2).\n    *   For t>0, this vector precesses around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane with angular frequency ω = γB.\n    *   The angle of rotation at time t is θ = ωt = γBt.\n    *   Using standard rotation of coordinates, the Z-component of the vector at time t will be the initial Z-component projected onto the new Z-axis after rotation.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(θ) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt). This is a value that oscillates in time according to the function cos(γBt). A function of the form cos(ωt) has an angular frequency of ω.\n\n    By comparison, the oscillation frequency is ω = γB.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (at t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * B * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lower energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * B * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ * ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Let's calculate `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n5.  **Method 1: Larmor Precession**\n    *   A classical and semi-classical approach involves the Larmor precession equation for the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`:\n        `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ * (⟨S⟩ × B)`\n    *   Here, `B = (0, B, 0)`. The equation becomes:\n        `d/dt (⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩, ⟨S_z⟩) = γ * (⟨S_y⟩*0 - ⟨S_z⟩*B, ⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*0, ⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0)`\n    *   This gives a set of coupled differential equations:\n        1.  `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩`\n        2.  `d⟨S_y⟩/dt = 0`\n        3.  `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩`\n    *   To find the oscillation of `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate equation (3) with respect to time:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt`\n    *   Now substitute equation (1) into this:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to evaluate `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/ħ)(ħ/2)σ_y) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   The initial state is `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|+z⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we calculate the expectation value `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`. The `S_z` operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine function of time.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The magnetic field is initially **B** = B**k̂** (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means its magnetic moment **μ** points in the same direction as **B**, i.e., in the +Z direction. For this to happen, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩, must be positive.\n*   Since μ_z = γS_z, we need ⟨γS_z⟩ > 0.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   Let's assume γ is positive (like for a proton). Then we need ⟨S_z⟩ to be positive. This means the particle must be in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. This state is commonly denoted as \"spin-up\" or |↑⟩_z.\n*   So, the initial state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard basis where |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ and |↓⟩_z = [0, 1]ᵀ, this is simply the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n*   The S_y operator in the S_z basis is given by S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n*   So, H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n### 3. Time Evolution\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Evolving the state vector)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian H'.**\n    The eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. They are:\n    *   |↑⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ (eigenvalue +ħ/2)\n    *   |↓⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ (eigenvalue -ħ/2)\n\n    We express our initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n    |↑⟩_z = (1/√2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2)|↓⟩_y.\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    Let ω = γB. This is the Larmor frequency. The energy eigenvalues of H' are E_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓(ħω/2).\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|↓⟩_y\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iωt/2)|↓⟩_y\n\n3.  **Convert back to the S_z basis to calculate ⟨S_z⟩.**\n    Using |↑⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z) and |↓⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z), we substitute back into |ψ(t)⟩. After simplification using Euler's formulas (cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2, sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i), we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n    With S_z|↑⟩_z = +(ħ/2)|↑⟩_z and S_z|↓⟩_z = -(ħ/2)|↓⟩_z, we find:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (cos(ωt/2) * ⟨↑|_z - sin(ωt/2) * ⟨↓|_z) * S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt).\n    Substituting ω = γB, we have:\n    ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)\n\n    The function oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine, which is **γB**.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ obeys the classical torque equation:\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ⟨**S**⟩ × **B'**\n\nIn our case, **B'** is along the y-axis, so **B'** = (0, B, 0).\nThe components of the equation are:\n*   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_y⟩B - ⟨S_z⟩*0) = -γB⟨S_z⟩ (using right-hand rule for cross product, not just magnitudes)\n*   d⟨S_y⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*B) = 0\n*   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0) = γB⟨S_x⟩\n\nThis describes the precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the Y-axis. To find the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩, we can solve this system.\nTake the time derivative of the third equation:\nd²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt\n\nSubstitute the first equation into this:\nd²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency ω is **γB**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is described by the spin operator $\\vec{S} = (S_x, S_y, S_z)$. The magnetic moment is given by $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{init} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma B S_z$.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-up state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$) and $-\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-down state $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$).\n    *   The energies are $E = -\\gamma B (\\pm \\hbar/2)$. To minimize the energy (assuming $\\gamma$ and $B$ are positive, which is standard), we must maximize the eigenvalue of $S_z$. Thus, the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. The expectation value of the spin is purely in the z-direction: $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle_0 = \\langle\\uparrow|_z \\vec{S} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Dynamics after the Change:**\n    *   At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B\\hat{y}$.\n    *   For $t > 0$, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector is given by the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    *   $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)|S_z|\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$. There are a few ways to do this.\n\n    **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical approach)**\n    *   The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector is $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\langle\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new} = \\gamma \\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new}$.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the magnetic field axis ($\\hat{y}$) with an angular frequency $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   The initial spin vector is $\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$. This vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis.\n    *   The z-component of the precessing vector is given by $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = |\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle| \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is then $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expression for $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is a cosine function of time. The argument of the cosine is $\\omega t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   Therefore, the angular oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n    **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to compute $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. Let $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. The time evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{i\\omega_L t S_y/\\hbar}$.\n    *   The operator $e^{i\\theta S_y/\\hbar}$ represents a rotation about the y-axis by an angle $\\theta$. Here, $\\theta = \\omega_L t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   We are rotating the initial state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ around the y-axis. In terms of state vectors:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z$.\n        (Note: The angle in the spinor rotation formula is half the angle of the vector rotation).\n    *   Now, we compute the expectation value:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) S_z \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Since $S_z|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ and $S_z|\\downarrow\\rangle_z = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$, this becomes:\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the spin states ($\\langle\\uparrow|\\uparrow\\rangle = 1$, $\\langle\\downarrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=1$, $\\langle\\uparrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=0$), we get:\n        $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\right)$\n    *   Using the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   This gives the same result as the Larmor precession method. The average of the z-component of the moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates as $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.

Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_i = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    The energy levels are `E = -γ * m_s * ħ * B`, where `m_s = ±1/2` are the spin quantum numbers.\n    \"Aligned with the field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest possible value of `m_s`, which is `m_s = +1/2`. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian for t > 0.**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_y`. The magnitude `B` remains the same. The new Hamiltonian `H_f` that governs the time evolution for `t>0` is:\n    `H_f = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n    The spin operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H_f = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution of the state.**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)⟩`.\n    Let's evaluate the time evolution operator `U(t)`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (γ * B * t / 2) * σ_y)`.\n    Let `θ = γ * B * t / 2`. The operator is `exp(i * θ * σ_y)`.\n    Using the property of Pauli matrices that `σ_y^2 = I` (the identity matrix), we can expand the exponential using its Taylor series, which simplifies to:\n    `exp(i * θ * σ_y) = I * cos(θ) + i * σ_y * sin(θ)`.\n    Substituting the matrices for `I` and `σ_y`:\n    `U(t) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] * cos(γBt/2) + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(γBt/2)`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment operator is `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    The expectation value `<μ_z>` at time `t` is given by `<ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    First, let's find `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`, which is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`.\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    Now, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expression for the average of the z-component of the moment is `<μ_z>(t) = A * cos(ωt)`, where the amplitude is `A = γħ/2` and the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a 2D complex vector (a spinor).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The notation `mu (= gamma*Sz)` is a common shorthand, implying the relationship is vectorial, `μ = γS`. If we interpreted it literally, the problem would lead to a non-oscillating result, which contradicts the question's premise.\n*   **Initial Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is `B_initial = (0, 0, B)`. The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n    *   `H_initial = -γS · B_initial = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>` -> Energy `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>` -> Energy `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   The lower energy state is `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   **New Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γS · (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The system's state `|ψ(t)>` will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(iγB S_y t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator describes a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis. The angle of rotation is `θ(t) = -γBt`. The precession of the spin has begun.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. To find `<S_z(t)>`, we calculate `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are several ways to do this. A very direct method relies on the energy difference in the new system.\n\n**Method: Using Energy Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   `S_y |+y> = +(ħ/2) |+y>` -> Energy `E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>` -> Energy `E_{-y} = +γB(ħ/2)`\n\n2.  We express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the new energy eigenstates:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) |+y> + (1/√2) |-y>`\n\n3.  The state at time `t` is the time-evolved superposition:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(-iE_{+y} t/ħ) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iE_{-y} t/ħ) |-y>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n\n4.  The expectation value of an observable `A` in such a superposition will oscillate at a frequency `ω` determined by the energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y}`.\n    *   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n5.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis angular frequency `ω` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's confirm this by completing the full calculation for `<S_z(t)>`:\nFirst, express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\nThen, calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\nUsing the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe time-dependent part is `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B = - (gamma * Sz) * B`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in the lower energy state, which for a spin-1/2 particle is the `spin-up` state along Z.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenvector of `Sz` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**:\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B`\n    Here, `mu` is the magnetic moment vector operator, `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin vector operator `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n    The new magnetic field is `B = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    `H = - (gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Larmor Precession**:\n    The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -gamma * B * Sy`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This time evolution corresponds to the precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Equations of Motion (Heisenberg Picture)**:\n    A clear way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin components using the Ehrenfest theorem, which leads to the classical equation of motion for the expectation values:\n    `d<S>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[S, H]>`\n    Substituting `H = -gamma * B * Sy`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sz, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sz, Sy]>`\n\n    Using the commutation relation for spin operators, `[Si, Sj] = iħ * ε_ijk * Sk`, we find:\n    `[Sz, Sy] = iħ * ε_zyx * Sx = iħ * (-1) * Sx = -iħ * Sx`\n\n    Substituting this back into the equation for `d<Sz>/dt`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (-iħ * <Sx>) = gamma * B * <Sx>` (Equation 1)\n\n    Similarly, we find the equation for `d<Sx>/dt`:\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sx, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sx, Sy]>`\n    The commutation relation is `[Sx, Sy] = iħ * Sz`.\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (iħ * <Sz>) = -gamma * B * <Sz>` (Equation 2)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    We now have a pair of coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `<Sz(t)>`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * d<Sx>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * (-gamma * B * <Sz>)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = -(gamma * B)² * <Sz>`\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    `ω² = (gamma * B)²`\n    `ω = gamma * B`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <Sz(t)>`. Since `<Sz(t)>` oscillates with angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`, `<mu_z(t)>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (i.e., point in the `+Z` direction), the system must be in the state with the lowest energy. The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. For `⟨μ_z⟩` to be positive (aligned with `+Z`), we need `γ⟨S_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z⟩` (`E_up` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = +ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ < 0`, the lowest energy state is `|-z⟩` (`E_down` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = -ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state is an eigenstate of `S_z`. Let's assume the initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency is independent of this choice.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden approximation\" means the state of the particle does not have time to change. So, at `t=0+`, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Substituting `|ψ(t)⟩`, we get:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\nThis is a classic example of Larmor precession. The evolution of the expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`. This describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nLet's calculate this quantum mechanically. The expression `exp(-iθn⋅S/ħ) S_k exp(iθn⋅S/ħ)` represents a rotation of the operator `S_k` around the axis `n` by an angle `θ`.\n\n*   Here, the rotation axis `n` is the Y-axis.\n*   The rotation angle is `θ = γBt`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is rotated around the Y-axis. The rotated operator `S_z(t)` is:\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ)`.\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n\nNow, we compute the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z(t) |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt) |+z⟩`.\n*   This splits into two terms: `cos(γBt)⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩`.\n\nWe need the expectation values of `S_z` and `S_x` in the state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ = ħ/2` (since `|+z⟩` is an eigenstate of `S_z`).\n*   `⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩ = 0` (The expectation value of `S_x` in an eigenstate of `S_z` is zero).\n\nPlugging these values back:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt) - 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` shows that it oscillates sinusoidally with time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is the Larmor frequency. If we had chosen the initial state to be `|-z⟩`, the result would have been `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = -γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, which has the same oscillation frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analytical step-by-step derivation is provided to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, **μ** = γ**S**, is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, **B** = B **k̂**. The Hamiltonian for this situation is H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S_z. Alignment with the field means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n    *   The operator S_z has two eigenstates: spin-up |+z⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down |-z⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio γ is positive (as is common for the intrinsic spin of particles like the electron, though γ_e is negative, the \"γ\" in these problems is often treated as a positive constant), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_up.\n    *   Thus, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis: |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):**\n    Suddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B **ĵ**. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t>0 is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB S_y.\n    *   In the S_z basis, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ħ/2):\n        S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   So, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -γB(ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   U(t) = exp[-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ] = exp[iγBt S_y/ħ]\n    *   Substituting S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, we get: U(t) = exp[iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y].\n    *   Using the mathematical identity for Pauli matrices, exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix and θ = γBt/2.\n    *   U(t) = I*cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y*sin(γBt/2) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` * `[1, 0]ᵀ` = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   In bracket notation, the state at time t is: |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨γS_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   The operator S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt).\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt) describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is A*cos(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing our result with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of the oscillation is ω = γB.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and ω = γB is the Larmor frequency.

The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `U = -μ · B`. To be aligned, the moment must be in the lowest energy state.\n    *   The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = - (γ * S_z) * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. (Note: even if we assume `γ < 0`, the resulting oscillation frequency remains the same, as shown in the detailed calculation below).\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (`t = 0`):**\n    *   The magnetic field in the Z direction is switched off.\n    *   A new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is switched on in the +Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (`t > 0`):**\n    *   The system now evolves under a new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γ * S_vec) · (B * ŷ) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is governed by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z>(t)` and multiplying by `γ`. So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   This is a classic problem of Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S_vec>` will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency:**\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`.\n    *   As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis (and also the X-axis) will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`, and consequently `<μ_z>(t)`, is `ω = |γB|`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive constants as is typical in such problems, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Formal Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Optional but confirms the result):**\n    We can solve this formally using the matrix representation of spin operators (Pauli matrices).\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   Initial state `|+z>` is the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_n`, with `θ = γBt/2`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we compute `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation described by `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the conceptual understanding of Larmor precession and the detailed quantum mechanical calculation give the same result.

The Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the field\". This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to spin-up along Z.\n*   The initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, denoted as `|+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]`.\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ = [1, 0]`\n\n### 2. Dynamics for t > 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is applied in the `+Y` direction.\n*   The change is \"sudden,\" which means the state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change. Thus, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_f = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ(S ⋅ Bŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The Hamiltonian simplifies to `H_f = -ω S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iH_f t / ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\nSubstituting `H_f`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-ωS_y)t / ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iωtS_y / ħ) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the exponential of the `S_y` operator, we use its matrix form `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n`exp(iωtS_y / ħ) = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`\n\nUsing the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`:\n`exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y`\n`= cos(ωt/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin(ωt/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n`= [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\nNow, we apply this evolution operator to our initial state:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\nUsing the matrix for `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`:\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0],[0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n\nUsing the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for the average z-component of the moment is `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`. This value oscillates in time according to the function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\nWe defined the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nThis physical phenomenon is called Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, which initially points along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle. The magnetic moment is given by the operator `vec(mu) = gamma * vec(S)`, where `vec(S)` is the spin operator and `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` along the +Z direction and is \"aligned with\" it. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_initial = -vec(mu) . vec(B) = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, 0, B) = -gamma * B * Sz`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sz` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+hbar/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-hbar/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -gamma * B * (eigenvalue of Sz)`.\n*   So, `E_up = -gamma*B*hbar/2` and `E_down = gamma*B*hbar/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state (assuming `gamma*B > 0`) is the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new field is `vec(B') = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t >= 0` is `H = -vec(mu) . vec(B') = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, B, 0) = -gamma * B * Sy`.\n*   The state of the particle will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian `H`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe oscillation frequency of an expectation value in a quantum system is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H`.**\n    The Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator `Sy`. So, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we can call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+hbar/2` and `-hbar/2`.\n    The energy eigenvalues are:\n    *   `E_+` (corresponding to `|+y>` state): `E_+ = -gamma * B * (+hbar/2) = - (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n    *   `E_-` (corresponding to `|-y>` state): `E_- = -gamma * B * (-hbar/2) = + (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Express the initial state in the basis of the new energy eigenstates.**\n    The initial state is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`. We need to express this in the `Sy` eigenbasis. The `Sy` eigenstates are related to the `Sz` eigenstates as follows:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> + i*|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> - i*|-z>)`\n    By adding these two equations, we get `|+y> + |-y> = sqrt(2) * |+z>`, which means:\n    `|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    This shows that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Relate the energy difference to the oscillation frequency.**\n    When a system is in a superposition of two energy states with energies `E_a` and `E_b`, any observable that connects these two states will have an expectation value that oscillates with an angular frequency `omega` given by:\n    `omega = |E_a - E_b| / hbar`\n    In our case, the two populated states have energies `E_+` and `E_-`. The energy difference is:\n    `Delta E = E_- - E_+ = [(gamma * B * hbar) / 2] - [- (gamma * B * hbar) / 2] = gamma * B * hbar`\n    The oscillation frequency `omega` is therefore:\n    `omega = Delta E / hbar = (gamma * B * hbar) / hbar = gamma * B`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * <Sz>(t)`, will oscillate. This oscillation arises from the coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, determined by the energy splitting caused by the new magnetic field.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis corresponds to the classical picture of Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses about the magnetic field axis (`Y`-axis in this case) with an angular frequency of `gamma * B`. The `z`-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as the cosine of this precessing angle.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Physics Problem**: The core of the problem involves a spin-1/2 particle initially in its lowest energy state (spin-up, aligned with a magnetic field along +Z). This field is then suddenly switched to the +Y direction. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of its magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: This scenario is a classic example of **Larmor precession**. A magnetic moment `μ` (or its associated spin `S`) in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque that causes its expectation value `⟨S⟩` to precess around the direction of `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is called the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Larmor Frequency**: The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. In this problem, the new magnetic field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Motion**:\n    *   The initial spin expectation value `⟨S(0)⟩` points along the +Z axis.\n    *   The new magnetic field `B` points along the +Y axis.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `⟨S⟩` will precess around the Y-axis.\n    *   As this vector rotates in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `⟨S_z(t)⟩`, will oscillate.\n    *   The frequency of this oscillation is identical to the precession frequency. Thus, the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`—and by extension, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` since `μ_z = γS_z`—is `ω = γB`.\n\n5.  **Review the Candidate Answers' Reasoning**:\n    *   A vast majority of the provided answers (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) correctly identify the physics.\n    *   They employ several valid methods to prove the result:\n        *   **Heisenberg Picture**: Solving the operator equations of motion `d<S_k>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_k, H]>`, which yields a simple harmonic oscillator equation for `⟨S_z⟩` with frequency `ω = γB` (e.g., Answers 5, 10).\n        *   **Schrödinger Picture**: Expressing the initial state `|+z⟩` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (`-γBS_y`), applying the time evolution operator, and calculating `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. This results in a term proportional to `cos(γBt)` (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 8, 12, 14).\n        *   **Bohr Frequency**: Noting that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequency is then `ω = ΔE/ħ`, which again yields `ω = γB` (e.g., Answers 2, 9, 15).\n        *   **Larmor Precession Concept**: Directly applying the concept of Larmor precession (e.g., Answers 1, 7, 13).\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: All correct physical derivations unanimously conclude that the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. The disagreements in the final letter choices (e.g., `<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, `<<<D>>>`) seem to arise from inconsistent ordering of the options presented to each candidate.

Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin angular momentum `S` has a z-component `Sz` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the particle in this field is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S ⋅ B_initial) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The energy for spin up (`|+z>`) is `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   The energy for spin down (`|-z>`) is `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field along the Z-axis is turned off, and a new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian: `H' = -μ ⋅ B_final = -γ(S ⋅ B_final) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation of the *average* (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)>`. This can be found in two ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThis is the most direct method. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d<S>/dt = γ * <S> x B`\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the vector `<S>` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω_L = γ * |B|`\n*   In our case, the new field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   **Initial Spin Vector:** At `t=0`, the state is `|+z>`. The expectation value of the spin vector is `<S(0)> = <+z|S|+z>`.\n    *   `<Sx(0)> = <+z|Sx|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sy(0)> = <+z|Sy|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sz(0)> = <+z|Sz|+z> = ħ/2`\n    *   So, initially, `<S(0)> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`. The spin vector points along the Z-axis.\n*   **Precession:** For `t>0`, the spin vector `<S(t)>` precesses around the new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ`. This means `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   **Z-Component Oscillation:** As the vector `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate. The frequency of this rotation is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   Therefore, `<Sz(t)>` oscillates as `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\n\n1.  **Express Initial State in New Basis:** The new Hamiltonian `H'` is proportional to `Sy`. We need to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of `Sy`. The eigenstates of `Sy` are:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    Inverting these gives:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    So, `|ψ(t=0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H'`, this is straightforward.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for `H' = -γB*Sy` are `E'_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` for `|+y>` and `E'_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)` for `|-y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE'_+t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE'_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Expectation Value `<Sz(t)>`:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `|+y>` and `|-y>` back into `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>` (After simplification, as shown in the thought process).\n    *   Now calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Using `Sz|±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>` and the orthogonality of the states:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Find Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The term oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field **B₀** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The interaction Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B₀** = -γS_z B.\n*   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin-up) and -ħ/2 (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are E = -γ(±ħ/2)B. Assuming γ > 0, the lower energy state corresponds to S_z = +ħ/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n*   At t=0, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution for t ≥ 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n*   The state of the particle at a later time t is given by the Schrödinger equation: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting H', we get:\n    U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(i(γBt)S_y / ħ)\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, ω = γB. The evolution operator becomes:\n    U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (σ) by **S** = (ħ/2)**σ**. So, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    U(t) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)\n*   We can use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: exp(iaσ_k) = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k.\n    Here, a = ωt/2 and k = y.\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y\n*   In the S_z basis, σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] and I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n*   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n*   The operator S_z in matrix form is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n*   Let's compute ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * ( (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] ) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)\n*   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation.

It expects integers or symbolic fractions (like `sympy.S(1)/2`) for the quantum numbers, not floating-point numbers like `0.5`. This is a common issue with symbolic math libraries that need to maintain precision and symbolic integrity.\n\nHowever, the physical reasoning laid out before and within the code comments is correct. Let's re-iterate the logical steps without relying on the code execution, as the derivation is standard in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** At time t < 0, the magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along +Z). The magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is aligned with the field, meaning the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γBS_z. The energy levels are E = -γB(m_sħ), where m_s = ±1/2. The lowest energy state corresponds to the highest m_s, which is m_s = +1/2 (assuming γ>0, which is standard). Thus, the initial state at t=0 is the spin-up state along Z, |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (ħ/2) **k̂**.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:** For t > 0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along +Y). The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession):** A magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin is d⟨**S**⟩/dt = ⟨**μ**⟩ × **B'** = (γ⟨**S**⟩) × **B'**. This describes a precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the **B'** field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency vector **ω** = -γ**B'**. The magnitude of this angular frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω_L = |γB|.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of S_z:**\n    *   At t=0, the spin vector points along the +Z axis: ⟨**S**⟩(0) = (0, 0, ħ/2).\n    *   For t>0, this vector precesses around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane with angular frequency ω = γB.\n    *   The angle of rotation at time t is θ = ωt = γBt.\n    *   Using standard rotation of coordinates, the Z-component of the vector at time t will be the initial Z-component projected onto the new Z-axis after rotation.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(θ) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt). This is a value that oscillates in time according to the function cos(γBt). A function of the form cos(ωt) has an angular frequency of ω.\n\n    By comparison, the oscillation frequency is ω = γB.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (at t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * B * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lower energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * B * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ * ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Let's calculate `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n5.  **Method 1: Larmor Precession**\n    *   A classical and semi-classical approach involves the Larmor precession equation for the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`:\n        `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ * (⟨S⟩ × B)`\n    *   Here, `B = (0, B, 0)`. The equation becomes:\n        `d/dt (⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩, ⟨S_z⟩) = γ * (⟨S_y⟩*0 - ⟨S_z⟩*B, ⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*0, ⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0)`\n    *   This gives a set of coupled differential equations:\n        1.  `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩`\n        2.  `d⟨S_y⟩/dt = 0`\n        3.  `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩`\n    *   To find the oscillation of `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate equation (3) with respect to time:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt`\n    *   Now substitute equation (1) into this:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to evaluate `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/ħ)(ħ/2)σ_y) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   The initial state is `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|+z⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we calculate the expectation value `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`. The `S_z` operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine function of time. The general form is `A cos(ωt + φ)`. By inspection, the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth methods show that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The magnetic field is initially **B** = B**k̂** (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means its magnetic moment **μ** points in the same direction as **B**, i.e., in the +Z direction. For this to happen, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩, must be positive.\n*   Since μ_z = γS_z, we need ⟨γS_z⟩ > 0.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   Let's assume γ is positive (like for a proton). Then we need ⟨S_z⟩ to be positive. This means the particle must be in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. This state is commonly denoted as \"spin-up\" or |↑⟩_z.\n*   So, the initial state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard basis where |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ and |↓⟩_z = [0, 1]ᵀ, this is simply the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n*   The S_y operator in the S_z basis is given by S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n*   So, H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n### 3. Time Evolution\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Evolving the state vector)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian H'.**\n    The eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. They are:\n    *   |↑⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ (eigenvalue +ħ/2)\n    *   |↓⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ (eigenvalue -ħ/2)\n\n    We express our initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n    |↑⟩_z = (1/√2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2)|↓⟩_y.\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    Let ω = γB. This is the Larmor frequency. The energy eigenvalues of H' are E_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓(ħω/2).\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|↓⟩_y\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iωt/2)|↓⟩_y\n\n3.  **Convert back to the S_z basis to calculate ⟨S_z⟩.**\n    Using |↑⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z) and |↓⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z), we substitute back into |ψ(t)⟩. After simplification using Euler's formulas (cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2, sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i), we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n    With S_z|↑⟩_z = +(ħ/2)|↑⟩_z and S_z|↓⟩_z = -(ħ/2)|↓⟩_z, we find:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (cos(ωt/2) * ⟨↑|_z - sin(ωt/2) * ⟨↓|_z) * S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt).\n    Substituting ω = γB, we have:\n    ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)\n\n    The function oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine, which is **γB**.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ obeys the classical torque equation:\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ⟨**S**⟩ × **B'**\n\nIn our case, **B'** is along the y-axis, so **B'** = (0, B, 0).\nThe components of the equation are:\n*   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_y⟩B - ⟨S_z⟩*0) = -γB⟨S_z⟩ (using right-hand rule for cross product, not just magnitudes)\n*   d⟨S_y⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*B) = 0\n*   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0) = γB⟨S_x⟩\n\nThis describes the precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the Y-axis.

The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is described by the spin operator $\\vec{S} = (S_x, S_y, S_z)$. The magnetic moment is given by $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{init} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma B S_z$.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-up state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$) and $-\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-down state $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$).\n    *   The energies are $E = -\\gamma B (\\pm \\hbar/2)$. To minimize the energy (assuming $\\gamma$ and $B$ are positive, which is standard), we must maximize the eigenvalue of $S_z$. Thus, the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. The expectation value of the spin is purely in the z-direction: $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle_0 = \\langle\\uparrow|_z \\vec{S} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Dynamics after the Change:**\n    *   At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B\\hat{y}$.\n    *   For $t > 0$, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector is given by the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    *   $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)|S_z|\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$. There are a few ways to do this.\n\n    **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical approach)**\n    *   The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector is $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\langle\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new} = \\gamma \\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new}$.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the magnetic field axis ($\\hat{y}$) with an angular frequency $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   The initial spin vector is $\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$. This vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis.\n    *   The z-component of the precessing vector is given by $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = |\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle| \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is then $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expression for $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is a cosine function of time. The argument of the cosine is $\\omega t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   Therefore, the angular oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n    **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to compute $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. Let $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. The time evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{i\\omega_L t S_y/\\hbar}$.\n    *   The operator $e^{i\\theta S_y/\\hbar}$ represents a rotation about the y-axis by an angle $\\theta$. Here, $\\theta = \\omega_L t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   We are rotating the initial state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ around the y-axis. In terms of state vectors:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z$.\n        (Note: The angle in the spinor rotation formula is half the angle of the vector rotation).\n    *   Now, we compute the expectation value:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) S_z \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Since $S_z|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ and $S_z|\\downarrow\\rangle_z = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$, this becomes:\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the spin states ($\\langle\\uparrow|\\uparrow\\rangle = 1$, $\\langle\\downarrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=1$, $\\langle\\uparrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=0$), we get:\n        $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\right)$\n    *   Using the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   This gives the same result as the Larmor precession method. The average of the z-component of the moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates as $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.

Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_i = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    The energy levels are `E = -γ * m_s * ħ * B`, where `m_s = ±1/2` are the spin quantum numbers.\n    \"Aligned with the field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest possible value of `m_s`, which is `m_s = +1/2`. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian for t > 0.**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_y`. The magnitude `B` remains the same. The new Hamiltonian `H_f` that governs the time evolution for `t>0` is:\n    `H_f = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n    The spin operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H_f = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution of the state.**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)⟩`.\n    Let's evaluate the time evolution operator `U(t)`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (γ * B * t / 2) * σ_y)`.\n    Let `θ = γ * B * t / 2`. The operator is `exp(i * θ * σ_y)`.\n    Using the property of Pauli matrices that `σ_y^2 = I` (the identity matrix), we can expand the exponential using its Taylor series, which simplifies to:\n    `exp(i * θ * σ_y) = I * cos(θ) + i * σ_y * sin(θ)`.\n    Substituting the matrices for `I` and `σ_y`:\n    `U(t) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] * cos(γBt/2) + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(γBt/2)`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment operator is `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    The expectation value `<μ_z>` at time `t` is given by `<ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    First, let's find `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`, which is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`.\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    Now, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expression for the average of the z-component of the moment is `<μ_z>(t) = A * cos(ωt)`, where the amplitude is `A = γħ/2` and the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a 2D complex vector (a spinor).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The notation `mu (= gamma*Sz)` is a common shorthand, implying the relationship is vectorial, `μ = γS`. If we interpreted it literally, the problem would lead to a non-oscillating result, which contradicts the question's premise.\n*   **Initial Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is `B_initial = (0, 0, B)`. The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n    *   `H_initial = -γS · B_initial = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>` -> Energy `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>` -> Energy `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   The lower energy state is `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   **New Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γS · (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The system's state `|ψ(t)>` will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(iγB S_y t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator describes a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis. The angle of rotation is `θ(t) = -γBt`. The precession of the spin has begun.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. To find `<S_z(t)>`, we calculate `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are several ways to do this. A very direct method relies on the energy difference in the new system.\n\n**Method: Using Energy Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   `S_y |+y> = +(ħ/2) |+y>` -> Energy `E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>` -> Energy `E_{-y} = +γB(ħ/2)`\n\n2.  We express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the new energy eigenstates:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) |+y> + (1/√2) |-y>`\n\n3.  The state at time `t` is the time-evolved superposition:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(-iE_{+y} t/ħ) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iE_{-y} t/ħ) |-y>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n\n4.  The expectation value of an observable `A` in such a superposition will oscillate at a frequency `ω` determined by the energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y}`.\n    *   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n5.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis angular frequency `ω` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's confirm this by completing the full calculation for `<S_z(t)>`:\nFirst, express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\nThen, calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\nUsing the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe time-dependent part is `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B = - (gamma * Sz) * B`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in the lower energy state, which for a spin-1/2 particle is the `spin-up` state along Z.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenvector of `Sz` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**:\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B`\n    Here, `mu` is the magnetic moment vector operator, `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin vector operator `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n    The new magnetic field is `B = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    `H = - (gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Larmor Precession**:\n    The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -gamma * B * Sy`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This time evolution corresponds to the precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Equations of Motion (Heisenberg Picture)**:\n    A clear way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin components using the Ehrenfest theorem, which leads to the classical equation of motion for the expectation values:\n    `d<S>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[S, H]>`\n    Substituting `H = -gamma * B * Sy`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sz, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sz, Sy]>`\n\n    Using the commutation relation for spin operators, `[Si, Sj] = iħ * ε_ijk * Sk`, we find:\n    `[Sz, Sy] = iħ * ε_zyx * Sx = iħ * (-1) * Sx = -iħ * Sx`\n\n    Substituting this back into the equation for `d<Sz>/dt`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (-iħ * <Sx>) = gamma * B * <Sx>` (Equation 1)\n\n    Similarly, we find the equation for `d<Sx>/dt`:\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sx, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sx, Sy]>`\n    The commutation relation is `[Sx, Sy] = iħ * Sz`.\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (iħ * <Sz>) = -gamma * B * <Sz>` (Equation 2)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    We now have a pair of coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `<Sz(t)>`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * d<Sx>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * (-gamma * B * <Sz>)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = -(gamma * B)² * <Sz>`\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    `ω² = (gamma * B)²`\n    `ω = gamma * B`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <Sz(t)>`. Since `<Sz(t)>` oscillates with angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`, `<mu_z(t)>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (i.e., point in the `+Z` direction), the system must be in the state with the lowest energy. The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. For `⟨μ_z⟩` to be positive (aligned with `+Z`), we need `γ⟨S_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z⟩` (`E_up` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = +ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ < 0`, the lowest energy state is `|-z⟩` (`E_down` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = -ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state is an eigenstate of `S_z`. Let's assume the initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency is independent of this choice.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden approximation\" means the state of the particle does not have time to change. So, at `t=0+`, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Substituting `|ψ(t)⟩`, we get:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\nThis is a classic example of Larmor precession. The evolution of the expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`. This describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nLet's calculate this quantum mechanically. The expression `exp(-iθn⋅S/ħ) S_k exp(iθn⋅S/ħ)` represents a rotation of the operator `S_k` around the axis `n` by an angle `θ`.\n\n*   Here, the rotation axis `n` is the Y-axis.\n*   The rotation angle is `θ = γBt`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is rotated around the Y-axis. The rotated operator `S_z(t)` is:\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ)`.\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n\nNow, we compute the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z(t) |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt) |+z⟩`.\n*   This splits into two terms: `cos(γBt)⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩`.\n\nWe need the expectation values of `S_z` and `S_x` in the state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ = ħ/2` (since `|+z⟩` is an eigenstate of `S_z`).\n*   `⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩ = 0` (The expectation value of `S_x` in an eigenstate of `S_z` is zero).\n\nPlugging these values back:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt) - 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` shows that it oscillates sinusoidally with time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is the Larmor frequency. If we had chosen the initial state to be `|-z⟩`, the result would have been `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = -γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, which has the same oscillation frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analytical step-by-step derivation is provided to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, **μ** = γ**S**, is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, **B** = B **k̂**. The Hamiltonian for this situation is H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S_z. Alignment with the field means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n    *   The operator S_z has two eigenstates: spin-up |+z⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down |-z⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio γ is positive (as is common for the intrinsic spin of particles like the electron, though γ_e is negative, the \"γ\" in these problems is often treated as a positive constant), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_up.\n    *   Thus, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis: |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):**\n    Suddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B **ĵ**. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t>0 is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB S_y.\n    *   In the S_z basis, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ħ/2):\n        S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   So, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -γB(ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   U(t) = exp[-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ] = exp[iγBt S_y/ħ]\n    *   Substituting S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, we get: U(t) = exp[iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y].\n    *   Using the mathematical identity for Pauli matrices, exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix and θ = γBt/2.\n    *   U(t) = I*cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y*sin(γBt/2) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` * `[1, 0]ᵀ` = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   In bracket notation, the state at time t is: |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨γS_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   The operator S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt).\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt) describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is A*cos(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing our result with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of the oscillation is ω = γB.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and ω = γB is the Larmor frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is this angular frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`):**\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `U = -μ · B`. To be aligned, the moment must be in the lowest energy state.\n    *   The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = - (γ * S_z) * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. (Note: even if we assume `γ < 0`, the resulting oscillation frequency remains the same, as shown in the detailed calculation below).\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (`t = 0`):**\n    *   The magnetic field in the Z direction is switched off.\n    *   A new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is switched on in the +Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (`t > 0`):**\n    *   The system now evolves under a new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γ * S_vec) · (B * ŷ) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is governed by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z>(t)` and multiplying by `γ`. So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   This is a classic problem of Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S_vec>` will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency:**\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`.\n    *   As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis (and also the X-axis) will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`, and consequently `<μ_z>(t)`, is `ω = |γB|`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive constants as is typical in such problems, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Formal Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Optional but confirms the result):**\n    We can solve this formally using the matrix representation of spin operators (Pauli matrices).\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   Initial state `|+z>` is the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_n`, with `θ = γBt/2`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we compute `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation described by `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the conceptual understanding of Larmor precession and the detailed quantum mechanical calculation give the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and the magnetic field `B` is in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the field\". This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to spin-up along Z.\n*   The initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, denoted as `|+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]`.\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ = [1, 0]`\n\n### 2. Dynamics for t > 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is applied in the `+Y` direction.\n*   The change is \"sudden,\" which means the state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change. Thus, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_f = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ(S ⋅ Bŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The Hamiltonian simplifies to `H_f = -ω S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iH_f t / ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\nSubstituting `H_f`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-ωS_y)t / ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iωtS_y / ħ) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the exponential of the `S_y` operator, we use its matrix form `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n`exp(iωtS_y / ħ) = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`\n\nUsing the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`:\n`exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y`\n`= cos(ωt/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin(ωt/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n`= [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\nNow, we apply this evolution operator to our initial state:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\nUsing the matrix for `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`:\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0],[0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n\nUsing the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for the average z-component of the moment is `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`. This value oscillates in time according to the function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\nWe defined the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nThis physical phenomenon is called Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, which initially points along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle. The magnetic moment is given by the operator `vec(mu) = gamma * vec(S)`, where `vec(S)` is the spin operator and `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` along the +Z direction and is \"aligned with\" it. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_initial = -vec(mu) . vec(B) = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, 0, B) = -gamma * B * Sz`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sz` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+hbar/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-hbar/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -gamma * B * (eigenvalue of Sz)`.\n*   So, `E_up = -gamma*B*hbar/2` and `E_down = gamma*B*hbar/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state (assuming `gamma*B > 0`) is the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new field is `vec(B') = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t >= 0` is `H = -vec(mu) . vec(B') = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, B, 0) = -gamma * B * Sy`.\n*   The state of the particle will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian `H`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe oscillation frequency of an expectation value in a quantum system is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H`.**\n    The Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator `Sy`. So, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we can call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+hbar/2` and `-hbar/2`.\n    The energy eigenvalues are:\n    *   `E_+` (corresponding to `|+y>` state): `E_+ = -gamma * B * (+hbar/2) = - (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n    *   `E_-` (corresponding to `|-y>` state): `E_- = -gamma * B * (-hbar/2) = + (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Express the initial state in the basis of the new energy eigenstates.**\n    The initial state is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`. We need to express this in the `Sy` eigenbasis. The `Sy` eigenstates are related to the `Sz` eigenstates as follows:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> + i*|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> - i*|-z>)`\n    By adding these two equations, we get `|+y> + |-y> = sqrt(2) * |+z>`, which means:\n    `|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    This shows that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Relate the energy difference to the oscillation frequency.**\n    When a system is in a superposition of two energy states with energies `E_a` and `E_b`, any observable that connects these two states will have an expectation value that oscillates with an angular frequency `omega` given by:\n    `omega = |E_a - E_b| / hbar`\n    In our case, the two populated states have energies `E_+` and `E_-`. The energy difference is:\n    `Delta E = E_- - E_+ = [(gamma * B * hbar) / 2] - [- (gamma * B * hbar) / 2] = gamma * B * hbar`\n    The oscillation frequency `omega` is therefore:\n    `omega = Delta E / hbar = (gamma * B * hbar) / hbar = gamma * B`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * <Sz>(t)`, will oscillate. This oscillation arises from the coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, determined by the energy splitting caused by the new magnetic field.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis corresponds to the classical picture of Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses about the magnetic field axis (`Y`-axis in this case) with an angular frequency of `gamma * B`. The `z`-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as the cosine of this precessing angle.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
