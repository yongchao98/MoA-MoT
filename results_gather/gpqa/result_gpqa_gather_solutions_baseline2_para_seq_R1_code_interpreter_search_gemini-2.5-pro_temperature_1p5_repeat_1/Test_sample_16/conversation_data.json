This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant (K_d). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium.

This indicates that the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:** Now, we solve the simplified equation for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex can dissociate into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction for this dissociation is:\n\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex and assume that some amount, 'x', dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x'.\n\n**4. Solve for 'x'**\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation with the approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x':\n\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches the result from the code execution (`6.3e-07`).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical system and the question:** We have a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, with an initial stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M. The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n\n2.  **Write down the relevant chemical reaction:** The system will reach equilibrium through the dissociation of the complex into its constituent ions. The reaction is:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate the given constant to the reaction:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻  ⇌  [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The reaction we are analyzing is the dissociation, which is the reverse of the formation. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of all species as the system moves from the initial state to equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**      [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺  +  EDTA⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M            0 M       0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x              +x        +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  (0.02 - x) M       x M       x M\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Use the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of K_d.\n    K_d = ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) / [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ]\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The dissociation constant K_d is very small (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the reaction barely proceeds to the right. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation becomes:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺].\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculation was confirmed using the python script, which gave an output of 6.32e-07.\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value, 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

Therefore, we can assume that x is much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nSolve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The complex is in solution, and we want to find the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) that have dissociated from the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    *   Dissociation: [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [[CaY]²⁻]initial = 0.02 M.\n    *   Formation constant (also called stability constant), K_f or K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   The problem specifies \"ideal pH,\" which means we can assume EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻) and we don't need to consider side-reaction coefficients for H⁺.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant K_f is defined for the formation reaction:\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n4.  **Use an ICE Table:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction.

This means that only a tiny amount of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   The simplified equation is: 5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   Rearrange to solve for x²: x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   Calculate x²: x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root to find x: x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵ ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Result:** The variable 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    *   B) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   C) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    *   D) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    Our calculated value matches option D.

The equilibrium is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$) for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The value is given as $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. A very large $K_f$ indicates that the complex is very stable and will not dissociate much.\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is the standard approach. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n    *   **Initial:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02$ M; $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$; $[Y^{4-}] = 0$.\n    *   **Change:** $[[CaY]^{2-}]$ decreases by x; $[Ca^{2+}]$ increases by x; $[Y^{4-}]$ increases by x.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$; $[Ca^{2+}] = x$; $[Y^{4-}] = x$.\n\n4.  **Mathematical Solution:** The equilibrium concentrations can be substituted into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplifying Approximation:** Because $K_f$ is extremely large, the dissociation 'x' will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for a valid simplification:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Solving for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solving for x, which is the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll candidate answers correctly followed this logical path and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. The differences in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) appear to be due to inconsistent labeling of the options in the source material for each agent.

This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant (K_d). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium.

This indicates that the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:** Now, we solve the simplified equation for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex can dissociate into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction for this dissociation is:\n\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex and assume that some amount, 'x', dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x'.\n\n**4. Solve for 'x'**\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation with the approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x':\n\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n\n2.  **Write down the relevant chemical reaction:** The system will reach equilibrium through the dissociation of the complex into its constituent ions. The reaction is:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate the given constant to the reaction:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻  ⇌  [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The reaction we are analyzing is the dissociation, which is the reverse of the formation. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of all species as the system moves from the initial state to equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**      [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺  +  EDTA⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M            0 M       0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x              +x        +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  (0.02 - x) M       x M       x M\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Use the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of K_d.\n    K_d = ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) / [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ]\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The dissociation constant K_d is very small (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the reaction barely proceeds to the right. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation becomes:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺].\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculation was confirmed using the python script, which gave an output of 6.32e-07.\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value, 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

Therefore, we can assume that x is much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nSolve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The complex is in solution, and we want to find the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) that have dissociated from the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    *   Dissociation: [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [[CaY]²⁻]initial = 0.02 M.\n    *   Formation constant (also called stability constant), K_f or K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   The problem specifies \"ideal pH,\" which means we can assume EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻) and we don't need to consider side-reaction coefficients for H⁺.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant K_f is defined for the formation reaction:\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n4.  **Use an ICE Table:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction.

This means that only a tiny amount of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   The simplified equation is: 5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   Rearrange to solve for x²: x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   Calculate x²: x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root to find x: x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵ ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Result:** The variable 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    *   B) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   C) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    *   D) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    Our calculated value matches option D.

The reaction for this dissociation is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:**\n    The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is for the reverse reaction (dissociation) and is the reciprocal of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no free calcium or EDTA initially.

This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions, $[Ca^{2+}]_{eq}$.\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\nThis value was also confirmed by the Python script calculation which yielded $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
