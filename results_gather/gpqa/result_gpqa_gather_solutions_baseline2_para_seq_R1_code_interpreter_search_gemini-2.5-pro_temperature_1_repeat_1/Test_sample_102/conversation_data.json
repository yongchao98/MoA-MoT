Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all **meta** with respect to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: A deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH₂)**: A strongly activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. (Relevant as it's formed by reducing a nitro group, a common tactic).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Direct Synthesis vs. Indirect Synthesis\n\nA direct synthesis would involve adding the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring. For example:\n*   Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n*   Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**. The -COCH₃ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**. Bromine adds meta to the acetyl group. This works.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, the -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs meta (to C5). The -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting.\n    *   Furthermore, adding a third deactivating group to a ring that already has two is difficult and typically results in low yields. The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated, indirect route is required. The presence of steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂) and `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃PO₂` (diazotization and deamination, i.e., removal of the -NH₂ group) in the options strongly hints at a common synthetic strategy where an amino group is used as a powerful director and then removed at the end.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Options with the Deamination Strategy\n\nThe sequence `... -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO₂/HCl -> H₃PO₂` implies that a nitro group is introduced, used to create an amino directing group, and then this group is removed from the molecule. Let's trace the options with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with bromination, then nitration. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro and bromo groups. So, **A is incorrect**.\n*   **Option B**: The sequence of steps i-iv (`Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene`) is circular and makes no sense. So, **B is incorrect**.\n*   **Option D**: Involves reacting aniline with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`. This Friedel-Crafts acylation is problematic on aniline. Even if we assume it works or that it implies N-acylation, the subsequent steps do not logically lead to the target without missing steps (like hydrolysis). For example, step (vi) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires a primary amine, but the product from step (v) would be an acetanilide (an amide). So, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: Let's trace this sequence carefully. This path turns out to be a clever, multi-step synthesis that achieves the desired product in high yield.\n\n    i.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**.\n        *   An acetyl group is added. It's a meta-director.\n\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3.\n\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is a key step. The directing effects of -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) are conflicting. While the 5-nitro isomer is also formed, the 4-nitro isomer is a significant product that is required for the subsequent steps of this sequence.\n\n    iv. **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This introduces a powerful activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\n    v.  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is the crucial step for regiocontrol. We are nitrating the ring. Let's look at the directors:\n            *   -NH₂ (at C4) is a powerful activator and directs ortho/para (to C3-occupied, C5).\n            *   -COCH₃ (at C1) is a deactivator and directs meta (to C5).\n            *   -Br (at C3) is a deactivator and directs ortho/para (to C2, C6).\n        *   Both the strongest activating group (-NH₂) and the -COCH₃ group direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This concerted direction ensures the reaction is regioselective and high-yield.\n\n    vi. **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt**.\n        *   The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n    vii. **Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n        *   The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis entire sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with excellent control over the placement of the substituents, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (by induction) but an ortho/para-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward ways to introduce these three groups. The order of introduction is critical.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    i.   **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    ii.  **Acetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position (C3). This works well.\n    iii. **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -NO2 group at C3. Both are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is an excellent step, as the directors reinforce each other, leading to a high yield of the desired product.\n    *Conclusion:* This 3-step synthesis is logical and efficient. However, this sequence is not among the options provided. All options are 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex pathway is intended.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration** (This matches the beginning of Option A)\n    i.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii. **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs bromine to C3. This works.\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho/para-director (-Br at C3). They compete. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the o,p-director usually determines the position of substitution, leading to a mixture of products, primarily nitration at C2, C4, and C6. The desired product (nitration at C5) would be a minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nSince the straightforward routes are either not an option or do not provide a high yield, we must consider a more sophisticated strategy, likely one involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` sequence in the options strongly points to the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, followed by diazotization and deamination (removal of the amino group). This is a classic strategy to achieve \"difficult\" substitution patterns.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding. We are looking for a logical sequence that uses a temporary amino group to correctly position the substituents and then removes it.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    As discussed, step (iii) gives a low yield. Furthermore, the sequence starting from step (iv) is illogical. It involves reducing the nitro group just added, then trying to nitrate the resulting highly reactive amine (which would be messy), and then removing a group. This pathway is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene (deamination with H3PO2). This is a futile loop that achieves nothing.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    This sequence starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring, which would fail or give an extremely low yield. This option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence appears the most plausible, despite some ambiguously written steps which are common in such problems. Let's interpret it as a strategic synthesis:\n    i.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.**\n    iii. **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Aminoacetophenone.** While Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline itself fails, these reagents can be used for a Fries Rearrangement of an initially formed N-acyl aniline, yielding p-aminoacetophenone as the major product. This strategically places the acetyl group on the ring, para to a powerful directing amino group.\n    iv. **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 will direct the incoming bromine to one of the ortho positions (C3 or C5).\n    v.  **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone.** For this step to work cleanly, the amino group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation). Let's assume this is implicit. The directing effects would then be: -NHAc (o,p at C4) directs to C5; -COCH3 (m at C1) directs to C5; -Br (o,p at C3) directs elsewhere (C2, C6). The reinforcing effects of the acetamido and acetyl groups strongly favor nitration at C5. The amino group would be deprotected afterwards.\n    vi. **3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt.** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium group.\n    vii. **Diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis detailed pathway, which uses the amino group at C4 as a temporary directing group, successfully constructs the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern and yields the final product. It is the only sequence that represents a coherent and effective (though complex) synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to a high-yield synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order where their directing effects work together (are reinforcing) or at least do not conflict in a way that produces multiple isomers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → **Bromobenzene**.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director. This will produce a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) makes the ring too electron-poor to undergo acylation. Therefore, this step would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   iii) Aniline is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that puts a positive charge on the nitrogen, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   This sequence starts with:\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction to aniline.\n    *   iii) Diazotization of aniline to benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   iv) Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to remove the nitrogen group.\n*   The net result of steps i-iv is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is nonsensical for synthesizing the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. This introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to position 3. The major product will be 3-bromoacetophenone. This creates the desired 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's look at the directing effects of the two existing groups:\n    *   The **-COCH3** group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, so it directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The **-Br** group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director. It directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho positions (positions 2 and 4) and its para position (position 6). However, considering the combined directing effects, the position that is *ortho* to Br and *meta* to COCH3 is position 5.\n    *   Both existing groups reinforce the directing of the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This leads to a high yield of the desired single product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be distractors. However, the initial three steps constitute a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, only the sequence starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (the first three steps of option D) provides a viable and efficient route to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   Substituents are at positions 1 (-COCH3), 3 (-Br), and 5 (-NO2).\n*   The three substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Evaluation of a Direct Synthesis Route:**\nA simple, direct synthesis might be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the meta position.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are meta-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5.\n\nThis three-step synthesis is regiochemically correct. However, the final step (bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone) would be very slow and require harsh conditions because the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The provided options are all seven steps long, suggesting a more complex, indirect route is necessary to achieve a good yield. Such routes often involve using a temporary directing group that is later modified or removed. The presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly points to the use of an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful ortho,para-directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options start with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to form aniline. However, Option B proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (iii), which is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail or give poor yields of the meta product. Option C proposes a sequence (i-iv) that converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the nitro group is a very strong deactivator. Therefore, this step would fail, making Option D incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence appears to be the most chemically sound, employing the strategy of using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps carefully:\n\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**: Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group leads to bromination at the C3 position.\n\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**: This is a crucial step. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects conflict. However, substitution is most likely at C4 (ortho to the o,p-director and meta to the m-director) and C6. Position 4 is generally favored. The product formed is 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, which is the key intermediate for the next steps.\n\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**: The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine.\n\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**: Now, a second nitration is performed. The powerful activating and ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 dictates the position of the new substituent. It directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position, C5 (C3 is already occupied). The other groups on the ring (-COCH3 and -Br) are also consistent with substitution at C5. This step has excellent regioselectivity.\n\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation**: The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n\n    vii) **Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination reaction). This leaves the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups in the desired 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nThis sequence is a clever and synthetically valid route that uses an amino group (generated from an initial nitro group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group at the correct position with high selectivity, before being removed. This pathway would lead to a high yield of the target product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we must consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The main challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a position that is *meta* to the other two groups. This suggests that the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider the final step of the synthesis. Which group should be added last?\n\n    *   **Case 1: Add the acetyl group last (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).**\n        The precursor would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule contains two deactivating groups, one of which is the strongly deactivating nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions, including acylation, generally fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene and its derivatives. Therefore, this route is not feasible for a high-yield synthesis. The acetyl group must be introduced earlier.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Add the nitro group or the bromo group last.**\n        This means the synthesis must start with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene.\n        *   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone.\n            Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n            Now we have the acetyl group on the ring, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n        Now, we need to add the -Br and -NO2 groups to the meta positions (3 and 5). We have two choices for the next step: bromination or nitration.\n\n        *   **Path A: Brominate first, then nitrate.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Bromination.** Acetophenone is treated with Br2 and FeBr3. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be added at position 3.\n                Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3a: Nitration.** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has an acetyl group (m-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (o,p-director) at position 3.\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Both groups are deactivating. Electrophilic attack is generally disfavored at positions ortho to a deactivating group. Position 5 is meta to both substituents and is the least deactivated position. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at position 5.\n                3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                This sequence is chemically sound and known to produce the desired product in good yield.\n\n        *   **Path B: Nitrate first, then brominate.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Nitration.** Acetophenone is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 3.\n                Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3b: Bromination.** We now brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 (-COCH3) and 3 (-NO2). Both groups reinforce each other, directing the incoming bromo group to position 5.\n                3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                While this path also leads to the correct product, the ring in step 3b is more strongly deactivated (due to -NO2 being more deactivating than -Br) than the ring in step 3a. This would require harsher reaction conditions and likely result in a lower yield. Thus, Path A is the superior \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n4.  **Match the Best Strategy to the Given Options:**\n    The best synthesis route we identified is:\n    i) Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)\n    ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)\n    iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ... — Incorrect start.\n    *   B) **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ... — The first three steps perfectly match our optimal synthesis route. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the target molecule, indicating a potential flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only one provided that correctly and efficiently leads to the desired product.\n    *   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... — This sequence starts by making benzene from benzene, which is incorrect.\n    *   D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... — This would lead to 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and subsequent acylation would fail or give the wrong isomer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B is the only choice that begins with the correct, high-yield sequence of reactions to produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Despite the superfluous steps listed afterward, the core of the synthesis presented is the most valid among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: all three groups are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (Relevant for intermediates in some options).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it can logically produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Sequence A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene:** Nitration of benzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2). The -NH2 group is strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This step is highly problematic. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-N+H2-AlCl3), which prevents the desired reaction on the ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence B:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** Bromination of benzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene -> o/p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (4-bromonitrobenzene) being the major one. This does not lead to a *meta* relationship between Br and NO2.\n    3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on this ring is very difficult because it is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Even if it worked, the directing effects would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n    3.  **Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride:** Diazotization of aniline.\n    4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene:** Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 removes the group entirely, regenerating the starting material, benzene. This sequence is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Sequence D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom is added at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is an electrophilic nitration on 3-bromoacetophenone. We must consider the directing effects of both substituents:\n        *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        At first glance, the directors seem to conflict. However, the -COCH3 group is a strong deactivator, making the positions *ortho* and *para* to it (positions 2, 4, 6) very unreactive. The least deactivated position on the ring is position 5 (meta to the strong deactivator). Therefore, the nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, yielding the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This reaction is known to proceed with a good yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the desired product if carried out, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product. This implies that the correct path is contained within the option.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D correctly outlines the steps to first install a *meta*-director (acetyl group), then use it to direct the second substituent (bromo group) to the meta position, and finally, perform a third substitution (nitration) which is directed to the only remaining favorable position to give the 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are **meta** (in a 1,3,5 relationship) to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent influences the position of subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring is challenging, especially when one of the substituents is an ortho, para-director (-Br) and the other two are meta-directors (-COCH3, -NO2). A direct sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work efficiently.\n*   If we try to add the three groups directly, their directing effects will conflict. For example, if we have a 1,3-disubstituted ring with a meta-director and an o,p-director, the third substituent will likely lead to a mixture of products.\n*   Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH3 group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. This means the acylation step must happen before nitration, or an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nThe presence of steps like reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy involving the use of a temporary amino group (-NH2) to control the regiochemistry. The amino group can be introduced by reducing a nitro group, and it can be removed completely after it has served its directing purpose.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\niii) Product from (ii) + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitro-substituted benzene ring. The reaction is extremely slow or fails due to the strong deactivating effect of the nitro group. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) Aniline → Diazonium salt\niv) Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination). This sequence just regenerates the starting material, benzene, and then proceeds with further reactions on it, which is nonsensical. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. If it were to proceed, it would likely yield the meta product (3-aminoacetophenone), but it's not a standard, high-yield reaction. Assuming it works and gives 3-aminoacetophenone:\niv) 3-aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → The powerful activating -NH2 group directs ortho/para. Under acidic conditions (FeBr3 is a Lewis acid), the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -COCH3 group is also a meta-director. Starting with substituents at C1 and C3, both direct to C5. So we would get 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone.\nv) Nitration of 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has three substituents: -NH3+ (meta), -Br (o,p), and -COCH3 (meta). The ring is extremely deactivated by two strong deactivators (-NH3+, -COCH3) making this nitration step very difficult, if not impossible. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs the strategy of using a temporary group to control regiochemistry.\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. (This adds the acetyl group early, avoiding issues with Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step is regioselective).\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitration**. Here, the directing effects conflict (-COCH3 is meta, -Br is o,p). This will produce a mixture of isomers, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. Crucially, the synthesis does not require this step to be selective. Let's call the product mixture **Isomer Mix**.\niv) Isomer Mix + Fe/HCl → **Reduction**. The nitro group in all isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have a mixture of 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. Let's call this **Amino Mix**.\nv) Amino Mix + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Second Nitration**. This is the key step.\n    *   In 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    *   In 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C6) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    This step is highly regioselective for both components of the mixture, yielding a mix of 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. The desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern is now established.\nvi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → **Diazotization**. The amino group (-NH2) in both isomers is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\nvii) Product from (vi) + H3PO2 → **Deamination**. The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Removing the group at C4 from the first isomer leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   Removing the group at C6 from the second isomer also leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    Both paths converge to the same final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis synthetic route is elegant because it doesn't rely on a difficult separation or a selective reaction in step (iii). Instead, it uses the initial nitro group as a \"sacrificial\" directing group that is later removed, ensuring a high overall yield of the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in Option A is the correct and most effective pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding -COCH3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with a -NO2 group is too deactivated. It also does not work on rings with an -NH2 group (aniline) because the amine is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst.\n*   **1,3,5-Substitution:** To achieve this pattern, we generally need to use *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitutions, or use a \"placeholder\" group that can be modified or removed later (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This successfully creates a 1,3 substitution pattern.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated overall. The reaction is known to proceed with good yield to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. **At this point, the target molecule has been synthesized.**\n*   The remaining steps (iv-vii) seem extraneous and chemically flawed (e.g., nitrating a sensitive aniline derivative), but the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n*   **Step iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) results in converting benzene back into benzene. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** The -Br group is *ortho, para*-directing, with the *para* product favored.\n*   **Step iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on aniline. The lone pair of the -NH2 group (a Lewis base) will react with the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule. The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The first three steps of Option A represent the most effective synthesis among the choices. The superfluous steps at the end are likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1.

The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex.

Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta position (C3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration. Now we must place the nitro group.\n    *   The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1, meta-director) and -Br (at C3, ortho, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, in such cases, we must also consider steric hindrance and the relative deactivating strengths. The positions ortho to the substituents (2 and ortho-part of 6) are sterically hindered. A detailed analysis shows that the least disfavored position is C5. Therefore, nitration occurs at position 5, yielding **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired product. This pathway is known to produce the target compound as the major product.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These subsequent steps (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) would modify and ultimately destroy the target molecule that was already successfully synthesized in step iii. These steps appear to be extraneous and are likely an error in the question's formatting. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in its initial steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or incompatible reactions. Despite the superfluous final steps listed in option D, it is the only choice that correctly describes how to build the molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Structure and Directing Effects:**\n    *   The substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n    *   -COCH3 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -Br is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider adding the three groups directly to benzene.\n*   **Problem:** It's very difficult to add three groups in a 1,3,5-pattern when they don't all direct to the same places. More importantly, Friedel-Crafts reactions, like the acylation needed to add the -COCH3 group (CH3COCl/AlCl3), fail on strongly deactivated rings. If we add the -NO2 and -Br groups first, the ring becomes too deactivated for the final acylation step.\n*   **Route 1:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (OK)\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a meta-director, so this works well).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → Target. (The -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are both meta-directors. They both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5. The regiochemistry is perfect).\n*   **Potential Flaw:** The final bromination step is performed on a ring with two deactivating groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This makes the ring very unreactive towards electrophilic substitution. While the selectivity is good, the reaction rate is very low, and standard conditions (Br2/FeBr3) give very poor yields (reported as ~11%). Achieving a \"high-yield\" requires very harsh, specific conditions not implied by the question's reagents. Therefore, this simple route is likely not the intended answer for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate Indirect Synthesis Routes (The \"Amino Group\" Strategy)**\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy. This strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing an amino group (-NH2), usually from a nitro group.\n2.  Using the powerful ortho, para-directing effect of the amino group (or its protected form, acetamido -NHCOCH3) to place other substituents.\n3.  Removing the amino group via diazotization and deamination.\n\nThis is a classic method for synthesizing substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each option to see if it follows a logical path to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone. Here, -COCH3 directs to position 5, but -Br (an o,p-director) directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directors are in conflict, which will lead to a mixture of products, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence just returns to the starting material, benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of p-Bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both -Br and -NO2 groups. This reaction fails. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's see if we can find a plausible (though complex) path that matches these reagents. The overall strategy must be the amino-group-directed synthesis. A successful, high-yield synthesis is as follows:\n    1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** (Matches steps **i** and **ii**).\n    2.  **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone.** This is a complex transformation. A possible way is protecting the aniline as acetanilide, performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (which gives the para product), and then deprotecting. Let's assume the single step **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3** is a shorthand for this entire process of getting the acetyl group onto the ring para to the amino group. The product is 4-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **4-aminoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** This is step **iv) Br2/FeBr3**. The directing effects are checked: The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group and the m-directing -COCH3 group both direct bromination to position 3. This is a reinforcing effect and works well.\n    4.  **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is step **v) HNO3/H2SO4**. For this to work in high yield, the powerful -NH2 group must direct the nitration to position 5 (ortho to itself). This requires non-acidic conditions to avoid protonating the amine to the meta-directing -NH3+. Assuming such conditions are implied, this step is plausible.\n    5.  **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazotize the -NH2 group.** This is step **vi) NaNO2/HCl**. This is the standard reaction.\n    6.  **Diazonium salt → Deamination (remove the N2+ group).** This is step **vii) H3PO2**. Removing the directing group at position 4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5. This yields the target product.\n\n    While the description of steps (iii) and (v) in option A is imprecise, the overall sequence of transformations represents a valid and high-yield synthetic strategy for this challenging target molecule. The other options contain fundamental flaws (failed reactions, incorrect regiochemistry, pointless loops). Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the provided reaction options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Let's number the ring starting from the acetyl group at C1. The bromo group is at C3, and the nitro group is at C5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nTo plan a synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group)**: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is relevant as it is formed by reducing a nitro group (Fe/HCl).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium ion)**: Formed from -NH2 in strong acid. Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nA critical rule in EAS is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. This means we cannot perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that already has a -NO2 group or other strongly deactivating groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating a \"Simple\" Direct Synthesis\nLet's first consider the most direct way to assemble the molecule. The Friedel-Crafts acylation must be done before the ring is strongly deactivated (i.e., before nitration).\n1.  **Acylation**: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  Now we need to add -Br and -NO2 to acetophenone at the meta positions (C3 and C5). Let's consider the two possible orders.\n    *   **Order A: Nitrate then Brominate**\n        a. **Nitration**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This works well.\n        b. **Bromination**: 3-Nitroacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -NO2 (at C3, m-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. The directing effects are **reinforcing**. This is an excellent synthetic step.\n        *This sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a highly efficient and logical route to the target molecule.*\n\n    *   **Order B: Brominate then Nitrate**\n        a. **Bromination**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n        b. **Nitration**: 3-Bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -Br (at C3, o,p-director). The directors are in **conflict**. -COCH3 directs to C5, while -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThe best simple route is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. However, none of the options list this sequence. This suggests we must evaluate the given, more complex options, which likely involve using a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) sequence points to this strategy. This sequence effectively replaces a -NO2 group with a -H atom, via an -NH2 intermediate.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Given Options\n\n*   **Option A**: i) Acylation; ii) Bromination; iii) Nitration... This follows Order B discussed above. It's plausible but potentially low-yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically flawed if they are to follow step (iii). For instance, step (v) involves nitrating a product that contains an unprotected amino group under strongly acidic conditions, which would either oxidize the amine or protonate it into a meta-director, leading to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option C & D**: Option C fails because step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, a strongly deactivated ring. This reaction does not work. Option D involves a circular sequence of steps (i-iv) that converts benzene back to benzene, making it nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option B**: Let's trace this pathway carefully. It employs the temporary directing group strategy.\n    i)   **Benzene → Nitrobenzene** (HNO3/H2SO4). Standard.\n    ii)  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline** (Fe/HCl). Standard reduction. The ring now has a powerful o,p-directing -NH2 group.\n    iii) **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This step is written as a Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline, which is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group. However, this sequence of reagents can be interpreted as a shorthand for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**, which moves the acetyl group from the nitrogen to the ring, predominantly at the para position. Let's assume this gives p-aminoacetophenone.\n    iv) **p-Aminoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone** (Br2/FeBr3). We brominate p-aminoacetophenone. The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group at C4 will direct the bromine to its ortho position, C3. This is a plausible step.\n    v)  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone** (HNO3/H2SO4). We nitrate the product from step (iv). Again, the powerful activating -NH2 group at C4 will direct the incoming -NO2 group to its other vacant ortho position, C5. (Note: In practice, the amino group would be protected as an amide to prevent oxidation and protonation, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, we assume the desired regiochemistry is achieved).\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt** (NaNO2/HCl). The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium group (-N2+).\n    vii) **Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (H3PO2). The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThe final product has the -COCH3 group at C1, -Br at C3, and -NO2 at C5. This matches the target molecule exactly. Although this path relies on a charitable interpretation of steps (iii) and (v), it is the only sequence provided that logically leads to the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically impossible steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the position of the acetyl group (-COCH3) as C1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at C3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other on the ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each substituent is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director. It is installed via bromination (e.g., Br2/FeBr3).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via nitration (e.g., HNO3/H2SO4).\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nThere are important rules and limitations in electrophilic aromatic substitution that must be considered:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO2 group). They also fail on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3).\n*   **Order Matters:** The order in which substituents are introduced determines the final substitution pattern, as each new substituent is directed by the groups already present on the ring.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> p-Bromonitrobenzene** (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group and also deactivated by the -Br group. The Friedel-Crafts reaction will not proceed or will give a very low yield. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.** The -NH2 group is strongly activating and an *o,p*-director.\n3.  **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the catalyst and the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   The first four steps are: Nitration -> Reduction to Amine -> Diazotization -> Deamination. This sequence (i-iv) takes benzene and converts it back to benzene, making these steps redundant and illogical.\n*   Let's look at the sequence starting from benzene for the relevant substitutions: v) Br2/FeBr3 followed by vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3.\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Bromoacetophenone** (major product) + o-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **p-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ???** Now we nitrate p-bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -Br at C4). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to C3, C5). The -Br group directs *ortho* (to C3, C5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. So, the product will be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** This is the Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acetyl group (-COCH3) is added, which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine will add to the meta position (C3). The structure is now correct for the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n    *   -Br (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, directing to C2, C4, C6.\n    In cases of conflicting directors where one is a strong *meta*-director (like -COCH3) and the other is a weaker *o,p*-director (like -Br), the position that is least deactivated will be attacked. The -COCH3 group strongly deactivates its *ortho* and *para* positions (C2, C4, C6), making C5 the most favorable site for electrophilic attack. This reaction is known to produce the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence C successfully produce the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) appear to be erroneous additions to the question, as they would modify the correct product into something else. However, among the given choices, Option C is the only one that contains a valid and high-yield pathway to the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions involves first introducing the *meta*-directing acetyl group, followed by sequential substitutions that are directed by the groups already on the ring to form the 1,3,5 pattern. Option C provides a valid synthetic route in its first three steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere's a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** at position 1. This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).\n    *   A **bromo group (-Br)** at position 3. This is a deactivating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. It is introduced by electrophilic bromination (Br2/FeBr3).\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).\n*   The substitution pattern is **1,3,5**. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring in the correct positions to achieve high yield. The order of reactions is crucial due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **Constraint on Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acetyl group (-COCH3) must be added to the ring before the nitro group, or at least when the ring is not yet strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's consider a direct approach by sequentially adding the groups.\n\n**Direct Synthesis Pathway (Hypothesis)**\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acylation.** Start with benzene and add the acetyl group. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Nitration.** Nitrate acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the meta position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This is a high-yield reaction.\n3.  **Step 3: Bromination.** Brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring now has two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -NO2 (meta). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. Their directing effects reinforce each other.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is heavily deactivated, making the reaction slow, it is very clean (regioselective) and should give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThis three-step synthesis (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is the most chemically sound and high-yield route. Now, we must check if any of the given options match this sequence or another valid sequence.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nAll options present a seven-step sequence involving a recurring set of reagents: CH3COCl/AlCl3, Br2/FeBr3, HNO3/H2SO4 (x2), Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2. The sequence `Fe/HCl` (reduces NO2 to NH2) followed by `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) and `H3PO2` (deamination) is used to remove an amino group, which suggests a complex synthesis using a temporary directing group. However, let's analyze the options as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    This sequence starts by nitrating benzene to nitrobenzene, reducing it to aniline, then diazotizing and deaminating it back to benzene. This is a pointless circle and therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `...ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This option attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction does not work. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-), which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `...ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This sequence produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product from i and ii) and then attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group. The FC acylation will not proceed in any significant yield. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard and effective first step.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step works well to produce the meta-brominated product.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Here, we are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. We have two directing groups: -COCH3 (meta-director, at position 1) and -Br (ortho-, para-director, at position 3). The -COCH3 directs to position 5. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directing effects are in conflict. This will result in a mixture of isomers, with the main products being 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. The desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone will be formed, but as a minor product. Therefore, this step does not lead to a *high-yield* synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Choice**\n\n*   Options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n*   The first three steps of Option C (`Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration`) can produce the desired molecule, although not in high yield due to the non-selective nitration in the third step.\n*   The optimal sequence (`Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination`) is not provided as an option.\n*   The steps following step (iii) in option C (`iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`) are nonsensical. They would involve reducing the product's nitro group, then attempting another nitration, and finally removing the newly formed amine, ultimately leading back to an earlier intermediate.\n\nGiven the choices, there appears to be a flaw in the question or the options. However, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" or \"least incorrect\" answer. Options B and D are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. Option A is circular. Option C, while not providing a \"high-yield\" route because of a single conflicting step, at least follows a sequence of individually plausible reactions that *can* lead to the formation of the target product. It's the most plausible synthetic logic among the choices, despite its significant drawbacks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests a specific strategy. To achieve this pattern with high yield, we should perform substitutions under the influence of *meta*-directing groups. The presence of an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) complicates things, so its introduction needs careful timing.\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration** of acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination** of 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are strong *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromo group to position C5. This reaction should be highly regioselective, giving the desired product.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule)\n\nThis ideal sequence of key reactions is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided to see which one matches or most closely resembles this ideal strategy. We'll focus on the order of introduction of the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups. We will also consider the additional steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   This sequence is Bromination → Nitration → Acylation.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group, making this reaction extremely difficult and low-yield. This option is not viable for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   This sequence is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing -COCH3 group correctly places the bromine at C3.\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here we have two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   The o,p-directing effect of the halogen typically overrides the meta-director. The positions activated by the halogen (C2, C4, C6) are kinetically favored over the highly deactivated C5 position (which is meta to both groups). This step would produce a mixture of isomers, with the desired 1,3,5 product being a very minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" route under standard kinetic control.\n    *   However, compared to other options, this sequence starts plausibly. Friedel-Crafts on nitro-compounds (Options A, C) is generally considered to fail. While step (iii) in B has regioselectivity issues, the reaction itself is feasible. The question's reference to \"high yield\" might imply thermodynamic control where the more stable 1,3,5-isomer could be favored, or it might be that this is the \"best\" flawed option.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and diazotization seem superfluous if the target is made at step (iii), suggesting they may be distractors or part of an convoluted and incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) ... ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...\n    *   This sequence attempts Acylation after Nitration and other steps. After steps (i) Nitration and (ii) Bromination, the intermediate would be 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation of 3-bromonitrobenzene fails for the same reason as in Option A: the ring is strongly deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration, reduction to aniline, then deamination back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A and C fail because they schedule a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated, nitro-substituted ring.\n*   Option D is a logically flawed sequence.\n*   Option B follows a sequence of reactions where each step is chemically possible, although the nitration step (iii) suffers from poor regioselectivity for the desired product under normal conditions.\n\nDespite the low yield of the specific isomer in step (iii), Option B represents the most plausible sequence among the given choices, as the other options contain steps that are generally considered to be non-viable. The ideal pathway (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a small permutation of Option B (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration). It's possible the question considers this route viable, perhaps assuming conditions that favor the thermodynamic 1,3,5 product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents:\n1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n-   -COCH3 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n-   -Br is a deactivating, ortho,para-directing group.\n-   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring often involves using a powerful directing group that is later removed or modified. A common strategy is to use an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong ortho,para-director, and then remove it at the end of the synthesis via a Sandmeyer-type reaction (diazotization followed by reduction). The presence of steps involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of the diazonium group with -H) in options A, B, and C suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene:** This is the standard nitration of benzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\nii) **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong ortho,para-director.\niii) **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** This step represents Friedel-Crafts acylation. Direct acylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex. However, it is possible to achieve this transformation. A common way is N-acylation to form acetanilide, followed by a Fries rearrangement to yield ortho- and para-aminoacetophenone. The para-isomer is usually the major product. Let's assume this step yields **p-aminoacetophenone** [1-(4-aminophenyl)ethan-1-one].\niv) **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> ?** Bromination. We now have two directing groups: -NH2 (at position 4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at position 1, m-director).\n    -   The -NH2 group directs bromination to its ortho positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The -COCH3 group directs bromination to its meta positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The groups are cooperative, so bromination will occur with high yield at position 3 (or 5, which is equivalent). The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\nv) **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. We now have three directing groups: -COCH3 (at 1, meta), -Br (at 3, o,p), and -NH2 (at 4, strong o,p).\n    -   -NH2 at C-4 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -COCH3 at C-1 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -Br at C-3 directs to C-2 and C-6.\n    -   The powerful activating -NH2 group and the meta-directing -COCH3 group both strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. Their influence overrides the weaker directing effect of bromine. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\nvi) **Diazotization --(NaNO2/HCl)-->** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\nvii) **Deamination --(H3PO2)-->** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This removes the amino group that was used to direct the substitutions.\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This synthetic pathway is logical and all steps contribute to the formation of the desired product in high yield.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** (-COCH3 is a m-director).\nii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** (-COCH3 directs Br to the meta position).\niii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. The ring has a -COCH3 group (meta-director) and a -Br group (o,p-director). The -Br group is a stronger director in terms of position, so nitration would primarily occur at positions 4 and 6 (ortho/para to bromine), not position 5 (meta to both). This step would not give the desired precursor in high yield. The rest of the sequence is nonsensical as it involves reducing the nitro group only to nitrate the ring again. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** (-Br is an o,p-director).\nii) **Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\niii) **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction is extremely slow and low-yielding. Furthermore, both -Br and -NO2 direct the incoming acetyl group to position 2 (ortho to Br, meta to NO2). This would form 1-(2-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone, where the acetyl and bromo groups are ortho, not meta as required in the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni-iv) **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene:** These steps just nitrate benzene and then remove the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Option A outlines a viable and strategic synthesis route that uses an amino group as a temporary directing group to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern required.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. It has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** at C1 (meta-director, deactivating)\n*   A **bromo group (-Br)** at C3 (ortho,para-director, deactivating)\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at C5 (meta-director, strongly deactivating)\n\nThe key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are meta to each other. Synthesizing such a molecule with high yield is challenging, especially with a mix of meta- and ortho,para-directors. Direct sequential addition often leads to mixtures of products or fails due to deactivation of the ring.\n\nThe question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis and the options include reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`). This is a strong indicator that the intended solution involves a sophisticated, indirect route using an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the sequence.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this understanding:\n\n*   **Option B (`i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`):** Steps (i) through (iv) result in the conversion of benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a futile loop that accomplishes nothing and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D (`i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`):** Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product of steps i and ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group. This reaction would fail, so this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C (`i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`):** This is a plausible indirect route. However, step (iii), a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of step ii), is problematic as written. The basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. While alternative methods exist to achieve this transformation (e.g., Fries rearrangement), the specified reagents for this step make the sequence flawed.\n\n*   **Option A (`i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`):** This sequence represents a brilliant convergent synthesis that guarantees a high yield.\n    *   **i) Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Bromination:** The meta-directing acetyl group places the bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) Nitration:** The directing effects of the -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho,para) groups are in conflict. This step is not selective and produces a mixture of isomers, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. This might seem like a poor step, but the subsequent reactions solve this problem.\n    *   **iv) Reduction:** The nitro groups on both isomers in the mixture are reduced to amino groups with `Fe/HCl`.\n    *   **v) Second Nitration:** This is the key step. On both isomers, the powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group now **cooperatively** direct the new nitro group to position 5. The reaction is highly selective for both components of the mixture.\n    *   **vi & vii) Diazotization and Deamination:** The temporary amino group is removed using `NaNO2/HCl` and `H3PO2`. Since this removes the directing group from different positions (C4 or C6), both parallel pathways **converge** to the same final product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A outlines an elegant and effective synthetic strategy. It strategically uses a non-selective step and resolves the resulting mixture in a later, highly selective step where both pathways converge. This is a classic example of a high-yield synthesis for a complex substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are illogical.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all **meta** with respect to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: A deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH₂)**: A strongly activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. (Relevant as it's formed by reducing a nitro group, a common tactic).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Direct Synthesis vs. Indirect Synthesis\n\nA direct synthesis would involve adding the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring. For example:\n*   Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n*   Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**. The -COCH₃ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**. Bromine adds meta to the acetyl group. This works.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, the -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs meta (to C5). The -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting.\n    *   Furthermore, adding a third deactivating group to a ring that already has two is difficult and typically results in low yields. The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated, indirect route is required. The presence of steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂) and `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃PO₂` (diazotization and deamination, i.e., removal of the -NH₂ group) in the options strongly hints at a common synthetic strategy where an amino group is used as a powerful director and then removed at the end.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Options with the Deamination Strategy\n\nThe sequence `... -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO₂/HCl -> H₃PO₂` implies that a nitro group is introduced, used to create an amino directing group, and then this group is removed from the molecule. Let's trace the options with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with bromination, then nitration. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro and bromo groups. So, **A is incorrect**.\n*   **Option B**: The sequence of steps i-iv (`Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene`) is circular and makes no sense. So, **B is incorrect**.\n*   **Option D**: Involves reacting aniline with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`. This Friedel-Crafts acylation is problematic on aniline. Even if we assume it works or that it implies N-acylation, the subsequent steps do not logically lead to the target without missing steps (like hydrolysis). For example, step (vi) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires a primary amine, but the product from step (v) would be an acetanilide (an amide). So, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: Let's trace this sequence carefully. This path turns out to be a clever, multi-step synthesis that achieves the desired product in high yield.\n\n    i.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**.\n        *   An acetyl group is added. It's a meta-director.\n\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3.\n\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is a key step. The directing effects of -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) are conflicting. While the 5-nitro isomer is also formed, the 4-nitro isomer is a significant product that is required for the subsequent steps of this sequence.\n\n    iv. **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This introduces a powerful activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\n    v.  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is the crucial step for regiocontrol. We are nitrating the ring. Let's look at the directors:\n            *   -NH₂ (at C4) is a powerful activator and directs ortho/para (to C3-occupied, C5).\n            *   -COCH₃ (at C1) is a deactivator and directs meta (to C5).\n            *   -Br (at C3) is a deactivator and directs ortho/para (to C2, C6).\n        *   Both the strongest activating group (-NH₂) and the -COCH₃ group direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This concerted direction ensures the reaction is regioselective and high-yield.\n\n    vi. **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt**.\n        *   The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n    vii. **Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n        *   The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis entire sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with excellent control over the placement of the substituents, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (by induction) but an ortho/para-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward ways to introduce these three groups. The order of introduction is critical.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    i.   **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    ii.  **Acetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position (C3). This works well.\n    iii. **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -NO2 group at C3. Both are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is an excellent step, as the directors reinforce each other, leading to a high yield of the desired product.\n    *Conclusion:* This 3-step synthesis is logical and efficient. However, this sequence is not among the options provided. All options are 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex pathway is intended.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration** (This matches the beginning of Option A)\n    i.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii. **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs bromine to C3. This works.\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho/para-director (-Br at C3). They compete. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the o,p-director usually determines the position of substitution, leading to a mixture of products, primarily nitration at C2, C4, and C6. The desired product (nitration at C5) would be a minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nSince the straightforward routes are either not an option or do not provide a high yield, we must consider a more sophisticated strategy, likely one involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` sequence in the options strongly points to the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, followed by diazotization and deamination (removal of the amino group). This is a classic strategy to achieve \"difficult\" substitution patterns.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding. We are looking for a logical sequence that uses a temporary amino group to correctly position the substituents and then removes it.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    As discussed, step (iii) gives a low yield. Furthermore, the sequence starting from step (iv) is illogical. It involves reducing the nitro group just added, then trying to nitrate the resulting highly reactive amine (which would be messy), and then removing a group. This pathway is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene (deamination with H3PO2). This is a futile loop that achieves nothing.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    This sequence starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring, which would fail or give an extremely low yield. This option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence appears the most plausible, despite some ambiguously written steps which are common in such problems. Let's interpret it as a strategic synthesis:\n    i.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.**\n    iii. **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Aminoacetophenone.** While Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline itself fails, these reagents can be used for a Fries Rearrangement of an initially formed N-acyl aniline, yielding p-aminoacetophenone as the major product. This strategically places the acetyl group on the ring, para to a powerful directing amino group.\n    iv. **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 will direct the incoming bromine to one of the ortho positions (C3 or C5).\n    v.  **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone.** For this step to work cleanly, the amino group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation). Let's assume this is implicit. The directing effects would then be: -NHAc (o,p at C4) directs to C5; -COCH3 (m at C1) directs to C5; -Br (o,p at C3) directs elsewhere (C2, C6). The reinforcing effects of the acetamido and acetyl groups strongly favor nitration at C5. The amino group would be deprotected afterwards.\n    vi. **3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt.** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium group.\n    vii. **Diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis detailed pathway, which uses the amino group at C4 as a temporary directing group, successfully constructs the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern and yields the final product. It is the only sequence that represents a coherent and effective (though complex) synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to a high-yield synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order where their directing effects work together (are reinforcing) or at least do not conflict in a way that produces multiple isomers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → **Bromobenzene**.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director. This will produce a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) makes the ring too electron-poor to undergo acylation. Therefore, this step would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   iii) Aniline is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that puts a positive charge on the nitrogen, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   This sequence starts with:\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction to aniline.\n    *   iii) Diazotization of aniline to benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   iv) Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to remove the nitrogen group.\n*   The net result of steps i-iv is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is nonsensical for synthesizing the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. This introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to position 3. The major product will be 3-bromoacetophenone. This creates the desired 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's look at the directing effects of the two existing groups:\n    *   The **-COCH3** group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, so it directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The **-Br** group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director. It directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho positions (positions 2 and 4) and its para position (position 6). However, considering the combined directing effects, the position that is *ortho* to Br and *meta* to COCH3 is position 5.\n    *   Both existing groups reinforce the directing of the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This leads to a high yield of the desired single product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be distractors. However, the initial three steps constitute a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, only the sequence starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (the first three steps of option D) provides a viable and efficient route to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   Substituents are at positions 1 (-COCH3), 3 (-Br), and 5 (-NO2).\n*   The three substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Evaluation of a Direct Synthesis Route:**\nA simple, direct synthesis might be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the meta position.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are meta-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5.\n\nThis three-step synthesis is regiochemically correct. However, the final step (bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone) would be very slow and require harsh conditions because the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The provided options are all seven steps long, suggesting a more complex, indirect route is necessary to achieve a good yield. Such routes often involve using a temporary directing group that is later modified or removed. The presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly points to the use of an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful ortho,para-directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options start with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to form aniline. However, Option B proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (iii), which is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail or give poor yields of the meta product. Option C proposes a sequence (i-iv) that converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the nitro group is a very strong deactivator. Therefore, this step would fail, making Option D incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence appears to be the most chemically sound, employing the strategy of using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps carefully:\n\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**: Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group leads to bromination at the C3 position.\n\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**: This is a crucial step. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects conflict. However, substitution is most likely at C4 (ortho to the o,p-director and meta to the m-director) and C6. Position 4 is generally favored. The product formed is 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, which is the key intermediate for the next steps.\n\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**: The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine.\n\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**: Now, a second nitration is performed. The powerful activating and ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 dictates the position of the new substituent. It directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position, C5 (C3 is already occupied). The other groups on the ring (-COCH3 and -Br) are also consistent with substitution at C5. This step has excellent regioselectivity.\n\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation**: The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n\n    vii) **Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination reaction). This leaves the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups in the desired 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nThis sequence is a clever and synthetically valid route that uses an amino group (generated from an initial nitro group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group at the correct position with high selectivity, before being removed. This pathway would lead to a high yield of the target product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we must consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The main challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a position that is *meta* to the other two groups. This suggests that the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider the final step of the synthesis. Which group should be added last?\n\n    *   **Case 1: Add the acetyl group last (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).**\n        The precursor would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule contains two deactivating groups, one of which is the strongly deactivating nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions, including acylation, generally fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene and its derivatives. Therefore, this route is not feasible for a high-yield synthesis. The acetyl group must be introduced earlier.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Add the nitro group or the bromo group last.**\n        This means the synthesis must start with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene.\n        *   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone.\n            Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n            Now we have the acetyl group on the ring, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n        Now, we need to add the -Br and -NO2 groups to the meta positions (3 and 5). We have two choices for the next step: bromination or nitration.\n\n        *   **Path A: Brominate first, then nitrate.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Bromination.** Acetophenone is treated with Br2 and FeBr3. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be added at position 3.\n                Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3a: Nitration.** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has an acetyl group (m-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (o,p-director) at position 3.\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Both groups are deactivating. Electrophilic attack is generally disfavored at positions ortho to a deactivating group. Position 5 is meta to both substituents and is the least deactivated position. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at position 5.\n                3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                This sequence is chemically sound and known to produce the desired product in good yield.\n\n        *   **Path B: Nitrate first, then brominate.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Nitration.** Acetophenone is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 3.\n                Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3b: Bromination.** We now brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 (-COCH3) and 3 (-NO2). Both groups reinforce each other, directing the incoming bromo group to position 5.\n                3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                While this path also leads to the correct product, the ring in step 3b is more strongly deactivated (due to -NO2 being more deactivating than -Br) than the ring in step 3a. This would require harsher reaction conditions and likely result in a lower yield. Thus, Path A is the superior \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n4.  **Match the Best Strategy to the Given Options:**\n    The best synthesis route we identified is:\n    i) Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)\n    ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)\n    iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ... — Incorrect start.\n    *   B) **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ... — The first three steps perfectly match our optimal synthesis route. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the target molecule, indicating a potential flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only one provided that correctly and efficiently leads to the desired product.\n    *   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... — This sequence starts by making benzene from benzene, which is incorrect.\n    *   D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... — This would lead to 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and subsequent acylation would fail or give the wrong isomer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B is the only choice that begins with the correct, high-yield sequence of reactions to produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Despite the superfluous steps listed afterward, the core of the synthesis presented is the most valid among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: all three groups are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (Relevant for intermediates in some options).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it can logically produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Sequence A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene:** Nitration of benzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2). The -NH2 group is strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This step is highly problematic. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-N+H2-AlCl3), which prevents the desired reaction on the ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence B:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** Bromination of benzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene -> o/p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (4-bromonitrobenzene) being the major one. This does not lead to a *meta* relationship between Br and NO2.\n    3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on this ring is very difficult because it is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Even if it worked, the directing effects would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n    3.  **Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride:** Diazotization of aniline.\n    4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene:** Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 removes the group entirely, regenerating the starting material, benzene. This sequence is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Sequence D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom is added at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is an electrophilic nitration on 3-bromoacetophenone. We must consider the directing effects of both substituents:\n        *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        At first glance, the directors seem to conflict. However, the -COCH3 group is a strong deactivator, making the positions *ortho* and *para* to it (positions 2, 4, 6) very unreactive. The least deactivated position on the ring is position 5 (meta to the strong deactivator). Therefore, the nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, yielding the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This reaction is known to proceed with a good yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the desired product if carried out, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product. This implies that the correct path is contained within the option.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D correctly outlines the steps to first install a *meta*-director (acetyl group), then use it to direct the second substituent (bromo group) to the meta position, and finally, perform a third substitution (nitration) which is directed to the only remaining favorable position to give the 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are **meta** (in a 1,3,5 relationship) to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent influences the position of subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring is challenging, especially when one of the substituents is an ortho, para-director (-Br) and the other two are meta-directors (-COCH3, -NO2). A direct sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work efficiently.\n*   If we try to add the three groups directly, their directing effects will conflict. For example, if we have a 1,3-disubstituted ring with a meta-director and an o,p-director, the third substituent will likely lead to a mixture of products.\n*   Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH3 group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. This means the acylation step must happen before nitration, or an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nThe presence of steps like reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy involving the use of a temporary amino group (-NH2) to control the regiochemistry. The amino group can be introduced by reducing a nitro group, and it can be removed completely after it has served its directing purpose.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\niii) Product from (ii) + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitro-substituted benzene ring. The reaction is extremely slow or fails due to the strong deactivating effect of the nitro group. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) Aniline → Diazonium salt\niv) Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination). This sequence just regenerates the starting material, benzene, and then proceeds with further reactions on it, which is nonsensical. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. If it were to proceed, it would likely yield the meta product (3-aminoacetophenone), but it's not a standard, high-yield reaction. Assuming it works and gives 3-aminoacetophenone:\niv) 3-aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → The powerful activating -NH2 group directs ortho/para. Under acidic conditions (FeBr3 is a Lewis acid), the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -COCH3 group is also a meta-director. Starting with substituents at C1 and C3, both direct to C5. So we would get 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone.\nv) Nitration of 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has three substituents: -NH3+ (meta), -Br (o,p), and -COCH3 (meta). The ring is extremely deactivated by two strong deactivators (-NH3+, -COCH3) making this nitration step very difficult, if not impossible. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs the strategy of using a temporary group to control regiochemistry.\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. (This adds the acetyl group early, avoiding issues with Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step is regioselective).\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitration**. Here, the directing effects conflict (-COCH3 is meta, -Br is o,p). This will produce a mixture of isomers, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. Crucially, the synthesis does not require this step to be selective. Let's call the product mixture **Isomer Mix**.\niv) Isomer Mix + Fe/HCl → **Reduction**. The nitro group in all isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have a mixture of 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. Let's call this **Amino Mix**.\nv) Amino Mix + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Second Nitration**. This is the key step.\n    *   In 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    *   In 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C6) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    This step is highly regioselective for both components of the mixture, yielding a mix of 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. The desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern is now established.\nvi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → **Diazotization**. The amino group (-NH2) in both isomers is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\nvii) Product from (vi) + H3PO2 → **Deamination**. The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Removing the group at C4 from the first isomer leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   Removing the group at C6 from the second isomer also leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    Both paths converge to the same final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis synthetic route is elegant because it doesn't rely on a difficult separation or a selective reaction in step (iii). Instead, it uses the initial nitro group as a \"sacrificial\" directing group that is later removed, ensuring a high overall yield of the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in Option A is the correct and most effective pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding -COCH3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with a -NO2 group is too deactivated. It also does not work on rings with an -NH2 group (aniline) because the amine is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst.\n*   **1,3,5-Substitution:** To achieve this pattern, we generally need to use *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitutions, or use a \"placeholder\" group that can be modified or removed later (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This successfully creates a 1,3 substitution pattern.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated overall. The reaction is known to proceed with good yield to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. **At this point, the target molecule has been synthesized.**\n*   The remaining steps (iv-vii) seem extraneous and chemically flawed (e.g., nitrating a sensitive aniline derivative), but the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n*   **Step iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) results in converting benzene back into benzene. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** The -Br group is *ortho, para*-directing, with the *para* product favored.\n*   **Step iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on aniline. The lone pair of the -NH2 group (a Lewis base) will react with the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule. The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The first three steps of Option A represent the most effective synthesis among the choices. The superfluous steps at the end are likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the acetyl group (-COCH₃) to position 1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is crucial, as each group directs the next incoming group to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director** due to its lone pairs participating in resonance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically leads to the 1,3,5 substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → This will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major). Neither of these has the required meta-relationship for building the final product. This pathway will not lead to a high yield of the target.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂), which is a strong activating group and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → This reaction does not work as intended. The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring fails.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a fundamentally flawed step.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization).\n*   **Step iv):** Benzenediazonium chloride + H₃PO₂ → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop and does not lead to the desired product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta position (C3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration. Now we must place the nitro group.\n    *   The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1, meta-director) and -Br (at C3, ortho, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, in such cases, we must also consider steric hindrance and the relative deactivating strengths. The positions ortho to the substituents (2 and ortho-part of 6) are sterically hindered. A detailed analysis shows that the least disfavored position is C5. Therefore, nitration occurs at position 5, yielding **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired product. This pathway is known to produce the target compound as the major product.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These subsequent steps (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) would modify and ultimately destroy the target molecule that was already successfully synthesized in step iii. These steps appear to be extraneous and are likely an error in the question's formatting. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in its initial steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or incompatible reactions. Despite the superfluous final steps listed in option D, it is the only choice that correctly describes how to build the molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Structure and Directing Effects:**\n    *   The substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n    *   -COCH3 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -Br is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider adding the three groups directly to benzene.\n*   **Problem:** It's very difficult to add three groups in a 1,3,5-pattern when they don't all direct to the same places. More importantly, Friedel-Crafts reactions, like the acylation needed to add the -COCH3 group (CH3COCl/AlCl3), fail on strongly deactivated rings. If we add the -NO2 and -Br groups first, the ring becomes too deactivated for the final acylation step.\n*   **Route 1:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (OK)\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a meta-director, so this works well).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → Target. (The -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are both meta-directors. They both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5. The regiochemistry is perfect).\n*   **Potential Flaw:** The final bromination step is performed on a ring with two deactivating groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This makes the ring very unreactive towards electrophilic substitution. While the selectivity is good, the reaction rate is very low, and standard conditions (Br2/FeBr3) give very poor yields (reported as ~11%). Achieving a \"high-yield\" requires very harsh, specific conditions not implied by the question's reagents. Therefore, this simple route is likely not the intended answer for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate Indirect Synthesis Routes (The \"Amino Group\" Strategy)**\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy. This strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing an amino group (-NH2), usually from a nitro group.\n2.  Using the powerful ortho, para-directing effect of the amino group (or its protected form, acetamido -NHCOCH3) to place other substituents.\n3.  Removing the amino group via diazotization and deamination.\n\nThis is a classic method for synthesizing substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each option to see if it follows a logical path to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone. Here, -COCH3 directs to position 5, but -Br (an o,p-director) directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directors are in conflict, which will lead to a mixture of products, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence just returns to the starting material, benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of p-Bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both -Br and -NO2 groups. This reaction fails. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's see if we can find a plausible (though complex) path that matches these reagents. The overall strategy must be the amino-group-directed synthesis. A successful, high-yield synthesis is as follows:\n    1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** (Matches steps **i** and **ii**).\n    2.  **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone.** This is a complex transformation. A possible way is protecting the aniline as acetanilide, performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (which gives the para product), and then deprotecting. Let's assume the single step **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3** is a shorthand for this entire process of getting the acetyl group onto the ring para to the amino group. The product is 4-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **4-aminoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** This is step **iv) Br2/FeBr3**. The directing effects are checked: The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group and the m-directing -COCH3 group both direct bromination to position 3. This is a reinforcing effect and works well.\n    4.  **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is step **v) HNO3/H2SO4**. For this to work in high yield, the powerful -NH2 group must direct the nitration to position 5 (ortho to itself). This requires non-acidic conditions to avoid protonating the amine to the meta-directing -NH3+. Assuming such conditions are implied, this step is plausible.\n    5.  **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazotize the -NH2 group.** This is step **vi) NaNO2/HCl**. This is the standard reaction.\n    6.  **Diazonium salt → Deamination (remove the N2+ group).** This is step **vii) H3PO2**. Removing the directing group at position 4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5. This yields the target product.\n\n    While the description of steps (iii) and (v) in option A is imprecise, the overall sequence of transformations represents a valid and high-yield synthetic strategy for this challenging target molecule. The other options contain fundamental flaws (failed reactions, incorrect regiochemistry, pointless loops). Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the provided reaction options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Let's number the ring starting from the acetyl group at C1. The bromo group is at C3, and the nitro group is at C5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nTo plan a synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group)**: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is relevant as it is formed by reducing a nitro group (Fe/HCl).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium ion)**: Formed from -NH2 in strong acid. Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nA critical rule in EAS is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. This means we cannot perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that already has a -NO2 group or other strongly deactivating groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating a \"Simple\" Direct Synthesis\nLet's first consider the most direct way to assemble the molecule. The Friedel-Crafts acylation must be done before the ring is strongly deactivated (i.e., before nitration).\n1.  **Acylation**: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  Now we need to add -Br and -NO2 to acetophenone at the meta positions (C3 and C5). Let's consider the two possible orders.\n    *   **Order A: Nitrate then Brominate**\n        a. **Nitration**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This works well.\n        b. **Bromination**: 3-Nitroacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -NO2 (at C3, m-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. The directing effects are **reinforcing**. This is an excellent synthetic step.\n        *This sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a highly efficient and logical route to the target molecule.*\n\n    *   **Order B: Brominate then Nitrate**\n        a. **Bromination**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n        b. **Nitration**: 3-Bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -Br (at C3, o,p-director). The directors are in **conflict**. -COCH3 directs to C5, while -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThe best simple route is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. However, none of the options list this sequence. This suggests we must evaluate the given, more complex options, which likely involve using a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) sequence points to this strategy. This sequence effectively replaces a -NO2 group with a -H atom, via an -NH2 intermediate.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Given Options\n\n*   **Option A**: i) Acylation; ii) Bromination; iii) Nitration... This follows Order B discussed above. It's plausible but potentially low-yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically flawed if they are to follow step (iii). For instance, step (v) involves nitrating a product that contains an unprotected amino group under strongly acidic conditions, which would either oxidize the amine or protonate it into a meta-director, leading to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option C & D**: Option C fails because step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, a strongly deactivated ring. This reaction does not work. Option D involves a circular sequence of steps (i-iv) that converts benzene back to benzene, making it nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option B**: Let's trace this pathway carefully. It employs the temporary directing group strategy.\n    i)   **Benzene → Nitrobenzene** (HNO3/H2SO4). Standard.\n    ii)  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline** (Fe/HCl). Standard reduction. The ring now has a powerful o,p-directing -NH2 group.\n    iii) **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This step is written as a Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline, which is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group. However, this sequence of reagents can be interpreted as a shorthand for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**, which moves the acetyl group from the nitrogen to the ring, predominantly at the para position. Let's assume this gives p-aminoacetophenone.\n    iv) **p-Aminoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone** (Br2/FeBr3). We brominate p-aminoacetophenone. The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group at C4 will direct the bromine to its ortho position, C3. This is a plausible step.\n    v)  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone** (HNO3/H2SO4). We nitrate the product from step (iv). Again, the powerful activating -NH2 group at C4 will direct the incoming -NO2 group to its other vacant ortho position, C5. (Note: In practice, the amino group would be protected as an amide to prevent oxidation and protonation, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, we assume the desired regiochemistry is achieved).\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt** (NaNO2/HCl). The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium group (-N2+).\n    vii) **Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (H3PO2). The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThe final product has the -COCH3 group at C1, -Br at C3, and -NO2 at C5. This matches the target molecule exactly. Although this path relies on a charitable interpretation of steps (iii) and (v), it is the only sequence provided that logically leads to the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically impossible steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the position of the acetyl group (-COCH3) as C1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at C3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other on the ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each substituent is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director. It is installed via bromination (e.g., Br2/FeBr3).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via nitration (e.g., HNO3/H2SO4).\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nThere are important rules and limitations in electrophilic aromatic substitution that must be considered:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO2 group). They also fail on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3).\n*   **Order Matters:** The order in which substituents are introduced determines the final substitution pattern, as each new substituent is directed by the groups already present on the ring.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> p-Bromonitrobenzene** (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group and also deactivated by the -Br group. The Friedel-Crafts reaction will not proceed or will give a very low yield. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.** The -NH2 group is strongly activating and an *o,p*-director.\n3.  **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the catalyst and the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   The first four steps are: Nitration -> Reduction to Amine -> Diazotization -> Deamination. This sequence (i-iv) takes benzene and converts it back to benzene, making these steps redundant and illogical.\n*   Let's look at the sequence starting from benzene for the relevant substitutions: v) Br2/FeBr3 followed by vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3.\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Bromoacetophenone** (major product) + o-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **p-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ???** Now we nitrate p-bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -Br at C4). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to C3, C5). The -Br group directs *ortho* (to C3, C5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. So, the product will be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** This is the Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acetyl group (-COCH3) is added, which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine will add to the meta position (C3). The structure is now correct for the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n    *   -Br (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, directing to C2, C4, C6.\n    In cases of conflicting directors where one is a strong *meta*-director (like -COCH3) and the other is a weaker *o,p*-director (like -Br), the position that is least deactivated will be attacked. The -COCH3 group strongly deactivates its *ortho* and *para* positions (C2, C4, C6), making C5 the most favorable site for electrophilic attack. This reaction is known to produce the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence C successfully produce the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) appear to be erroneous additions to the question, as they would modify the correct product into something else. However, among the given choices, Option C is the only one that contains a valid and high-yield pathway to the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions involves first introducing the *meta*-directing acetyl group, followed by sequential substitutions that are directed by the groups already on the ring to form the 1,3,5 pattern. Option C provides a valid synthetic route in its first three steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere's a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** at position 1. This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).\n    *   A **bromo group (-Br)** at position 3. This is a deactivating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. It is introduced by electrophilic bromination (Br2/FeBr3).\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).\n*   The substitution pattern is **1,3,5**. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring in the correct positions to achieve high yield. The order of reactions is crucial due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **Constraint on Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acetyl group (-COCH3) must be added to the ring before the nitro group, or at least when the ring is not yet strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's consider a direct approach by sequentially adding the groups.\n\n**Direct Synthesis Pathway (Hypothesis)**\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acylation.** Start with benzene and add the acetyl group. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Nitration.** Nitrate acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the meta position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This is a high-yield reaction.\n3.  **Step 3: Bromination.** Brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring now has two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -NO2 (meta). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. Their directing effects reinforce each other.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is heavily deactivated, making the reaction slow, it is very clean (regioselective) and should give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThis three-step synthesis (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is the most chemically sound and high-yield route. Now, we must check if any of the given options match this sequence or another valid sequence.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nAll options present a seven-step sequence involving a recurring set of reagents: CH3COCl/AlCl3, Br2/FeBr3, HNO3/H2SO4 (x2), Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2. The sequence `Fe/HCl` (reduces NO2 to NH2) followed by `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) and `H3PO2` (deamination) is used to remove an amino group, which suggests a complex synthesis using a temporary directing group. However, let's analyze the options as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    This sequence starts by nitrating benzene to nitrobenzene, reducing it to aniline, then diazotizing and deaminating it back to benzene. This is a pointless circle and therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `...ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This option attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction does not work. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-), which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `...ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This sequence produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product from i and ii) and then attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group. The FC acylation will not proceed in any significant yield. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard and effective first step.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step works well to produce the meta-brominated product.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Here, we are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. We have two directing groups: -COCH3 (meta-director, at position 1) and -Br (ortho-, para-director, at position 3). The -COCH3 directs to position 5. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directing effects are in conflict. This will result in a mixture of isomers, with the main products being 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. The desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone will be formed, but as a minor product. Therefore, this step does not lead to a *high-yield* synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Choice**\n\n*   Options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n*   The first three steps of Option C (`Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration`) can produce the desired molecule, although not in high yield due to the non-selective nitration in the third step.\n*   The optimal sequence (`Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination`) is not provided as an option.\n*   The steps following step (iii) in option C (`iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`) are nonsensical. They would involve reducing the product's nitro group, then attempting another nitration, and finally removing the newly formed amine, ultimately leading back to an earlier intermediate.\n\nGiven the choices, there appears to be a flaw in the question or the options. However, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" or \"least incorrect\" answer. Options B and D are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. Option A is circular. Option C, while not providing a \"high-yield\" route because of a single conflicting step, at least follows a sequence of individually plausible reactions that *can* lead to the formation of the target product. It's the most plausible synthetic logic among the choices, despite its significant drawbacks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests a specific strategy. To achieve this pattern with high yield, we should perform substitutions under the influence of *meta*-directing groups. The presence of an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) complicates things, so its introduction needs careful timing.\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration** of acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination** of 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are strong *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromo group to position C5. This reaction should be highly regioselective, giving the desired product.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule)\n\nThis ideal sequence of key reactions is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided to see which one matches or most closely resembles this ideal strategy. We'll focus on the order of introduction of the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups. We will also consider the additional steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   This sequence is Bromination → Nitration → Acylation.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group, making this reaction extremely difficult and low-yield. This option is not viable for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   This sequence is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing -COCH3 group correctly places the bromine at C3.\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here we have two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   The o,p-directing effect of the halogen typically overrides the meta-director. The positions activated by the halogen (C2, C4, C6) are kinetically favored over the highly deactivated C5 position (which is meta to both groups). This step would produce a mixture of isomers, with the desired 1,3,5 product being a very minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" route under standard kinetic control.\n    *   However, compared to other options, this sequence starts plausibly. Friedel-Crafts on nitro-compounds (Options A, C) is generally considered to fail. While step (iii) in B has regioselectivity issues, the reaction itself is feasible. The question's reference to \"high yield\" might imply thermodynamic control where the more stable 1,3,5-isomer could be favored, or it might be that this is the \"best\" flawed option.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and diazotization seem superfluous if the target is made at step (iii), suggesting they may be distractors or part of an convoluted and incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) ... ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...\n    *   This sequence attempts Acylation after Nitration and other steps. After steps (i) Nitration and (ii) Bromination, the intermediate would be 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation of 3-bromonitrobenzene fails for the same reason as in Option A: the ring is strongly deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration, reduction to aniline, then deamination back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A and C fail because they schedule a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated, nitro-substituted ring.\n*   Option D is a logically flawed sequence.\n*   Option B follows a sequence of reactions where each step is chemically possible, although the nitration step (iii) suffers from poor regioselectivity for the desired product under normal conditions.\n\nDespite the low yield of the specific isomer in step (iii), Option B represents the most plausible sequence among the given choices, as the other options contain steps that are generally considered to be non-viable. The ideal pathway (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a small permutation of Option B (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration). It's possible the question considers this route viable, perhaps assuming conditions that favor the thermodynamic 1,3,5 product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents:\n1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n-   -COCH3 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n-   -Br is a deactivating, ortho,para-directing group.\n-   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring often involves using a powerful directing group that is later removed or modified. A common strategy is to use an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong ortho,para-director, and then remove it at the end of the synthesis via a Sandmeyer-type reaction (diazotization followed by reduction). The presence of steps involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of the diazonium group with -H) in options A, B, and C suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene:** This is the standard nitration of benzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\nii) **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong ortho,para-director.\niii) **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** This step represents Friedel-Crafts acylation. Direct acylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex. However, it is possible to achieve this transformation. A common way is N-acylation to form acetanilide, followed by a Fries rearrangement to yield ortho- and para-aminoacetophenone. The para-isomer is usually the major product. Let's assume this step yields **p-aminoacetophenone** [1-(4-aminophenyl)ethan-1-one].\niv) **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> ?** Bromination. We now have two directing groups: -NH2 (at position 4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at position 1, m-director).\n    -   The -NH2 group directs bromination to its ortho positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The -COCH3 group directs bromination to its meta positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The groups are cooperative, so bromination will occur with high yield at position 3 (or 5, which is equivalent). The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\nv) **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. We now have three directing groups: -COCH3 (at 1, meta), -Br (at 3, o,p), and -NH2 (at 4, strong o,p).\n    -   -NH2 at C-4 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -COCH3 at C-1 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -Br at C-3 directs to C-2 and C-6.\n    -   The powerful activating -NH2 group and the meta-directing -COCH3 group both strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. Their influence overrides the weaker directing effect of bromine. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\nvi) **Diazotization --(NaNO2/HCl)-->** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\nvii) **Deamination --(H3PO2)-->** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This removes the amino group that was used to direct the substitutions.\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This synthetic pathway is logical and all steps contribute to the formation of the desired product in high yield.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** (-COCH3 is a m-director).\nii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** (-COCH3 directs Br to the meta position).\niii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. The ring has a -COCH3 group (meta-director) and a -Br group (o,p-director). The -Br group is a stronger director in terms of position, so nitration would primarily occur at positions 4 and 6 (ortho/para to bromine), not position 5 (meta to both). This step would not give the desired precursor in high yield. The rest of the sequence is nonsensical as it involves reducing the nitro group only to nitrate the ring again. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** (-Br is an o,p-director).\nii) **Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\niii) **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction is extremely slow and low-yielding. Furthermore, both -Br and -NO2 direct the incoming acetyl group to position 2 (ortho to Br, meta to NO2). This would form 1-(2-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone, where the acetyl and bromo groups are ortho, not meta as required in the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni-iv) **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene:** These steps just nitrate benzene and then remove the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Option A outlines a viable and strategic synthesis route that uses an amino group as a temporary directing group to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern required.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
