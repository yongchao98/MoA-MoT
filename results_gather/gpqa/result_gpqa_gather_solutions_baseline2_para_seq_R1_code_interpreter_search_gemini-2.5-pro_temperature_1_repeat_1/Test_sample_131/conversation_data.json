Analyze the requirements from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio). Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute a signal (or signals) for its aromatic protons, and the total number of protons represented by each of the two final singlets must be equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. All signals are singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbons (e.g., no ethyl or propyl groups). This rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets** (each integrating to 3H).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Since they are equivalent and adjacent, they behave as a single group and produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will show a **quartet** (CH2, 4H) and a **triplet** (CH3, 6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 alkyl quartet, 1 alkyl triplet. This is immediately ruled out as the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nLet's test the combination in each option to see if it matches the observed spectrum (2 aromatic singlets in 1:1 ratio; 3 alkyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and triplet.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1** integral ratio (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of **12H:6H:6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two aromatic protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). Therefore, they will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also unique. This gives a third **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent (ortho to each other). They will couple and split each other's signals, appearing as **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a -CH2- (methylene) and a -CH3 (methyl) group.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be split by the -CH3 protons into a **quartet** (4H total).\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be split by the -CH2- protons into a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies only aliphatic singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the two compounds in the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, as the other two options would produce signals (doublets, quartets, triplets) that are not observed. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches the spectral data.\n\n**Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second signal.\n        *   The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called isochrony) and overlap to form a single 6H signal.\n    *   This configuration (12H, 6H, 6H) perfectly matches the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets of 1H each.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio of 4H corresponds to two signals, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally isochronous, overlapping to form a second 2H signal at a different chemical shift.\n    *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that can produce the described spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other options are ruled out due to incorrect signal multiplicities (splitting patterns).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two different compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: There are two protons at C4 and C6. These are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is between a methyl and a hydrogen). They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as a **multiplet** (specifically, an AB quartet or a pair of doublets), not a singlet. This is a key point.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This would give two singlets of 6H each.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signals will be a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n**3. Use a Process of Elimination based on the Spectral Data**\n\nWe can now eliminate options based on the characteristics of the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are \"all singlets\". **1,4-diethylbenzene** produces a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The problem states that the aromatic signals are \"two singlets\". **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** has two adjacent aromatic protons, which would result in a multiplet, not a singlet. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**.\n\n**4. Confirm the Remaining Option**\n\nThe only remaining option is **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can produce the described spectrum.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states the mixture has \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture of these two isomers, the total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4H. A 1:1 ratio means each signal must integrate to 2H. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally isochronous\" (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single 2H singlet. The mixture would then show two 2H singlets (one from each compound), which perfectly matches the 1:1 ratio description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The problem states there are \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This perfectly describes the spectrum of pure **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   What about the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB? For the final spectrum of the mixture to have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's check the total integration. Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from the components:\n        *   Signal 1 (12H): This comes directly from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 2 (6H): This comes from the 6H singlet of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 3 (6H): This must be formed by the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB being accidentally isochronous and overlapping.\n    *   This explanation, while requiring two separate instances of accidental signal overlap, is the only one that logically fits all the data provided. Such simplifications are common in spectroscopy problems.\n\nThe process of elimination is the most straightforward path to the solution. The compounds that do not produce singlets in the specified regions can be immediately ruled out, leaving only one possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates a lack of adjacent, non-equivalent protons that would cause spin-spin splitting.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of methyl groups. They will produce **two alkyl singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two aromatic singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. One might expect four separate alkyl singlets. However, due to very similar electronic environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a quartet and the -CH3 group will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Option**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and alkyl regions is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1.

The formula is C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** A benzene ring (C6) with 2 ethyl groups (2 x C2H5) and 4 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4C4H10 = **C10H14**. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to predict the number of signals, multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and integration for the protons in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are not all equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl at 2 is unique.\n        *   Methyl at 5 is unique.\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 4 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The CH2 (methylene) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the 3 adjacent CH3 protons). Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The CH3 (methyl) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the 2 adjacent CH2 protons). Integration: **6H**.\n    *   Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**4. Analyze the Spectra of the Possible Mixtures:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's test the combination from option D, which involves the two compounds that seem most promising.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D):**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine their spectra for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 2H) and one singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 2H). Assuming they appear at slightly different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H) and two singlets from Compound 2 (relative intensities 6H and 6H). This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only one that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds, from a given list, corresponds to the described 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals. Both are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals. All are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nLet's analyze the molecular formula and structure of each option to predict its spectrum. All listed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons. Thus, they will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is adjacent to one methyl group, while the proton at C6 is flanked by two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct signals**. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be **singlets**, each corresponding to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the mirror plane). They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H. (While they are adjacent, their chemical equivalence in a symmetrical system simplifies the pattern to a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, similar to p-xylene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will appear as a **quartet** (split by the adjacent CH3), and the methyl (CH3) protons will appear as a **triplet** (split by the adjacent CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out immediately.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option, remembering it's a 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 2 singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** The spectrum would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB and a quartet and triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. This **does not match** the data, which specifies only three singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which two compounds, from a list of four, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on the provided 1H NMR spectrum data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds. This means that for every molecule of compound X, there is one molecule of compound Y.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons do not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates the protons of the alkyl groups are not coupled to other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to a CH or CH2 group, or an ethyl group where coupling is not resolved or absent.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 is unique, and the proton at position 6 is unique. They are not adjacent. This will result in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2 is unique (3H); the one at C5 is unique (3H); and the ones at C1 and C3 are equivalent to each other (6H). This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, which would normally create a doublet. However, because they are chemically equivalent, they behave as a singlet in many common cases (an AA' system) or a more complex pattern. Given the simple data, it's most likely treated as a singlet for this level of problem. Assuming they appear as a singlet due to equivalence, this gives a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: those at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H), and those at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, creating a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons, creating a **triplet (6H)**. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately **ruled out**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixtures Based on the Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data. We need a combination that results in 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. Total: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. Total: **Three singlets**. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is invalid because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** (or two if there's accidental overlap), with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only combination that produces an NMR spectrum consistent with the experimental data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Structure of Candidates**\nThe molecular formula C10H14 has a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4`), which corresponds to a substituted benzene ring.\nThe substituents must account for C4H8.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The four methyl groups (4 x CH3) are C4H12. This doesn't match C4H8. Let's recalculate. The benzene core is C6. The substituents are C4H14. This is consistent with four methyl groups (C4H12) on a C6H2 ring (total C10H14) or two ethyl groups (C4H10) on a C6H4 ring (total C10H14).\n\nLet's examine the 1H NMR spectrum predicted for each option based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1-Me and C3-Me are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   C5-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not a singlet. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The ethyl group protons (CH2 and CH3) are not singlets. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons into a triplet. The problem explicitly states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n### **3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\n*   The aromatic region shows two separate singlets. This means the mixture must contain two different compounds, and *each* must produce a single singlet in its aromatic spectrum.\n*   Based on our analysis in step 2, only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** fit this criterion. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would give doublets, and 1,4-diethylbenzene has been ruled out by the aliphatic signals.\n*   Therefore, the two compounds must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### **4. Verify the Aliphatic Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds produces the observed aliphatic spectrum.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes one singlet of 12H intensity.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n\nThe problem states the final spectrum of the mixture shows **three signals** with a ratio of **2:1:1**. This implies that some of the signals from the individual compounds overlap (are accidentally degenerate) in the mixture's spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals from the 1:1 mixture:\n1.  A singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H).\n2.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 6H).\n3.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n4.  Another singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n\nTo get only three signals, two of these must overlap. The most plausible scenario that fits the 2:1:1 ratio is if the two 3H signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** are accidentally degenerate (i.e., they have the same chemical shift).\n\nIf this overlap occurs, the signals in the mixture's spectrum would be:\n*   **Signal 1:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H (from C1/C3-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 3:** 3H + 3H = 6H (from the overlapped C2- and C5-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n\nThe integration ratio of these three signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\nThis perfectly matches the experimental data provided in the problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe two compounds in the 1:1 mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this.\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two of these compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are looking at a mixture of two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the aromatic protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This happens when the adjacent carbons are substituted (have no protons).\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that for each molecule of compound A, there is one molecule of compound B, and the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 1 is equal to the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 2.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   \"Three signals\" is the total number of unique aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the signals are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not coupled to other protons. This is typical for methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" tells us the relative number of protons in each of these three environments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number and type of signals for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  CH3 at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other and will couple. This technically produces an AB quartet or a more complex multiplet. But in many cases, especially with low-resolution spectra, if the chemical shift difference is zero, it can be simplified or appear as **one singlet (2H)**. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets (6H, 6H)**, which is a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent and will appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 will be a quartet and the CH3 will be a triplet. Since the problem specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures Given in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's analyze the valid options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is ruled out.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals would come from Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) and Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a total of up to 5 signals, which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this produces two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. (This part fits).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four aliphatic signals. This does not match the observed three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This option perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem description without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that directly accounts for all the observed signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify which pair of compounds, from the given options and in a 1:1 mixture, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals.\n    *   Both signals are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons that are not equivalent to each other. Each type gives a singlet, meaning its protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each singlet must arise from the same number of protons in its respective molecule.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are three signals.\n    *   All signals are singlets. This indicates the protons (likely from methyl groups) are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Let the total number of aliphatic protons be 'N'. The three signals represent groups of protons in the ratio of (2/4)*N, (1/4)*N, and (1/4)*N.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all candidates have the molecular formula C10H14. All four are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, with the formula C6H2(CH3)4 or C6H4(C2H5)2, both of which are C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry), all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent.\n    *   This also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets with an integration of 6H (from Me-1 + Me-3), 3H (from Me-2), and 3H (from Me-5). The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Such an A2 (or more accurately, AA') system appears as a singlet.\n    *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Two singlets, one for Me-1+Me-4 (6H) and one for Me-2+Me-3 (6H). The ratio is 6:6 or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 and CH3 protons within the ethyl group are not equivalent and will couple.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One quartet (4H, from the -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, from the -CH3-). This does not match the data stating all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and so can option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum is the sum of the spectra of the two components. We need a combination that gives **two aromatic singlets** (1:1 ratio) and **three aliphatic singlets** (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nSince 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,5-TMB, and 1,2,3,4-TMB all produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region, any 1:1 mixture of two of these will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming slightly different chemical shifts, which is expected). So, the deciding factor will be the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's examine the aliphatic signals for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet.\n    *   Total signals: up to 5 singlets. To get the observed 3 signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and specific signal overlap would be required. This is a complex and less likely scenario.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total signals: This combination naturally provides **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Total signals: four singlets. To match the observed spectrum, we would have to assume that the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally degenerate\" (have the exact same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from the overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it is an assumption.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option B) directly and simply explains all features of the observed NMR spectrum. It provides two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with an exact 2:1:1 integration ratio (12H:6H:6H) without needing to assume any accidental signal overlap. This is the most straightforward and chemically sound explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H (4 x 3H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. A proper analysis shows the following equivalences:\n        *   Protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two equivalent protons (H4, H6) will give one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups. This will result in three **singlets**.\n        *   Singlet 1: C1-CH3 and C3-CH3 (equivalent). Integration: 6H.\n        *   Singlet 2: C2-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n        *   Singlet 3: C5-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives another **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H, in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. It matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. Ethyl groups show a characteristic quartet (for the CH2) and triplet (for the CH3) pattern due to spin-spin splitting. They do not produce singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the experimental spectrum only shows singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the mixture based on the predictions:**\n\nWe have a 1:1 mixture. This means we add the spectra of two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces one aromatic singlet of integration 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different, which is expected), each corresponding to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H = 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio means the total integration (2+1+1=4 parts) is divided into signals with relative sizes of 2/4, 1/4, and 1/4.\n    *   Absolute integrations: (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**4. Test the remaining options:**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would result in at least 4 signals (if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, and two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data from the spectrum without requiring any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H singlets. This is four signals. To get three signals with the correct 12H, 6H, 6H integrations, the two 3H signals must accidentally have the exact same chemical shift (accidental isochrony) to appear as one 6H signal. While possible, the combination in option C explains the data directly and is therefore the much more likely answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed 1H NMR spectrum, which shows two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4), which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of the two compounds.\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals in both the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) and the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm). The signals are all described as singlets, which is a crucial clue about the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecules.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three distinct singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, producing a pair of **doublets** (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets, **Prehnitene can be eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent, producing a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Elimination**\n\n*   Options B and C include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene), which is incorrect because it would produce doublets in the aromatic region.\n*   Option A includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect because it would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n\nBy this process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n**4. Verify the Spectrum of the Mixture in Option D**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of Durene and Isodurene matches the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The first 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n        *   The second 6H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. For 4 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **2H and 2H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The first 2H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The second 2H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination strongly points to Option D. Verifying the combined spectrum of this mixture shows that it is fully consistent with the observed data, assuming two plausible instances of accidental signal overlap, a common phenomenon in NMR spectroscopy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n        *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **Options:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n2.  **Verify Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6C (ring) + 4C (methyls) = 10C. 2H (ring) + 12H (methyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is correct for all three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6C (ring) + 4C (ethyls) = 10C. 4H (ring) + 10H (ethyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is also correct.\n    All four compounds are isomers and fit the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound:**\n    This analysis focuses on symmetry to predict the number of signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent. This will produce a single **singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet contradicts the data, which states there are only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent, but because they are coupled to each other (and to the methyl groups differently), they are magnetically non-equivalent. This will lead to splitting. The signal will appear as an **AB quartet or a pair of doublets**, not as singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a non-singlet signal in the aromatic region contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates options **A** and **D**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Option:**\n    By elimination, the only remaining possibility is option **B**, which is a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two equivalent protons (H-3, H-6). This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl:** Four equivalent methyl groups. This gives **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two non-equivalent protons (H-4 and H-6). They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (1H each).\n        *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups based on their environment. The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the group at C2 is unique, and the group at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (which is a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture (Durene + Isodurene):**\n    Now, we combine the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see if it matches the experimental data, allowing for potential accidental overlaps of signals with very similar chemical shifts.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets.\n        *   **Observation:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H (from Durene) + (1H + 1H) (from Isodurene) = 4H. For two signals to have a 1:1 ratio, each must integrate to 2H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 is the 2H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 is a single 2H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Observation:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of alkyl protons is 12H (Durene) + (6H + 3H + 3H) (Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H means the signals must have integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 (relative intensity 2) is the 12H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 (relative intensity 1) is the 6H singlet from Isodurene.\n            *   Signal 3 (relative intensity 1) is a 6H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 3H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration also perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe process of elimination definitively rules out options A, C, and D. A detailed analysis of option B shows that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is fully consistent with all the information given in the 1H NMR spectrum, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Due to the high symmetry, they give a single signal, which is a **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). This signal integrates to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They give a **single singlet** (no adjacent protons) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, they are magnetically equivalent due to symmetry and thus appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals will not be singlets. The two equivalent CH2 groups will be a **quartet**, and the two equivalent CH3 groups will be a **triplet**. The problem statement specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, so this compound can be ruled out from any potential mixture.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (2 singlets) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **5 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As determined earlier, 1,4-diethylbenzene produces quartets and triplets, which contradicts the given data. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio**. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet, 12H) + Prehnitene (2 singlets, 6H+6H) -> This combines to **3 singlets** in total. The integration ratio would be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **4 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose 1:1 mixture is consistent with all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Data from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of the two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most restrictive pieces of information are that **all observed signals are singlets** and the specific integration patterns.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options provided.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. In principle, they should produce **four separate singlets**, each integrating to 3H. However, accidental equivalence (where signals overlap by chance) is very common for similar methyl groups, so we might observe fewer than four signals. Based on spectral databases (like SDBS), it often shows three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing an AB quartet or a pair of doublets, **not a singlet**. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3CH2):** The protons of the ethyl group will show spin-spin coupling. The CH2 group will be a **quartet**, and the CH3 group will be a **triplet**. These are not singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\n*   Options containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (B and D) are incorrect because this compound would show multiplets (not singlets) in the aromatic region.\n*   The option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene** (A) is incorrect because this compound would show a quartet and a triplet (not singlets) in the alkyl region.\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only **Option C** as the possible answer.\n\n**4. Verify Option C**\n\nLet's confirm if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** matches the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1 mole of 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1 mole of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Total aromatic protons = 2H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 2H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 4H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means each signal must integrate to 2H.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (2H):** The single singlet from the two equivalent protons of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   **Signal 2 (2H):** The two different 1H protons from 1,2,3,5-TMB must be *accidentally equivalent* (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single singlet with an integration of 1H + 1H = 2H.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. For a total of 24 protons, this corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (12H):** The single singlet from the four equivalent methyl groups of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   The remaining signals (6H and 6H) must come from the 12 protons of the four methyl groups in 1,2,3,5-TMB.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, let's carefully break down what the 1H NMR data tells us about the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity means that the aromatic protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This typically occurs when the adjacent carbons are substituted (e.g., with methyl groups).\n    *   Having \"two\" signals implies that the mixture contains two compounds, and each contributes its own distinct aromatic proton signal.\n    *   The \"1:1 integration ratio\" in a 1:1 molar mixture means that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity suggests the signals are from methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"three\" signals are the total number of unique methyl group environments in the mixture.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons in each of those three environments. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the absolute integrations are **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### 2. Predict the Spectrum of Each Individual Compound\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry. A common simplification in problems of this type is to assume that chemically equivalent protons, even if adjacent, produce a single singlet.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The alkyl signals would be a quartet and a triplet due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the data stating all alkyl signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion: 1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-3, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-5, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The methyl groups at C-1/C-4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C-2/C-3 are equivalent. **2 singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (H-4, H-6) are equivalent. **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups (C-1/C-3, C-2, C-5). **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\nWe need a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1)**.\n\n*   The aromatic spectrum works for a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each provides one 2H singlet, so a 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets (a 1:1 ratio).\n*   The deciding factor is the combination of alkyl signals. We are looking for a combination that produces exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining valid options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Durene (1,2,4,5-): **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Signals from Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-): **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** The mixture directly produces **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the data without needing any extra assumptions.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-): two 6H singlets.\n    *   Signals from Isodurene (1,2,3,5-): three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces a total of five signals. It does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Signals from Durene (1,2,4,5-): one 12H singlet.\n    *   Signals from Isodurene (1,2,3,5-): three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Alkyl Spectrum:** This combination produces a total of four signals. To match the observation, it would require the two 3H signals from Isodurene to accidentally have the same chemical shift, overlapping to form one 6H signal. While possible, Option A explains the data directly and is the more straightforward solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum directly and unambiguously matches the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the requirements from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio). Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute a signal (or signals) for its aromatic protons, and the total number of protons represented by each of the two final singlets must be equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. All signals are singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbons (e.g., no ethyl or propyl groups). This rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2.

There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.

They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets** (each integrating to 3H).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Since they are equivalent and adjacent, they behave as a single group and produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent.

This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will show a **quartet** (CH2, 4H) and a **triplet** (CH3, 6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 alkyl quartet, 1 alkyl triplet. This is immediately ruled out as the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nLet's test the combination in each option to see if it matches the observed spectrum (2 aromatic singlets in 1:1 ratio; 3 alkyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and triplet.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1** integral ratio (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of **12H:6H:6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two aromatic protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). Therefore, they will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also unique. This gives a third **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent (ortho to each other). They will couple and split each other's signals, appearing as **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a -CH2- (methylene) and a -CH3 (methyl) group.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be split by the -CH3 protons into a **quartet** (4H total).\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be split by the -CH2- protons into a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies only aliphatic singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the two compounds in the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, as the other two options would produce signals (doublets, quartets, triplets) that are not observed. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches the spectral data.\n\n**Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second signal.\n        *   The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called isochrony) and overlap to form a single 6H signal.\n    *   This configuration (12H, 6H, 6H) perfectly matches the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets of 1H each.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio of 4H corresponds to two signals, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally isochronous, overlapping to form a second 2H signal at a different chemical shift.\n    *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that can produce the described spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other options are ruled out due to incorrect signal multiplicities (splitting patterns).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two different compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: There are two protons at C4 and C6. These are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is between a methyl and a hydrogen). They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as a **multiplet** (specifically, an AB quartet or a pair of doublets), not a singlet. This is a key point.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This would give two singlets of 6H each.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signals will be a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n**3. Use a Process of Elimination based on the Spectral Data**\n\nWe can now eliminate options based on the characteristics of the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are \"all singlets\". **1,4-diethylbenzene** produces a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The problem states that the aromatic signals are \"two singlets\". **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** has two adjacent aromatic protons, which would result in a multiplet, not a singlet. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**.\n\n**4. Confirm the Remaining Option**\n\nThe only remaining option is **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can produce the described spectrum.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states the mixture has \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture of these two isomers, the total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4H. A 1:1 ratio means each signal must integrate to 2H. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally isochronous\" (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single 2H singlet. The mixture would then show two 2H singlets (one from each compound), which perfectly matches the 1:1 ratio description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The problem states there are \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This perfectly describes the spectrum of pure **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   What about the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB? For the final spectrum of the mixture to have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's check the total integration. Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from the components:\n        *   Signal 1 (12H): This comes directly from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 2 (6H): This comes from the 6H singlet of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 3 (6H): This must be formed by the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB being accidentally isochronous and overlapping.\n    *   This explanation, while requiring two separate instances of accidental signal overlap, is the only one that logically fits all the data provided. Such simplifications are common in spectroscopy problems.\n\nThe process of elimination is the most straightforward path to the solution. The compounds that do not produce singlets in the specified regions can be immediately ruled out, leaving only one possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates a lack of adjacent, non-equivalent protons that would cause spin-spin splitting.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of methyl groups. They will produce **two alkyl singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two aromatic singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. One might expect four separate alkyl singlets. However, due to very similar electronic environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a quartet and the -CH3 group will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Option**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and alkyl regions is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, 1,2,3,4-):** A benzene ring (C6) with 4 methyl groups (4 x CH3) and 2 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** A benzene ring (C6) with 2 ethyl groups (2 x C2H5) and 4 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4C4H10 = **C10H14**. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to predict the number of signals, multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and integration for the protons in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are not all equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl at 2 is unique.\n        *   Methyl at 5 is unique.\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The CH2 (methylene) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the 3 adjacent CH3 protons). Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The CH3 (methyl) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the 2 adjacent CH2 protons). Integration: **6H**.\n    *   Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**4. Analyze the Spectra of the Possible Mixtures:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's test the combination from option D, which involves the two compounds that seem most promising.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D):**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine their spectra for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 2H) and one singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 2H). Assuming they appear at slightly different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H) and two singlets from Compound 2 (relative intensities 6H and 6H). This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only one that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds, from a given list, corresponds to the described 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals. Both are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals. All are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nLet's analyze the molecular formula and structure of each option to predict its spectrum. All listed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons. Thus, they will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is adjacent to one methyl group, while the proton at C6 is flanked by two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct signals**. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be **singlets**, each corresponding to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the mirror plane). They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H. (While they are adjacent, their chemical equivalence in a symmetrical system simplifies the pattern to a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, similar to p-xylene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will appear as a **quartet** (split by the adjacent CH3), and the methyl (CH3) protons will appear as a **triplet** (split by the adjacent CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out immediately.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option, remembering it's a 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 2 singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** The spectrum would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB and a quartet and triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. This **does not match** the data, which specifies only three singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which two compounds, from a list of four, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on the provided 1H NMR spectrum data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds. This means that for every molecule of compound X, there is one molecule of compound Y.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons do not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates the protons of the alkyl groups are not coupled to other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to a CH or CH2 group, or an ethyl group where coupling is not resolved or absent.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 is unique, and the proton at position 6 is unique. They are not adjacent. This will result in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2 is unique (3H); the one at C5 is unique (3H); and the ones at C1 and C3 are equivalent to each other (6H). This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, which would normally create a doublet. However, because they are chemically equivalent, they behave as a singlet in many common cases (an AA' system) or a more complex pattern. Given the simple data, it's most likely treated as a singlet for this level of problem. Assuming they appear as a singlet due to equivalence, this gives a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: those at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H), and those at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, creating a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons, creating a **triplet (6H)**. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately **ruled out**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixtures Based on the Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data. We need a combination that results in 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. Total: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. Total: **Three singlets**. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is invalid because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** (or two if there's accidental overlap), with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only combination that produces an NMR spectrum consistent with the experimental data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Structure of Candidates**\nThe molecular formula C10H14 has a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4`), which corresponds to a substituted benzene ring.\nThe substituents must account for C4H8.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The four methyl groups (4 x CH3) are C4H12. This doesn't match C4H8. Let's recalculate. The benzene core is C6. The substituents are C4H14. This is consistent with four methyl groups (C4H12) on a C6H2 ring (total C10H14) or two ethyl groups (C4H10) on a C6H4 ring (total C10H14).\n\nLet's examine the 1H NMR spectrum predicted for each option based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1-Me and C3-Me are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   C5-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not a singlet. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The ethyl group protons (CH2 and CH3) are not singlets. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons into a triplet. The problem explicitly states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n### **3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\n*   The aromatic region shows two separate singlets. This means the mixture must contain two different compounds, and *each* must produce a single singlet in its aromatic spectrum.\n*   Based on our analysis in step 2, only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** fit this criterion. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would give doublets, and 1,4-diethylbenzene has been ruled out by the aliphatic signals.\n*   Therefore, the two compounds must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### **4. Verify the Aliphatic Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds produces the observed aliphatic spectrum.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes one singlet of 12H intensity.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n\nThe problem states the final spectrum of the mixture shows **three signals** with a ratio of **2:1:1**. This implies that some of the signals from the individual compounds overlap (are accidentally degenerate) in the mixture's spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals from the 1:1 mixture:\n1.  A singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H).\n2.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 6H).\n3.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n4.  Another singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n\nTo get only three signals, two of these must overlap. The most plausible scenario that fits the 2:1:1 ratio is if the two 3H signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** are accidentally degenerate (i.e., they have the same chemical shift).\n\nIf this overlap occurs, the signals in the mixture's spectrum would be:\n*   **Signal 1:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H (from C1/C3-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 3:** 3H + 3H = 6H (from the overlapped C2- and C5-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n\nThe integration ratio of these three signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\nThis perfectly matches the experimental data provided in the problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe two compounds in the 1:1 mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this.\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two of these compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are looking at a mixture of two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the aromatic protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This happens when the adjacent carbons are substituted (have no protons).\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that for each molecule of compound A, there is one molecule of compound B, and the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 1 is equal to the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 2.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   \"Three signals\" is the total number of unique aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the signals are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not coupled to other protons. This is typical for methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" tells us the relative number of protons in each of these three environments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number and type of signals for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  CH3 at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other and will couple. This technically produces an AB quartet or a more complex multiplet. But in many cases, especially with low-resolution spectra, if the chemical shift difference is zero, it can be simplified or appear as **one singlet (2H)**. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets (6H, 6H)**, which is a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent and will appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 will be a quartet and the CH3 will be a triplet. Since the problem specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures Given in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's analyze the valid options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is ruled out.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals would come from Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) and Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a total of up to 5 signals, which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this produces two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. (This part fits).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four aliphatic signals. This does not match the observed three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This option perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem description without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that directly accounts for all the observed signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify which pair of compounds, from the given options and in a 1:1 mixture, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals.\n    *   Both signals are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons that are not equivalent to each other. Each type gives a singlet, meaning its protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each singlet must arise from the same number of protons in its respective molecule.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are three signals.\n    *   All signals are singlets. This indicates the protons (likely from methyl groups) are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Let the total number of aliphatic protons be 'N'. The three signals represent groups of protons in the ratio of (2/4)*N, (1/4)*N, and (1/4)*N.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all candidates have the molecular formula C10H14. All four are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, with the formula C6H2(CH3)4 or C6H4(C2H5)2, both of which are C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry), all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent.\n    *   This also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets with an integration of 6H (from Me-1 + Me-3), 3H (from Me-2), and 3H (from Me-5). The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Such an A2 (or more accurately, AA') system appears as a singlet.\n    *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Two singlets, one for Me-1+Me-4 (6H) and one for Me-2+Me-3 (6H). The ratio is 6:6 or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 and CH3 protons within the ethyl group are not equivalent and will couple.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One quartet (4H, from the -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, from the -CH3-). This does not match the data stating all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and so can option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum is the sum of the spectra of the two components. We need a combination that gives **two aromatic singlets** (1:1 ratio) and **three aliphatic singlets** (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nSince 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,5-TMB, and 1,2,3,4-TMB all produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region, any 1:1 mixture of two of these will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming slightly different chemical shifts, which is expected). So, the deciding factor will be the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's examine the aliphatic signals for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet.\n    *   Total signals: up to 5 singlets. To get the observed 3 signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and specific signal overlap would be required. This is a complex and less likely scenario.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total signals: This combination naturally provides **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Total signals: four singlets. To match the observed spectrum, we would have to assume that the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally degenerate\" (have the exact same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from the overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it is an assumption.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option B) directly and simply explains all features of the observed NMR spectrum. It provides two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with an exact 2:1:1 integration ratio (12H:6H:6H) without needing to assume any accidental signal overlap. This is the most straightforward and chemically sound explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H (4 x 3H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. A proper analysis shows the following equivalences:\n        *   Protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two equivalent protons (H4, H6) will give one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups. This will result in three **singlets**.\n        *   Singlet 1: C1-CH3 and C3-CH3 (equivalent). Integration: 6H.\n        *   Singlet 2: C2-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n        *   Singlet 3: C5-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives another **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H, in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. It matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. Ethyl groups show a characteristic quartet (for the CH2) and triplet (for the CH3) pattern due to spin-spin splitting. They do not produce singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the experimental spectrum only shows singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the mixture based on the predictions:**\n\nWe have a 1:1 mixture. This means we add the spectra of two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces one aromatic singlet of integration 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different, which is expected), each corresponding to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H = 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio means the total integration (2+1+1=4 parts) is divided into signals with relative sizes of 2/4, 1/4, and 1/4.\n    *   Absolute integrations: (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**4. Test the remaining options:**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would result in at least 4 signals (if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, and two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data from the spectrum without requiring any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H singlets. This is four signals. To get three signals with the correct 12H, 6H, 6H integrations, the two 3H signals must accidentally have the exact same chemical shift (accidental isochrony) to appear as one 6H signal. While possible, the combination in option C explains the data directly and is therefore the much more likely answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed 1H NMR spectrum, which shows two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4), which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of the two compounds.\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals in both the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) and the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm). The signals are all described as singlets, which is a crucial clue about the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecules.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three distinct singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, producing a pair of **doublets** (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets, **Prehnitene can be eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent, producing a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Elimination**\n\n*   Options B and C include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene), which is incorrect because it would produce doublets in the aromatic region.\n*   Option A includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect because it would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n\nBy this process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n**4. Verify the Spectrum of the Mixture in Option D**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of Durene and Isodurene matches the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The first 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n        *   The second 6H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. For 4 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **2H and 2H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The first 2H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The second 2H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination strongly points to Option D. Verifying the combined spectrum of this mixture shows that it is fully consistent with the observed data, assuming two plausible instances of accidental signal overlap, a common phenomenon in NMR spectroscopy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n        *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **Options:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n2.  **Verify Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6C (ring) + 4C (methyls) = 10C. 2H (ring) + 12H (methyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is correct for all three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6C (ring) + 4C (ethyls) = 10C. 4H (ring) + 10H (ethyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is also correct.\n    All four compounds are isomers and fit the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound:**\n    This analysis focuses on symmetry to predict the number of signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent. This will produce a single **singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet contradicts the data, which states there are only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent, but because they are coupled to each other (and to the methyl groups differently), they are magnetically non-equivalent. This will lead to splitting. The signal will appear as an **AB quartet or a pair of doublets**, not as singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a non-singlet signal in the aromatic region contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates options **A** and **D**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Option:**\n    By elimination, the only remaining possibility is option **B**, which is a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two equivalent protons (H-3, H-6). This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl:** Four equivalent methyl groups. This gives **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two non-equivalent protons (H-4 and H-6). They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (1H each).\n        *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups based on their environment. The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the group at C2 is unique, and the group at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (which is a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture (Durene + Isodurene):**\n    Now, we combine the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see if it matches the experimental data, allowing for potential accidental overlaps of signals with very similar chemical shifts.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets.\n        *   **Observation:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H (from Durene) + (1H + 1H) (from Isodurene) = 4H. For two signals to have a 1:1 ratio, each must integrate to 2H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 is the 2H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 is a single 2H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Observation:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of alkyl protons is 12H (Durene) + (6H + 3H + 3H) (Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H means the signals must have integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 (relative intensity 2) is the 12H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 (relative intensity 1) is the 6H singlet from Isodurene.\n            *   Signal 3 (relative intensity 1) is a 6H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 3H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration also perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe process of elimination definitively rules out options A, C, and D. A detailed analysis of option B shows that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is fully consistent with all the information given in the 1H NMR spectrum, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Due to the high symmetry, they give a single signal, which is a **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). This signal integrates to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They give a **single singlet** (no adjacent protons) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, they are magnetically equivalent due to symmetry and thus appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals will not be singlets. The two equivalent CH2 groups will be a **quartet**, and the two equivalent CH3 groups will be a **triplet**. The problem statement specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, so this compound can be ruled out from any potential mixture.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (2 singlets) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **5 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As determined earlier, 1,4-diethylbenzene produces quartets and triplets, which contradicts the given data. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio**. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet, 12H) + Prehnitene (2 singlets, 6H+6H) -> This combines to **3 singlets** in total. The integration ratio would be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **4 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose 1:1 mixture is consistent with all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Data from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of the two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most restrictive pieces of information are that **all observed signals are singlets** and the specific integration patterns.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options provided.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. In principle, they should produce **four separate singlets**, each integrating to 3H. However, accidental equivalence (where signals overlap by chance) is very common for similar methyl groups, so we might observe fewer than four signals. Based on spectral databases (like SDBS), it often shows three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing an AB quartet or a pair of doublets, **not a singlet**. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3CH2):** The protons of the ethyl group will show spin-spin coupling. The CH2 group will be a **quartet**, and the CH3 group will be a **triplet**. These are not singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\n*   Options containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (B and D) are incorrect because this compound would show multiplets (not singlets) in the aromatic region.\n*   The option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene** (A) is incorrect because this compound would show a quartet and a triplet (not singlets) in the alkyl region.\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only **Option C** as the possible answer.\n\n**4. Verify Option C**\n\nLet's confirm if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** matches the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1 mole of 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1 mole of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Total aromatic protons = 2H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 2H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 4H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means each signal must integrate to 2H.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (2H):** The single singlet from the two equivalent protons of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   **Signal 2 (2H):** The two different 1H protons from 1,2,3,5-TMB must be *accidentally equivalent* (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single singlet with an integration of 1H + 1H = 2H.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. For a total of 24 protons, this corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (12H):** The single singlet from the four equivalent methyl groups of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   The remaining signals (6H and 6H) must come from the 12 protons of the four methyl groups in 1,2,3,5-TMB. This means the four non-equivalent 3H singlets must pair up due to accidental equivalence.\n        *   **Signal 2 (6H):** Two of the 3H methyl singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have the same chemical shift.\n        *   **Signal 3 (6H):** The other two 3H methyl singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have the same chemical shift (but different from Signal 2).\n    *   This combination also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that fits the spectral data, allowing for plausible accidental chemical shift equivalences, is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
