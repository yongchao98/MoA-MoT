To solve it, we need to analyze the target molecule and consider the directing effects of the substituents, steric hindrance, and possible functional group interconversions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1: A strong activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2: A weak activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3: A strong deactivating group, meta director.\n\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe most striking feature is that the nitro group is *meta* to the strongly activating ethoxy group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) like nitration on a precursor containing the ethoxy group would strongly direct the nitro group to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests that either:\na) The group at position 1 was a meta-director during the nitration step.\nb) A blocking group was used to force nitration into the desired position.\nc) The nitro group was introduced by a non-EAS mechanism.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final steps. The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis, as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n*   **Final Step:** Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr or NaOEt).\n*   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (-OH, -tBu, -NO2). This is still a challenging synthesis. A powerful strategy for controlling substitution patterns is the use of a **blocking group**, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be introduced and later removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. A Plausible Synthetic Route**\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol starting from a simpler material like phenol (which can be made from benzene).\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** React phenol with a tert-butyl source (e.g., tert-butanol/acid or tert-butyl chloride/catalyst). This gives a mixture of *o*- and *p*-tert-butylphenol. We need the *ortho* isomer. Let's assume we can separate **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n3.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** React o-tert-butylphenol with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups are both ortho/para directors. They will both direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, meta to -tBu) and position 6 (ortho to -OH, ortho to -tBu). The para position (4) is sterically more accessible.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this intermediate with HNO3/H2SO4. The available positions are 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   -OH (position 1) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -tBu (position 2) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -SO3H (position 4) directs meta (to 3, 5).\n    *   All three groups direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is sterically hindered, being between the -OH and -tBu groups. However, it is electronically activated by both. Let's assume the reaction can be forced to yield the desired isomer.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-1-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** Heat the product from the previous step with dilute aqueous acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or H3O+/Heat). This removes the sulfonic acid group.\n    *   Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n6.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** React the phenol with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr).\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's see which option matches this logical pathway. The key strategic elements are the use of sulfonation/desulfonation as a blocking strategy and the final conversion of a phenol to an ether.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These sequences contain chemically impossible steps. Option A attempts diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro compound. Option B suggests nitrating a diazonium salt. Both are incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence does not effectively use a blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern and would likely lead to other isomers.\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nLet's analyze this option.\n*   It contains all the necessary reagents for the plausible synthesis outlined above: nitration, reduction, alkylation, diazotization, sulfonation, desulfonation (hydrolysis), and etherification.\n*   The final steps, **(viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat** followed by **(ix) NaOH/EtBr**, perfectly match the logical final steps of our proposed synthesis (desulfonation/hydrolysis to a phenol, then etherification).\n*   While the order of the preceding steps (i-vii) appears confusing and may contain typos or represent an alternative, highly complex pathway, the presence of the correct \"toolkit\" of reagents and the logical final steps make it the most plausible choice. The other options are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. The synthesis I outlined can be constructed by rearranging the steps in option C and using some reagents to first synthesize phenol from benzene (i, ii, v, viii).\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the only viable overall strategy, even if the sequence as written is problematic. It is the \"best\" answer among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The groups are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt is at C1, -tBu is at C2, and -NO2 is at C3.\n*   Relative positions: -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*; -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*; -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n\n**Analysis of Directing Effects:**\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with a nitro group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & B:** These sequences involve sulfonation and subsequent reactions. However, they contain steps in an illogical order. For instance, option A calls for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) at step (iv) when no primary aromatic amine has been formed. Option B calls for nitration of a diazonium salt at step (vi), which is not a standard transformation for this type of synthesis. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Even if the amine were protected (e.g., as an acetanilide), alkylation would predominantly occur at the para position, not yielding the necessary ortho-substituted product in high yield. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence represents a common and logical strategy in multi-step aromatic synthesis: introduce groups, modify their directing effects, and use them to place subsequent substituents correctly.\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield step.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**. This reaction changes the substituent from a meta-director to a powerful ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating amino group and the tert-butyl group both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine. This forms **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, giving **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the main framework is constructed. The final two steps listed in option D, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are redundant as they would add and then immediately remove a sulfonic acid group from the molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe synthesis outlined in steps (i) through (vii) of option D is a chemically sound, high-yield pathway. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule named in the question. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically flawed steps. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question prompt, and that the valid synthetic pathway presented in option D is the intended correct answer. It is the only sequence that follows a logical and high-yield synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The desired product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The key feature is the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:** We will examine each proposed reaction sequence to see if it is chemically logical and if it leads to the desired substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **Option A Analysis:**\n    *   `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This step is not efficient.\n    *   Furthermore, step `vi) SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt from step `v)` is not a standard reaction. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n4.  **Option C Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) immediately after `iii) SO3/H2SO4`. Diazotization requires an aromatic primary amine, which has not been formed at this stage. This sequence is out of order and incorrect.\n\n5.  **Option D Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration) on a diazonium salt formed in step `v)`. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n6.  **Option B Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it in detail.\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but sterically hinders the ortho position. The major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This yields **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at position 4 is an ortho,para-director.\n        *   The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs the incoming nitro group to C3 (which is ortho to it).\n        *   Both groups direct the substitution to the same position (C3). This leads to the formation of **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   Steps `viii)` and `ix)` (sulfonation and desulfonation) are redundant and do not alter the product from step `vii`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The sequence in Option B produces 1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. This is an isomer of the target molecule (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). However, Options A, C, and D contain chemically nonsensical steps. Option B describes a valid, albeit complex, synthesis pathway. It is the only chemically coherent choice, suggesting there is likely an error in the name of the target molecule in the problem statement.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relationship between the groups is:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects is crucial for planning the order of substitution reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-butyl (-tBu)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it favors *para* substitution.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2)** (as an intermediate): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Anilinium (-NH3+)** (formed from -NH2 in strong acid): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence**\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it's chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\niii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation. (Plausible)\niv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage, there is no amine group on the molecule.\nThis sequence is incorrect because the reagents are in the wrong order.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Plausible)\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Plausible)\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the nitrogen atom in the amino group. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid (major product). (Plausible)\niii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\niv) Fe/HCl: Reduction of nitro group → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\nv) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization → Diazonium salt. (Plausible)\nvi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; they would likely decompose.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nBy elimination, this should be the correct sequence. Let's analyze it carefully. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-substituted product is often challenging and may involve steps with low yields. We must determine if this path is at least chemically possible.\n\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\nii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is major due to sterics, but the *ortho* isomer (**1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To get the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the *ortho* isomer, even if it's a minor product.\niii) **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group. 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Standard reduction).\niv) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. We need to introduce the new nitro group at position 3 (relative to the final product numbering), which is *meta* to the anilinium group and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. While the directing effects are conflicting and the yield may be low, the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\nv) **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Standard reaction).\nvi) **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard reaction).\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the desired final product.\n\nSteps (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4 are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed. They might be included as red herrings or represent an error in the question's formulation. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the options that can chemically lead to the target molecule, even if some steps are not high-yield.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a chemically plausible (though not necessarily high-yield) route to the target product. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   Three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted or vicinal substitution pattern.\n*   The directing effects of the groups are:\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt is ortho to -tBu.\n*   -tBu is ortho to -NO2.\n*   -OEt is meta to -NO2.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, frequently involving blocking groups to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common final step for synthesizing an ether is the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This means the immediate precursor would be the corresponding phenol.\n*   **Final Step:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This matches step (ix) in option A: `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing the precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   The phenol group (-OH) is typically introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This is done with `H2O/Heat`. This matches step (vii) in option A.\n*   The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) using `NaNO2/HCl`. This matches step (v) in option A.\n\nThis suggests a strategy where we construct a complex aniline derivative, convert it to a phenol, and then to an ether. The sulfonic acid group (`SO3H`) is a common tool in such multi-step syntheses, acting as a blocking group and a directing group, which can be removed later by **desulfonation** (using `dilute H2SO4/Heat`). This matches step (viii) in option A.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed sequences based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and causing meta-alkylation. This is not a clean or efficient method. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Both start with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` to make tert-butylbenzene, followed by `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration).\n    Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. The para-isomer is major (~70-80%), but the ortho-isomer is also formed. A synthesis that starts with a mixture is generally not considered \"high-yield\". Furthermore, Option C has an impossible step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` on a molecule without an amino group. Option B proceeds to nitrate an aniline derivative directly (`iv) HNO3/H2SO4`), which is a very messy reaction prone to oxidation and poor control. Thus, B and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail, as it seems the most promising.\n\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n       *   Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    ii) **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible para position. This is a high-yield, regioselective step. This is a classic use of a blocking group.\n\n    iii) **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (position 2, which is ortho to -tBu and meta to -SO3H). This is another high-yield, regioselective step.\n\n    iv) **... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    v) **... + NaNO2/HCl → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium chloride.**\n       *   Diazotization of the amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    At this point, we have a diazonium salt with the substituents correctly positioned for further manipulation. The subsequent steps are confusingly written but represent the necessary transformations to reach the final product.\n\n    vi) **... + HNO3/H2SO4**\n       *   This step is the most confusing. It is likely a typo or represents a more complex transformation. A plausible interpretation in the context of a complex synthesis puzzle is a second nitration. The existing groups (-N2+, -tBu, -SO3H) would all direct an incoming electrophile to position 6. Let's assume this happens.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n    vii) **... + H3O+, H2O/Heat**\n       *   This step converts the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfophenol**.\n\n    viii) **... + dilute H2SO4**\n       *   This step is desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group.\n       *   Product: **3-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrophenol**. This is not the correct precursor.\n\n    **Revisiting the Logic:**\n    Despite the confusing final steps, the initial sequence of Option A (i, ii, iii) is the most logical and efficient way to create a specific trisubstituted intermediate from benzene in high yield. The other options have clear flaws in their early steps (creating mixtures or using problematic reactions). It is common in such problems for the correct option to represent the best overall strategy, even if it contains typos or obscure steps. The strategy in A is to use a para-blocking group (-SO3H) to force subsequent substitutions into specific positions, which is the correct approach for this type of target. The subsequent steps involve the correct types of reagents (for reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, and etherification) to convert the intermediate into the final product, even if their exact sequence or purpose as written is ambiguous. Given the clear flaws in B, C, and D, A remains the most plausible choice.\n\n    Let's assume a different, more logical sequence of the later steps that leads to the correct product, which the question author might have intended.\n    Starting from **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid** (product of step iv):\n    1.  Nitrate (this would be step vi). This requires protection of the amine, then nitration (which goes to position 3 or 5), then deprotection. Let's assume it goes to position 3. Product: **2-amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    2.  Diazotize the amino group (step v).\n    3.  Replace the diazonium group with -H (deamination, e.g., with H3PO2, a common reaction not explicitly listed but could be implied by the overall transformation). Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Replace the -SO3H group with -OH (e.g., by alkali fusion, another step not listed but necessary). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is the correct precursor.\n    5.  Etherify with NaOH/EtBr (step ix).\n\n    While this requires steps not listed, it shows that the intermediate from A(iv) can be converted to the target. The key is that the initial steps of A are the only ones that set up the regiochemistry correctly in a high-yield manner.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides the most chemically sound strategy for a high-yield synthesis, especially in the crucial initial steps that establish the substitution pattern. The other options involve steps that would lead to mixtures or are chemically infeasible. Therefore, despite the confusing nature of the later steps, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the proposed options is necessary, considering the directing effects of the substituents and the compatibility of the reactions.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. This 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded, and its synthesis requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts with the tert-butylation of benzene, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group is ortho, para-directing, but due to its large size, it primarily directs incoming groups to the para position. This would lead to 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene, making it difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Analysis of Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) would react with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this pathway is not viable.\n*   **Analysis of Option C:** This route involves using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group. After tert-butylation, sulfonation occurs at the para position. Subsequent nitration would be directed to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group. This leads to a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate, which is not the correct isomer for the final product.\n*   **Analysis of Option D:** This sequence presents the most chemically sound, albeit complex, route to the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, the ortho isomer is required, which would need to be separated.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a critical step. In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. This is a known strategy for synthesizing such substitution patterns. The desired 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is formed, along with the 5-nitro isomer.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D appear to be extraneous, but the core sequence from (i) to (vii) correctly and logically produces the desired compound. This makes Option D the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine a logical synthetic strategy.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   They are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   -OEt is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards):**\n\n1.  **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is typically added last via a Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr) on the corresponding phenol. The immediate precursor is therefore **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Phenol Formation:** A common way to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (e.g., adding H₃O⁺/H₂O and heat). The precursor for this step would be the diazonium salt derived from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Diazonium Salt Formation:** This is achieved by treating an aniline with nitrous acid (NaNO₂/HCl). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the most challenging step, as it requires establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Let's analyze the options to see how this might be achieved. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex; the powerful amino group directs ortho and para (to positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. A more controlled method is needed.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options based on fundamental principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii) on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring would fail or give a very low yield. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically illogical. Step (iv) is the diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires an amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (Fe/HCl reduction). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also illogical. An amine is formed in step (iv) and converted to a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt, which is not a standard or viable reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we must follow the major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This converts p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation, a step often implied in such problems). The directing effect of the resulting acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is still strongly ortho-directing. Nitration will occur at the position ortho to the amine/acetamido group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after deprotection).\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline to form a **diazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, resulting in **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and appear to be extraneous.\n\nWhile steps (i) through (vii) of option B outline a coherent synthesis, they produce an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the desired product. The other options (A, C, D) contain fundamental flaws in their reaction order. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that contains a plausible (though flawed) multi-step synthetic sequence. It is highly likely that there is an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the listed steps. However, among the given choices, B represents the most chemically reasonable sequence, despite its inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a thorough analysis of each proposed route is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the viability of each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options:\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, while the desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is the minor product. This step already compromises the \"high-yield\" objective.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene gives 2-(tert-butyl)aniline.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Crucially, both the -NH3+ group (at C1) and the -tBu group (at C2) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. This reaction can produce the required 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline, although likely as a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline forms a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, forming the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4:** These final two steps, sulfonation and desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.\n\nDespite the low-yield steps and the extraneous final steps, this sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct product structure.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence introduces a blocking group (-SO3H) but contains a chemically incorrect step: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt is not a standard transformation. The overall order of reactions is also illogical for producing the target molecule.\n\n**Option C:** This option is flawed at step `iv) NaNO2/HCl`, which attempts to form a diazonium salt from a substrate that does not contain an amino group.\n\n**Option D:** This sequence fails at step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A is the only sequence that presents a chemically viable, albeit not high-yielding, pathway to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Therefore, despite its imperfections, Option A is the best choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a vicinal (1,2,3) trisubstituted benzene. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nSynthesizing such a sterically crowded molecule with this specific electronic arrangement requires a carefully planned multi-step synthesis, often involving blocking groups or building the molecule from a precursor where the directing effects align favorably.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's think backward from the product (retrosynthesis).\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (from a phenol) with an alkyl halide.\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   Reaction: Deprotonation with a base (like NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   This corresponds to the reagent `NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** Our main challenge is to synthesize the precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Key Intermediate:** How can we make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol? Let's consider adding the substituents to a simpler ring.\n    *   **Path A: Start with m-nitrophenol and add a tert-butyl group.**\n        *   In m-nitrophenol (OH at C1, NO2 at C3), we need to add a t-Bu group at C2.\n        *   Let's check the directing effects for Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\n            *   The -OH group is a strong activator and directs *ortho* (to C2, C6) and *para* (to C4).\n            *   The -NO2 group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n            *   The powerful -OH group controls the reaction. It directs the incoming electrophile (the t-butyl cation) to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   Alkylation at position 2 gives the desired product: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. While a mixture with 4- and 6-alkylated products is expected, this is a plausible way to form the required C-C bond at the correct position.\n\n    *   **Path B: Start with 2-tert-butylphenol and add a nitro group.**\n        *   In 2-tert-butylphenol (OH at C1, tBu at C2), we need to nitrate at C3.\n        *   Directing effects for nitration:\n            *   -OH directs *ortho* (C6) and *para* (C4).\n            *   -tBu directs *ortho* (C3) and *para* (C5).\n            *   The -OH group is a much stronger activator than -tBu and will dominate, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. This path will not yield the desired 3-nitro product.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Path A is the more plausible route. The synthesis should proceed through m-nitrophenol.\n\n**3. Construct the Full Synthesis from Benzene**\n\nNow, let's build the full sequence, starting from benzene, to get to the final product via Path A.\n\n*   **Step 1: Synthesis of m-Nitrophenol from Benzene.**\n    This is a standard textbook synthesis:\n    a.  **Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    b.  **Second Nitration:** Nitrobenzene is nitrated again under harsher conditions. The -NO2 group is a meta-director, so this forms m-dinitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    c.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups in m-dinitrobenzene is selectively reduced to an amino group using a reagent like Na2S or (NH4)2S. The options provide `Fe/HCl`, which typically reduces all nitro groups, but for the sake of a multiple-choice question, we may have to assume it can be controlled or it's the intended reagent for reduction. This step yields m-nitroaniline. (Reagent: `Fe/HCl`)\n    d.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of m-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. (Reagent: `NaNO2/HCl`)\n    e.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in an aqueous acidic solution to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming m-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation of m-Nitrophenol.**\n    f.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** m-Nitrophenol is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst to introduce the tert-butyl group. As determined earlier, this can yield the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n\n*   **Step 3: Etherification.**\n    g.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base with NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `NaOH/EtBr`)\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis with the Given Options**\n\nLet's see which option provides the necessary reagents for this 7-step synthesis. The required reagents are:\n`HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n*   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n*   D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed synthesis:\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (listed twice, as ii and ix)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (listed as viii)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (listed as iv)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (listed as vi)\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (listed as i)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (listed as vii)\n\nThe other options are missing key reagents or include steps that lead to the wrong isomer. For example, Option C involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii), which is not a feasible reaction. Options B and D, through logical application of their steps, would lead to 1,2,4- or 1,3,4-substituted isomers, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAlthough the sequence of reactions in Option A is written in a scrambled and incorrect order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required for a plausible (though complex) synthesis of the target molecule. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and identify the substituents and their relative positions.\n\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is sterically crowded.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents direct incoming groups:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which influences regioselectivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Could the last step be nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The powerful activating -OEt group would direct nitration to its para position (C4) and ortho position (C6). The desired C3 position is meta to the -OEt group, so this would be a very minor product. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, the bulky tert-butyl group would preferentially add to the least sterically hindered position (likely C4 or C6), not the highly hindered C2 position between two existing groups. Also, Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be ether formation?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. The conversion of a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt) using Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH to form the phenoxide, followed by EtBr) is a standard, high-yield reaction. This is a very plausible final step.\n    *   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr** is consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize the precursor, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**?\nA common way to make phenols is via the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is made from an aniline.\n*   Phenol Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   Reaction Sequence: ...-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H3O+/Heat)--> ...-OH.\n    *   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl** and **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat** are consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**?\nLet's renumber this molecule for easier synthetic planning: 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. This has the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. It is very difficult to create this pattern by direct substitution onto a simple benzene derivative.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options, as they must contain the correct (or most plausible) path. The options seem to have typos and extra steps, so we must focus on the core chemical transformations.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Option A & B:** Contain chemically illogical steps, such as attempting diazotization on a molecule without an amine group (A) or nitrating a diazonium salt (B). These are incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic; it typically requires protection of the amine or occurs on the anilinium ion (meta-directing). Neither route easily leads to the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern after subsequent nitration.\n*   **Option D:** This option seems the most promising, despite its confusing structure. Let's analyze the sequence of transformations it suggests, even if the order or completeness is flawed.\n\n**5. Detailed Analysis of the most plausible pathway (based on reagents in Option D)**\n\nA viable, albeit complex, route to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this pattern involves dinitration followed by selective reduction. Let's see if the reagents in Option D fit this path.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n3.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. Nitrating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (C1-tBu, C2-NO2). Both the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -NO2 group (m-directing) direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6. This gives a mixture of 2,4-dinitro- and **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's assume we can isolate the desired **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n4.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of a nitro group. In 2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene, the two nitro groups are equivalent. A controlled reduction (e.g., using (NH4)2S, but Fe/HCl can also be used) can reduce one of them to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. The amino group of 2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis. The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming **2-hydroxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH and then treated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ether, yielding **2-ethoxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nLet's check the name of this final product according to IUPAC rules. The priority for numbering is -OEt > -tBu > -NO2.\n*   The carbon with the -OEt group is C1.\n*   The adjacent carbon with the -tBu group is C2.\n*   The next carbon with the -NO2 group is C3.\nThe name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions described above successfully produces the target molecule. This sequence uses the reagents listed in Option D. Although the order of steps (iii) and (iv) is swapped in the option text and there are superfluous steps (viii, ix) listed at the end, Option D is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for a chemically plausible synthesis. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, despite its flaws, Option D represents the correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. A successful synthesis depends on introducing the substituents in the correct order, taking into account their directing effects and the chemical compatibility of the reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituents**\n\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the ortho position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Intermediates:** To introduce the -OEt group, a common strategy is to first create a phenol (-OH) and then perform a Williamson ether synthesis. A phenol can be made from an amino group (-NH₂) via a diazonium salt. An amino group is typically made by reducing a nitro group.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical validity:\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Valid)\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Valid)\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction **fails** when attempted on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents the alkylation reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because step (iii) is not a viable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: This reagent combination is used for diazotization, a reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt. The substrate from step (iii) is not an amine.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect because step (iv) is performed on an inappropriate substrate.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. (Valid)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This step proposes reacting the diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture. This is **not a standard or logical synthetic transformation**. The goal is to create a phenol to later form the ether, which is typically achieved by heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because step (vi) is chemically nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is a minor product, but it is formed. (Valid step)\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene to yield 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\niv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, yielding 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. (Valid step)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the corresponding phenol, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Valid)\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to a phenoxide by NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product. (Valid)\nviii) & ix): The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and would not be part of an efficient synthesis, but the core pathway from (i) to (vii) is chemically sound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A, while not ideal in terms of yield due to poor regioselectivity in some steps, represents the only chemically plausible pathway from start to finish among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nOf course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the desired product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n    *   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** Understanding how these groups influence further substitutions is crucial.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. However, it is very large (sterically bulky), which strongly hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **The Core Synthetic Challenge:** The main difficulty in this synthesis is placing a substituent *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will almost exclusively yield the *para* product due to steric hindrance. A successful synthesis must therefore use a specific strategy to overcome this.\n\n### **2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n#### **Option D: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) is an acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\n\n#### **Option B: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (the para product is major).\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction. **This reaction fails.** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n#### **Option C: Incorrect (Leads to the Wrong Isomer)**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As established, due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n3.  The rest of the synthesis would proceed from this 1,4-disubstituted (para) intermediate. It is impossible to rearrange this structure to the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This sequence would produce an isomer of the target molecule, but not the target molecule itself.\n\n#### **Option A: Correct Strategy**\nThis sequence employs a clever and necessary strategy using a **blocking group**.\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) adds to the sterically most accessible position, which is *para* to the tert-butyl group. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The purpose of this step is to **block** the para position.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now that the *para* position is blocked, the incoming nitro group is forced to go to a position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both existing groups direct the new substituent to this same position:\n    *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and since *para* is blocked, it directs *ortho*.\n    *   The -SO₃H group is a *m*-director, and it also directs to the position *ortho* to the -tBu group.\n    This step successfully creates an intermediate with the crucial *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the later steps (iv-ix) in option A appear jumbled and may contain typos, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the **only one** presented that correctly solves the main chemical problem of forcing substitution ortho to a bulky tert-butyl group. In multiple-choice chemistry questions, you must identify the sequence that contains the correct core strategy, even if the full sequence is imperfectly written.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful evaluation of each proposed reaction sequence, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the feasibility of each chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent groups: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt and -tBu:** Both are activating, ortho, para-directors.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The synthesis must correctly place these three groups next to each other. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that the chosen reactions must be highly regioselective and efficient.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as it is written.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is chemically out of order. For example, step (v) `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted before the necessary primary amine has been formed. Furthermore, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`) on aniline (formed in step ii). This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also chemically out of order and contains nonsensical steps. Step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires an amine, but the reduction to form an amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its steps carefully.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This step produces a mixture of isomers. Due to the large size of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). However, the desired **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** is also formed as a minor product. For the synthesis to proceed, this minor product must be carried forward. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" nature of the synthesis but is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    *   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is a complex step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting, and a mixture of products is likely. However, the formation of the desired **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\n    *   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol undergoes Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   *(Steps viii and ix are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed)*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the pathway described in Option C has steps (specifically ii and iv) that would result in mixtures and low yields, it is the **only sequence that is chemically plausible in the order presented and leads to the correctly named target molecule**. The other options (A, B, and D) contain fundamentally flawed steps or sequences that are chemically impossible. Therefore, despite the conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition, Option C is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"

To solve it, we need to analyze the target molecule and consider the directing effects of the substituents, steric hindrance, and possible functional group interconversions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1: A strong activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2: A weak activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3: A strong deactivating group, meta director.\n\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe most striking feature is that the nitro group is *meta* to the strongly activating ethoxy group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) like nitration on a precursor containing the ethoxy group would strongly direct the nitro group to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests that either:\na) The group at position 1 was a meta-director during the nitration step.\nb) A blocking group was used to force nitration into the desired position.\nc) The nitro group was introduced by a non-EAS mechanism.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final steps. The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis, as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n*   **Final Step:** Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr or NaOEt).\n*   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (-OH, -tBu, -NO2). This is still a challenging synthesis. A powerful strategy for controlling substitution patterns is the use of a **blocking group**, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be introduced and later removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. A Plausible Synthetic Route**\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol starting from a simpler material like phenol (which can be made from benzene).\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** React phenol with a tert-butyl source (e.g., tert-butanol/acid or tert-butyl chloride/catalyst). This gives a mixture of *o*- and *p*-tert-butylphenol. We need the *ortho* isomer. Let's assume we can separate **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n3.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** React o-tert-butylphenol with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups are both ortho/para directors. They will both direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, meta to -tBu) and position 6 (ortho to -OH, ortho to -tBu). The para position (4) is sterically more accessible.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this intermediate with HNO3/H2SO4. The available positions are 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   -OH (position 1) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -tBu (position 2) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -SO3H (position 4) directs meta (to 3, 5).\n    *   All three groups direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is sterically hindered, being between the -OH and -tBu groups. However, it is electronically activated by both. Let's assume the reaction can be forced to yield the desired isomer.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-1-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** Heat the product from the previous step with dilute aqueous acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or H3O+/Heat). This removes the sulfonic acid group.\n    *   Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n6.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** React the phenol with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr).\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's see which option matches this logical pathway. The key strategic elements are the use of sulfonation/desulfonation as a blocking strategy and the final conversion of a phenol to an ether.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These sequences contain chemically impossible steps. Option A attempts diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro compound. Option B suggests nitrating a diazonium salt. Both are incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence does not effectively use a blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern and would likely lead to other isomers.\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nLet's analyze this option.\n*   It contains all the necessary reagents for the plausible synthesis outlined above: nitration, reduction, alkylation, diazotization, sulfonation, desulfonation (hydrolysis), and etherification.\n*   The final steps, **(viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat** followed by **(ix) NaOH/EtBr**, perfectly match the logical final steps of our proposed synthesis (desulfonation/hydrolysis to a phenol, then etherification).\n*   While the order of the preceding steps (i-vii) appears confusing and may contain typos or represent an alternative, highly complex pathway, the presence of the correct \"toolkit\" of reagents and the logical final steps make it the most plausible choice. The other options are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. The synthesis I outlined can be constructed by rearranging the steps in option C and using some reagents to first synthesize phenol from benzene (i, ii, v, viii).\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the only viable overall strategy, even if the sequence as written is problematic. It is the \"best\" answer among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The groups are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt is at C1, -tBu is at C2, and -NO2 is at C3.\n*   Relative positions: -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*; -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*; -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n\n**Analysis of Directing Effects:**\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with a nitro group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & B:** These sequences involve sulfonation and subsequent reactions. However, they contain steps in an illogical order. For instance, option A calls for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) at step (iv) when no primary aromatic amine has been formed. Option B calls for nitration of a diazonium salt at step (vi), which is not a standard transformation for this type of synthesis. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Even if the amine were protected (e.g., as an acetanilide), alkylation would predominantly occur at the para position, not yielding the necessary ortho-substituted product in high yield. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence represents a common and logical strategy in multi-step aromatic synthesis: introduce groups, modify their directing effects, and use them to place subsequent substituents correctly.\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield step.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**. This reaction changes the substituent from a meta-director to a powerful ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating amino group and the tert-butyl group both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine. This forms **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, giving **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the main framework is constructed. The final two steps listed in option D, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are redundant as they would add and then immediately remove a sulfonic acid group from the molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe synthesis outlined in steps (i) through (vii) of option D is a chemically sound, high-yield pathway. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule named in the question. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically flawed steps. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question prompt, and that the valid synthetic pathway presented in option D is the intended correct answer. It is the only sequence that follows a logical and high-yield synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The desired product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The key feature is the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:** We will examine each proposed reaction sequence to see if it is chemically logical and if it leads to the desired substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **Option A Analysis:**\n    *   `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This step is not efficient.\n    *   Furthermore, step `vi) SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt from step `v)` is not a standard reaction. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n4.  **Option C Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) immediately after `iii) SO3/H2SO4`. Diazotization requires an aromatic primary amine, which has not been formed at this stage. This sequence is out of order and incorrect.\n\n5.  **Option D Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration) on a diazonium salt formed in step `v)`. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n6.  **Option B Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it in detail.\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but sterically hinders the ortho position. The major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This yields **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at position 4 is an ortho,para-director.\n        *   The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs the incoming nitro group to C3 (which is ortho to it).\n        *   Both groups direct the substitution to the same position (C3). This leads to the formation of **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   Steps `viii)` and `ix)` (sulfonation and desulfonation) are redundant and do not alter the product from step `vii`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The sequence in Option B produces 1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. This is an isomer of the target molecule (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). However, Options A, C, and D contain chemically nonsensical steps. Option B describes a valid, albeit complex, synthesis pathway. It is the only chemically coherent choice, suggesting there is likely an error in the name of the target molecule in the problem statement.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relationship between the groups is:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects is crucial for planning the order of substitution reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-butyl (-tBu)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it favors *para* substitution.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2)** (as an intermediate): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Anilinium (-NH3+)** (formed from -NH2 in strong acid): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence**\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it's chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\niii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation. (Plausible)\niv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage, there is no amine group on the molecule.\nThis sequence is incorrect because the reagents are in the wrong order.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Plausible)\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Plausible)\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the nitrogen atom in the amino group. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid (major product). (Plausible)\niii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\niv) Fe/HCl: Reduction of nitro group → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\nv) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization → Diazonium salt. (Plausible)\nvi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; they would likely decompose.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nBy elimination, this should be the correct sequence. Let's analyze it carefully. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-substituted product is often challenging and may involve steps with low yields. We must determine if this path is at least chemically possible.\n\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\nii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is major due to sterics, but the *ortho* isomer (**1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To get the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the *ortho* isomer, even if it's a minor product.\niii) **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group. 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Standard reduction).\niv) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. We need to introduce the new nitro group at position 3 (relative to the final product numbering), which is *meta* to the anilinium group and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. While the directing effects are conflicting and the yield may be low, the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\nv) **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Standard reaction).\nvi) **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard reaction).\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the desired final product.\n\nSteps (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4 are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed. They might be included as red herrings or represent an error in the question's formulation. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the options that can chemically lead to the target molecule, even if some steps are not high-yield.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a chemically plausible (though not necessarily high-yield) route to the target product. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   Three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted or vicinal substitution pattern.\n*   The directing effects of the groups are:\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt is ortho to -tBu.\n*   -tBu is ortho to -NO2.\n*   -OEt is meta to -NO2.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, frequently involving blocking groups to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common final step for synthesizing an ether is the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This means the immediate precursor would be the corresponding phenol.\n*   **Final Step:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This matches step (ix) in option A: `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing the precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   The phenol group (-OH) is typically introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This is done with `H2O/Heat`. This matches step (vii) in option A.\n*   The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) using `NaNO2/HCl`. This matches step (v) in option A.\n\nThis suggests a strategy where we construct a complex aniline derivative, convert it to a phenol, and then to an ether. The sulfonic acid group (`SO3H`) is a common tool in such multi-step syntheses, acting as a blocking group and a directing group, which can be removed later by **desulfonation** (using `dilute H2SO4/Heat`). This matches step (viii) in option A.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed sequences based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and causing meta-alkylation. This is not a clean or efficient method. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Both start with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` to make tert-butylbenzene, followed by `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration).\n    Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. The para-isomer is major (~70-80%), but the ortho-isomer is also formed. A synthesis that starts with a mixture is generally not considered \"high-yield\". Furthermore, Option C has an impossible step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` on a molecule without an amino group. Option B proceeds to nitrate an aniline derivative directly (`iv) HNO3/H2SO4`), which is a very messy reaction prone to oxidation and poor control. Thus, B and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail, as it seems the most promising.\n\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n       *   Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    ii) **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible para position. This is a high-yield, regioselective step. This is a classic use of a blocking group.\n\n    iii) **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (position 2, which is ortho to -tBu and meta to -SO3H). This is another high-yield, regioselective step.\n\n    iv) **... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    v) **... + NaNO2/HCl → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium chloride.**\n       *   Diazotization of the amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    At this point, we have a diazonium salt with the substituents correctly positioned for further manipulation. The subsequent steps are confusingly written but represent the necessary transformations to reach the final product.\n\n    vi) **... + HNO3/H2SO4**\n       *   This step is the most confusing. It is likely a typo or represents a more complex transformation. A plausible interpretation in the context of a complex synthesis puzzle is a second nitration. The existing groups (-N2+, -tBu, -SO3H) would all direct an incoming electrophile to position 6. Let's assume this happens.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n    vii) **... + H3O+, H2O/Heat**\n       *   This step converts the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfophenol**.\n\n    viii) **... + dilute H2SO4**\n       *   This step is desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group.\n       *   Product: **3-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrophenol**. This is not the correct precursor.\n\n    **Revisiting the Logic:**\n    Despite the confusing final steps, the initial sequence of Option A (i, ii, iii) is the most logical and efficient way to create a specific trisubstituted intermediate from benzene in high yield. The other options have clear flaws in their early steps (creating mixtures or using problematic reactions). It is common in such problems for the correct option to represent the best overall strategy, even if it contains typos or obscure steps. The strategy in A is to use a para-blocking group (-SO3H) to force subsequent substitutions into specific positions, which is the correct approach for this type of target. The subsequent steps involve the correct types of reagents (for reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, and etherification) to convert the intermediate into the final product, even if their exact sequence or purpose as written is ambiguous. Given the clear flaws in B, C, and D, A remains the most plausible choice.\n\n    Let's assume a different, more logical sequence of the later steps that leads to the correct product, which the question author might have intended.\n    Starting from **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid** (product of step iv):\n    1.  Nitrate (this would be step vi). This requires protection of the amine, then nitration (which goes to position 3 or 5), then deprotection. Let's assume it goes to position 3. Product: **2-amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    2.  Diazotize the amino group (step v).\n    3.  Replace the diazonium group with -H (deamination, e.g., with H3PO2, a common reaction not explicitly listed but could be implied by the overall transformation). Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Replace the -SO3H group with -OH (e.g., by alkali fusion, another step not listed but necessary). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is the correct precursor.\n    5.  Etherify with NaOH/EtBr (step ix).\n\n    While this requires steps not listed, it shows that the intermediate from A(iv) can be converted to the target. The key is that the initial steps of A are the only ones that set up the regiochemistry correctly in a high-yield manner.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides the most chemically sound strategy for a high-yield synthesis, especially in the crucial initial steps that establish the substitution pattern. The other options involve steps that would lead to mixtures or are chemically infeasible. Therefore, despite the confusing nature of the later steps, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the proposed options is necessary, considering the directing effects of the substituents and the compatibility of the reactions.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. This 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded, and its synthesis requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts with the tert-butylation of benzene, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group is ortho, para-directing, but due to its large size, it primarily directs incoming groups to the para position. This would lead to 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene, making it difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Analysis of Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) would react with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this pathway is not viable.\n*   **Analysis of Option C:** This route involves using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group. After tert-butylation, sulfonation occurs at the para position. Subsequent nitration would be directed to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group. This leads to a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate, which is not the correct isomer for the final product.\n*   **Analysis of Option D:** This sequence presents the most chemically sound, albeit complex, route to the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, the ortho isomer is required, which would need to be separated.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a critical step. In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. This is a known strategy for synthesizing such substitution patterns. The desired 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is formed, along with the 5-nitro isomer.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D appear to be extraneous, but the core sequence from (i) to (vii) correctly and logically produces the desired compound. This makes Option D the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine a logical synthetic strategy.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   They are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   -OEt is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards):**\n\n1.  **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is typically added last via a Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr) on the corresponding phenol. The immediate precursor is therefore **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Phenol Formation:** A common way to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (e.g., adding H₃O⁺/H₂O and heat). The precursor for this step would be the diazonium salt derived from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Diazonium Salt Formation:** This is achieved by treating an aniline with nitrous acid (NaNO₂/HCl). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the most challenging step, as it requires establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Let's analyze the options to see how this might be achieved. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex; the powerful amino group directs ortho and para (to positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. A more controlled method is needed.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options based on fundamental principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii) on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring would fail or give a very low yield. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically illogical. Step (iv) is the diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires an amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (Fe/HCl reduction). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also illogical. An amine is formed in step (iv) and converted to a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt, which is not a standard or viable reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we must follow the major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This converts p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation, a step often implied in such problems). The directing effect of the resulting acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is still strongly ortho-directing. Nitration will occur at the position ortho to the amine/acetamido group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after deprotection).\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline to form a **diazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, resulting in **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and appear to be extraneous.\n\nWhile steps (i) through (vii) of option B outline a coherent synthesis, they produce an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the desired product. The other options (A, C, D) contain fundamental flaws in their reaction order. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that contains a plausible (though flawed) multi-step synthetic sequence. It is highly likely that there is an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the listed steps. However, among the given choices, B represents the most chemically reasonable sequence, despite its inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a thorough analysis of each proposed route is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the viability of each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options:\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, while the desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is the minor product. This step already compromises the \"high-yield\" objective.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene gives 2-(tert-butyl)aniline.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Crucially, both the -NH3+ group (at C1) and the -tBu group (at C2) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. This reaction can produce the required 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline, although likely as a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline forms a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, forming the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4:** These final two steps, sulfonation and desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.\n\nDespite the low-yield steps and the extraneous final steps, this sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct product structure.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence introduces a blocking group (-SO3H) but contains a chemically incorrect step: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt is not a standard transformation. The overall order of reactions is also illogical for producing the target molecule.\n\n**Option C:** This option is flawed at step `iv) NaNO2/HCl`, which attempts to form a diazonium salt from a substrate that does not contain an amino group.\n\n**Option D:** This sequence fails at step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A is the only sequence that presents a chemically viable, albeit not high-yielding, pathway to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Therefore, despite its imperfections, Option A is the best choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a vicinal (1,2,3) trisubstituted benzene. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nSynthesizing such a sterically crowded molecule with this specific electronic arrangement requires a carefully planned multi-step synthesis, often involving blocking groups or building the molecule from a precursor where the directing effects align favorably.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's think backward from the product (retrosynthesis).\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (from a phenol) with an alkyl halide.\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   Reaction: Deprotonation with a base (like NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   This corresponds to the reagent `NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** Our main challenge is to synthesize the precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Key Intermediate:** How can we make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol? Let's consider adding the substituents to a simpler ring.\n    *   **Path A: Start with m-nitrophenol and add a tert-butyl group.**\n        *   In m-nitrophenol (OH at C1, NO2 at C3), we need to add a t-Bu group at C2.\n        *   Let's check the directing effects for Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\n            *   The -OH group is a strong activator and directs *ortho* (to C2, C6) and *para* (to C4).\n            *   The -NO2 group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n            *   The powerful -OH group controls the reaction. It directs the incoming electrophile (the t-butyl cation) to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   Alkylation at position 2 gives the desired product: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. While a mixture with 4- and 6-alkylated products is expected, this is a plausible way to form the required C-C bond at the correct position.\n\n    *   **Path B: Start with 2-tert-butylphenol and add a nitro group.**\n        *   In 2-tert-butylphenol (OH at C1, tBu at C2), we need to nitrate at C3.\n        *   Directing effects for nitration:\n            *   -OH directs *ortho* (C6) and *para* (C4).\n            *   -tBu directs *ortho* (C3) and *para* (C5).\n            *   The -OH group is a much stronger activator than -tBu and will dominate, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. This path will not yield the desired 3-nitro product.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Path A is the more plausible route. The synthesis should proceed through m-nitrophenol.\n\n**3. Construct the Full Synthesis from Benzene**\n\nNow, let's build the full sequence, starting from benzene, to get to the final product via Path A.\n\n*   **Step 1: Synthesis of m-Nitrophenol from Benzene.**\n    This is a standard textbook synthesis:\n    a.  **Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    b.  **Second Nitration:** Nitrobenzene is nitrated again under harsher conditions. The -NO2 group is a meta-director, so this forms m-dinitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    c.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups in m-dinitrobenzene is selectively reduced to an amino group using a reagent like Na2S or (NH4)2S. The options provide `Fe/HCl`, which typically reduces all nitro groups, but for the sake of a multiple-choice question, we may have to assume it can be controlled or it's the intended reagent for reduction. This step yields m-nitroaniline. (Reagent: `Fe/HCl`)\n    d.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of m-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. (Reagent: `NaNO2/HCl`)\n    e.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in an aqueous acidic solution to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming m-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation of m-Nitrophenol.**\n    f.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** m-Nitrophenol is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst to introduce the tert-butyl group. As determined earlier, this can yield the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n\n*   **Step 3: Etherification.**\n    g.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base with NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `NaOH/EtBr`)\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis with the Given Options**\n\nLet's see which option provides the necessary reagents for this 7-step synthesis. The required reagents are:\n`HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n*   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n*   D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed synthesis:\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (listed twice, as ii and ix)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (listed as viii)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (listed as iv)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (listed as vi)\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (listed as i)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (listed as vii)\n\nThe other options are missing key reagents or include steps that lead to the wrong isomer. For example, Option C involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii), which is not a feasible reaction. Options B and D, through logical application of their steps, would lead to 1,2,4- or 1,3,4-substituted isomers, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAlthough the sequence of reactions in Option A is written in a scrambled and incorrect order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required for a plausible (though complex) synthesis of the target molecule. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and identify the substituents and their relative positions.\n\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is sterically crowded.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents direct incoming groups:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which influences regioselectivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Could the last step be nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The powerful activating -OEt group would direct nitration to its para position (C4) and ortho position (C6). The desired C3 position is meta to the -OEt group, so this would be a very minor product. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, the bulky tert-butyl group would preferentially add to the least sterically hindered position (likely C4 or C6), not the highly hindered C2 position between two existing groups. Also, Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be ether formation?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. The conversion of a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt) using Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH to form the phenoxide, followed by EtBr) is a standard, high-yield reaction. This is a very plausible final step.\n    *   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr** is consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize the precursor, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**?\nA common way to make phenols is via the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is made from an aniline.\n*   Phenol Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   Reaction Sequence: ...-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H3O+/Heat)--> ...-OH.\n    *   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl** and **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat** are consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**?\nLet's renumber this molecule for easier synthetic planning: 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. This has the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. It is very difficult to create this pattern by direct substitution onto a simple benzene derivative.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options, as they must contain the correct (or most plausible) path. The options seem to have typos and extra steps, so we must focus on the core chemical transformations.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Option A & B:** Contain chemically illogical steps, such as attempting diazotization on a molecule without an amine group (A) or nitrating a diazonium salt (B). These are incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic; it typically requires protection of the amine or occurs on the anilinium ion (meta-directing). Neither route easily leads to the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern after subsequent nitration.\n*   **Option D:** This option seems the most promising, despite its confusing structure. Let's analyze the sequence of transformations it suggests, even if the order or completeness is flawed.\n\n**5. Detailed Analysis of the most plausible pathway (based on reagents in Option D)**\n\nA viable, albeit complex, route to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this pattern involves dinitration followed by selective reduction. Let's see if the reagents in Option D fit this path.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n3.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. Nitrating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (C1-tBu, C2-NO2). Both the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -NO2 group (m-directing) direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6. This gives a mixture of 2,4-dinitro- and **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's assume we can isolate the desired **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n4.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of a nitro group. In 2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene, the two nitro groups are equivalent. A controlled reduction (e.g., using (NH4)2S, but Fe/HCl can also be used) can reduce one of them to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. The amino group of 2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis. The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming **2-hydroxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH and then treated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ether, yielding **2-ethoxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nLet's check the name of this final product according to IUPAC rules. The priority for numbering is -OEt > -tBu > -NO2.\n*   The carbon with the -OEt group is C1.\n*   The adjacent carbon with the -tBu group is C2.\n*   The next carbon with the -NO2 group is C3.\nThe name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions described above successfully produces the target molecule. This sequence uses the reagents listed in Option D. Although the order of steps (iii) and (iv) is swapped in the option text and there are superfluous steps (viii, ix) listed at the end, Option D is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for a chemically plausible synthesis. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, despite its flaws, Option D represents the correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. A successful synthesis depends on introducing the substituents in the correct order, taking into account their directing effects and the chemical compatibility of the reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituents**\n\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the ortho position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Intermediates:** To introduce the -OEt group, a common strategy is to first create a phenol (-OH) and then perform a Williamson ether synthesis. A phenol can be made from an amino group (-NH₂) via a diazonium salt. An amino group is typically made by reducing a nitro group.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical validity:\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Valid)\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Valid)\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction **fails** when attempted on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents the alkylation reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because step (iii) is not a viable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: This reagent combination is used for diazotization, a reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt. The substrate from step (iii) is not an amine.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect because step (iv) is performed on an inappropriate substrate.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. (Valid)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This step proposes reacting the diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture. This is **not a standard or logical synthetic transformation**. The goal is to create a phenol to later form the ether, which is typically achieved by heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because step (vi) is chemically nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is a minor product, but it is formed. (Valid step)\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene to yield 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\niv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, yielding 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. (Valid step)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the corresponding phenol, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Valid)\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to a phenoxide by NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product. (Valid)\nviii) & ix): The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and would not be part of an efficient synthesis, but the core pathway from (i) to (vii) is chemically sound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A, while not ideal in terms of yield due to poor regioselectivity in some steps, represents the only chemically plausible pathway from start to finish among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nOf course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the desired product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n    *   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** Understanding how these groups influence further substitutions is crucial.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. However, it is very large (sterically bulky), which strongly hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **The Core Synthetic Challenge:** The main difficulty in this synthesis is placing a substituent *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will almost exclusively yield the *para* product due to steric hindrance. A successful synthesis must therefore use a specific strategy to overcome this.\n\n### **2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n#### **Option D: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) is an acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\n\n#### **Option B: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (the para product is major).\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction. **This reaction fails.** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n#### **Option C: Incorrect (Leads to the Wrong Isomer)**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As established, due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n3.  The rest of the synthesis would proceed from this 1,4-disubstituted (para) intermediate. It is impossible to rearrange this structure to the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This sequence would produce an isomer of the target molecule, but not the target molecule itself.\n\n#### **Option A: Correct Strategy**\nThis sequence employs a clever and necessary strategy using a **blocking group**.\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) adds to the sterically most accessible position, which is *para* to the tert-butyl group. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The purpose of this step is to **block** the para position.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now that the *para* position is blocked, the incoming nitro group is forced to go to a position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both existing groups direct the new substituent to this same position:\n    *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and since *para* is blocked, it directs *ortho*.\n    *   The -SO₃H group is a *m*-director, and it also directs to the position *ortho* to the -tBu group.\n    This step successfully creates an intermediate with the crucial *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the later steps (iv-ix) in option A appear jumbled and may contain typos, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the **only one** presented that correctly solves the main chemical problem of forcing substitution ortho to a bulky tert-butyl group. In multiple-choice chemistry questions, you must identify the sequence that contains the correct core strategy, even if the full sequence is imperfectly written.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
