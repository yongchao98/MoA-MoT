Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    From these, we can see that $x^2 = (r \\cos(\\theta))^2 = r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$.\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (x^2)$\n\n2.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n    Combine the terms:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the System**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (4k) x^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.

The relationships between these coordinate systems are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ k(x²)\nV(x, y) = ½ kx² + ½ ky² + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = (½ + ³⁄₂)kx² + ½ ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + ½ ky²\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.

The angular frequency ωₓ is then:\nmωₓ² = 4k  => ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħωₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nVᵧ(y) = ½ ky²\nThe spring constant is kᵧ = k.

Start with the given potential in polar coordinates, V(r, θ).\n2.  Convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformation equations: `x = r * cos(θ)` and `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`.\n3.  Simplify the potential in Cartesian coordinates. You will find that it separates into two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y: `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`.\n4.  Recognize that this is the potential for a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The total energy `E` will be the sum of the energies of two independent 1D quantum harmonic oscillators, `E = E_x + E_y`.\n5.  For each direction (x and y), identify the effective spring constant (`k_x` and `k_y`) from the potential terms `V_x(x) = 1/2 * k_x * x^2` and `V_y(y) = 1/2 * k_y * y^2`.\n6.  Recall the energy spectrum for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator: `E_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω`, where `ω = sqrt(k_effective / m)`.\n7.  Calculate the energies `E_x` and `E_y` using their respective quantum numbers (`n_x`, `n_y`) and angular frequencies (`ω_x`, `ω_y`).\n8.  Sum the energies `E_x` and `E_y` to find the total energy spectrum `E`.\n9.

This suggests that solving the Schrödinger equation directly in polar coordinates might be complicated. A good strategy is to see if the potential simplifies in another coordinate system.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nLet's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n*   x = r * cos(θ)\n*   y = r * sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r * cos(θ))^2\n\nSince x = r * cos(θ), we can replace the second term:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\nNow, group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Physical System**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction. This means we can solve the Schrödinger equation by separating the variables x and y.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Separated Schrödinger Equations**\n\nThe total energy E of the system will be the sum of the energies from the independent x and y motions:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\nWe need to find the energy spectrum for each one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
