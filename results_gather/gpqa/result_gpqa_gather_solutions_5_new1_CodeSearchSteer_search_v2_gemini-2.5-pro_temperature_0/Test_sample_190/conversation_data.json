It's a cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at C1. At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /  \\\nC6  C3--CH2OH\n|   |\nC5--C4\n|\nC(CH3)=CH2\n```\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr)** is an electrophile. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a good nucleophile and will attack the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n3.  The -CH2OH group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group, -CH2-O-CH2Ph (-CH2OBn). This protects the alcohol group from the reagents in the subsequent steps.\n\n**Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /  \\\nC6  C3--CH2-O-Bn\n|   |\nC5--C4\n|\nC(CH3)=CH2\n```\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n1.  This reaction involves the condensation of a ketone with a hydrazine derivative.\n2.  The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a **tosylhydrazone**. Water is eliminated in the process.\n\n**Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n```\n      N-NH-Ts\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /  \\\nC6  C3--CH2-O-Bn\n|   |\nC5--C4\n|\nC(CH3)=CH2\n```\n(where Ts = p-toluenesulfonyl group)\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n\n1.  This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**. A tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong, non-hindered base like n-BuLi.\n2.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon with the least steric hindrance. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less substituted than C2 (which is adjacent to the C3 substituent). Therefore, C6 is deprotonated.\n3.  The resulting dianion eliminates p-toluenesulfinate (Ts-) and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) workup protonates the vinyllithium species.\n5.  The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of the ketone into an alkene, with the double bond formed at the less substituted side.\n\n**Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (The numbering of the ring changes based on IUPAC rules for alkenes, but the connectivity relative to the original skeleton is a double bond between C1 and C6).\n\n```\n     C6=C1--C2\n    /       |\n  C5--------C3--CH2-O-Bn\n  |         |\n  C(CH3)=CH2 C4\n```\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Pd/C is a heterogeneous catalyst that is very effective for several types of reductions.\n2.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C1=C6) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (hydrogenated) to single bonds.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group (-OBn) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis under these conditions. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon breaks, and the resulting fragments are capped with hydrogen.\n    *   The -CH2-O-Bn group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2-OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH3).\n\n**Product 4:**\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product has:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   An isopropyl group at the position corresponding to the original C5.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group at the position corresponding to the original C3.\n\nThe resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol function takes priority. The molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The substituent attached to the methanol carbon is a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group.\n\n**Final Product Name:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone has reacted in step 3.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches our derived structure.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is unlikely with H2/Pd-C.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol (the most acidic proton) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazine) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). This reaction converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone through a condensation reaction, where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonate the hydrazone and then the less-substituted α-carbon. The intermediate then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by the aqueous ammonium chloride to yield an alkene. The ketone at position 1 is thus removed and replaced by a double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The major product will have the double bond formed between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted adjacent carbon (C6). The isopropenyl and benzyloxymethyl groups remain.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. These conditions are standard for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be reduced. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a very common and effective method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, converting them back to alcohols.\n*   **Final Transformation:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, the cyclohexene is reduced to a cyclohexane, and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to the primary alcohol.\n\nThe final structure, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Based on the numbering of the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The butyl group from n-BuLi does not add to the molecule in a Shapiro reaction, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches the expected outcome of the full reaction sequence.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This represents an unreacted or partially reacted intermediate.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is unlikely under these standard hydrogenation conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the structure of product 4:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic functional group, which is the alcohol (-OH). The resulting alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. This reaction protects the alcohol group. The ketone and alkene remain unchanged. Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of acid. This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone functional group is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and alkene) are not affected. Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This is a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group, and the formation of an alkene where the ketone used to be. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon and the less-substituted adjacent carbon. The subsequent quench with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the intermediate to yield the final alkene. Product 3 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** Product 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This powerful reducing condition has two effects here:\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds. The alkene in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain are both reduced to alkanes (a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively).\n    *   It causes hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether, cleaving the C-O bond and converting the protected alcohol back into a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n\n5.  **Determine Final Structure:** Combining these transformations, the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** Comparing this structure to the given choices, it matches option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the multi-step synthesis problem and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options provided in the problem\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\",\n        \"B\": \"(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\",\n        \"C\": \"3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol\",\n        \"D\": \"(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene\"\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence\n    # Step 1: Williamson ether synthesis protects the alcohol.\n    # Starting material: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n    # Product 1: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n    # Step 2: Tosylhydrazone formation from the ketone.\n    # Product 2: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n    # Step 3: Shapiro reaction converts the tosylhydrazone to an alkene.\n    # Product 3: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n    # Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) reduces both alkenes and cleaves the benzyl ether (hydrogenolysis).\n    # - The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n    # - The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    # - The benzyl ether is cleaved back to a primary alcohol.\n    # Final Product (Product 4): (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\n    # The derived final product matches option B.\n    final_answer_choice = \"B\"\n    final_answer_structure = options[final_answer_choice]\n\n    print(f\"The final product of the reaction sequence is {final_answer_structure}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is {final_answer_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\nThe correct option is B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Key functional groups:** Ketone, primary alcohol, alkene.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** This is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reaction:** The alcohol group is protected as a benzyl ether.\n    -CH2OH → -CH2O⁻ → -CH2-O-CH2-Ph (or -CH2OBn)\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide:** This reagent reacts with aldehydes and ketones.\n    2.  **HCl (catalyst):** The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and accelerating the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule).\n    C=O → C=N-NHTs\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. Its systematic name is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** This is a very strong base. The reaction of a tosylhydrazone with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi is known as the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** n-BuLi first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, then a second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond. The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl):** This is a mild proton source used in the workup to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction is a method for converting a ketone into an alkene. The original C=O group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon and one of its adjacent α-carbons.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The structure is a substituted cyclohexene, for example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The exact position of the newly formed double bond is not critical for determining the final product.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) will be reduced to single bonds (C-C). This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be hydrogenated.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** A key reaction catalyzed by Pd/C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers (and benzyl esters, benzylamines, etc.). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken, and hydrogen atoms are added.\n        *   Benzyl ether [-CH2-O-Bn] → Alcohol [-CH2-OH] + Toluene [Ph-CH3]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product will have a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the original hydroxymethyl group. The substituents on the ring are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship from the starting material.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Evaluation:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is a benzyl ether. The benzyl ether is cleaved in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not its role in the Shapiro reaction. It also incorrectly retains the benzyl ether.\n\nThe final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **NaH (Sodium Hydride):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **BnBr (Benzyl Bromide):** An electrophilic alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The sodium alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The alcohol group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The benzyl group (Bn) acts as a protecting group for the alcohol.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide in a condensation reaction (similar to imine formation) to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-BuLi (n-butyllithium):** A very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used.\n    2.  **Aqueous NH₄Cl:** Used for workup to protonate the intermediate.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene.\n    *   The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    *   The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    *   The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate anion), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous NH₄Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone group is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C double bond in the ring. The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes part of this new double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (the exact position of the double bond could be C1-C2 or C1-C6, but this does not affect the final product's constitution).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which has two effects here:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group is broken, and the oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        *   -CH₂OBn → -CH₂OH\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The relative 1,3-positioning of these substituents on the ring is maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this compound is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate (related to Product 2), not the final product.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product. It has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect. It contains a butyl group (from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile, which doesn't happen in a Shapiro reaction) and retains the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by hydrogenation.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the benzyl ether of the final product. It would be the result if the hydrogenation did not cleave the protecting group, which is incorrect for Pd/C catalysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol (-OH) group to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl (prop-1-en-2-yl) groups remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal amine of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench. This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, a tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong organolithium base. This process converts the ketone into an alkene by forming a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. The overall result is the replacement of the C=O group with a C=C double bond. The double bond forms at the position of the original ketone, resulting in a cyclohexene ring.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard and effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers to regenerate the corresponding alcohol. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is reduced back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this structure to the given options:\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. A butyl group is added, and the benzyl ether is intact.\nB) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone, not the final product after the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation.\nC) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the predicted product from the full reaction sequence.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis is a very common outcome under these conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide.\n*   **Function of reagents**: Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which in this case is the hydroxyl (-OH) group of the alcohol. This forms a sodium alkoxide. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction**: The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the primary alcohol into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the alkene (isopropenyl group) remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1**: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosyl hydrazide) in the presence of catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   **Function of reagents**: p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form tosylhydrazones. The acid catalyzes the condensation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at the C1 position of the cyclohexanone ring condenses with the tosyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2**: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride workup.\n*   **Function of reagents**: This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi are used to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the formation of a vinyllithium intermediate with the elimination of nitrogen gas and the tosyl group. The aqueous ammonium chloride then quenches the vinyllithium species by protonating it.\n*   **Reaction**: The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted adjacent carbon. In this case, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3**: (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Function of reagents**: Pd/C with H₂ is a powerful system for catalytic hydrogenation. It is commonly used to reduce carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds. It is also very effective for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers to form an alcohol and toluene.\n*   **Reaction**: Both alkene groups in Product 3 (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group) will be reduced to alkanes. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. Simultaneously, the benzyl ether will be cleaved back to the primary alcohol. While conditions can sometimes be tuned to prevent debenzylation, standard hydrogenation with Pd/C typically cleaves benzyl ethers, especially in the presence of other reducible groups like alkenes.\n*   **Product 4**: The complete reduction and hydrogenolysis result in (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies a different reaction pathway.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This implies the Shapiro reaction did not proceed to completion.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the predicted product after all four reaction steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe search results confirm the predicted reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The reaction of an alcohol with sodium hydride (NaH) to form an alkoxide, followed by reaction with benzyl bromide, is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Ketones react with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form p-toluenesulfonylhydrazones (tosylhydrazones).\n*   **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** The treatment of a tosylhydrazone with two equivalents of a strong base like n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) converts the ketone into an alkene. The reaction proceeds by deprotonation of the hydrazone, followed by deprotonation of the less substituted alpha-carbon, elimination of the tosyl group, loss of nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. This effectively removes the carbonyl group and creates a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) is a common and effective catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes. This same catalytic system is also standard for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers to yield an alcohol and toluene. Therefore, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced, and the benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved.\n\nBased on this confirmed reaction sequence:\n1.  The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is converted to **Product 1**, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n2.  Product 1 is converted to **Product 2**, the corresponding tosylhydrazone at the C1 position.\n3.  Product 2 undergoes a Shapiro reaction to form **Product 3**, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n4.  Product 3 is treated with H2 and Pd/C. The two alkene groups are hydrogenated (prop-1-en-2-yl becomes isopropyl, and cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane), and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to an alcohol. This yields **Product 4**, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of several steps.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the predicted product after the full reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) and Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains two acidic functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and a ketone. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   **Reagent 1: NaH.** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will selectively deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl Bromide (BnBr).** The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines (like tosylhydrazide) in a condensation reaction to form hydrazones. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the nitrogen atom of the hydrazone (-NH-Ts).\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon atom α to the C=N bond that is less sterically hindered. In this case, both α-carbons (C2 and C6) are CH₂ groups, but the reaction typically proceeds via deprotonation at the less hindered site to form a dianion.\n    3.  This dianion is unstable and collapses. It eliminates the tosylsulfinate anion (-Ts) and a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂), which is an excellent leaving group.\n    4.  This process generates a vinyllithium intermediate, where the lithium atom is attached to the carbon that was originally the carbonyl carbon.\n    5.  The final step is quenching the reaction with a proton source, such as aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n*   **Outcome:** The Shapiro reaction effectively replaces the original ketone group with a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the adjacent α-carbon (C6 or C2).\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring is converted to a cyclohexene ring. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are retained.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or a regioisomer, but the final product's constitution will be the same).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Under these standard conditions, several transformations occur:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group are reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken by hydrogen, a process called hydrogenolysis. This regenerates the original alcohol and produces toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl ether would be cleaved, and the butyl group from n-BuLi is not incorporated into the product in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final structure: a cyclohexane ring with a 1,3-substitution pattern of an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether were not cleaved. Standard hydrogenation with Pd/C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This implies the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) did not occur.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule has a cyclohexanone core.\n*   At C1: a ketone group (C=O).\n*   At C3: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5: an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\nThe substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.**\n*   This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone at C1 condenses with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The acid (HCl) catalyzes the reaction.\n    R₂C=O + H₂NNHTs → R₂C=NNHTs + H₂O\n\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n*   This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**. The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is adjacent to the substituent at C3, making it more sterically hindered than C6. Therefore, deprotonation occurs at C6.\n2.  The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate), to form a vinyllithium intermediate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n3.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** is a mild proton source that quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium to form the final alkene.\n\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is effectively removed and replaced by a double bond. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. (The double bond is between C1 and C6).\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for this process.\n*   This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be saturated.\n        *   cyclohexene → cyclohexane\n        *   isopropenyl group → isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen, regenerating the alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   R-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → R-OH + PhCH₃ (Toluene)\n\n*   **Applying these transformations to Product 3:**\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The 3-((benzyloxy)methyl) group becomes a 3-(hydroxymethyl) group.\n    *   The 5-(prop-1-en-2-yl) group becomes a 5-(isopropyl) group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.

The strong base removes two protons (first from the -NH- group, then from the carbon α to the C=N bond), leading to the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N2), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent quench with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C1 is removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring, originating from C1. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) is a powerful catalyst for **catalytic hydrogenation**.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction will reduce multiple functional groups in the molecule:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (a benzylic position) is cleaved by hydrogen. This process, called hydrogenolysis, removes the benzyl protecting group (C6H5CH2-) and regenerates the original alcohol (-OH). The byproduct is toluene (C6H5CH3).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2) in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on the derived structure of Product 4:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a hydrazide/hydrazone derivative, which is incorrect as the Shapiro reaction removes this functionality.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of acid.

This initiates a Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene by treatment with two equivalents of a strong organolithium base. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated and replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing agent performs two transformations:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the catalyst, regenerating the primary alcohol.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is formed.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nBased on this four-step synthesis, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol functional group. In the presence of sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, the alcohol is deprotonated to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1, which contains a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of an acid catalyst.

The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This process eliminates the tosylhydrazone group and forms a carbon-carbon double bond where the ketone was originally located. The reaction is regioselective, typically forming the less sterically hindered, or kinetic, alkene product. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride serves to quench the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This step results in two transformations:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the Pd/C and H₂ to regenerate the alcohol.\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Based on the positions in the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3- (or meta) relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect.

This represents an intermediate stage or an alternative reaction pathway, not the final product after the Shapiro and hydrogenation steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr). This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol group (-OH) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. The other functional groups (ketone and alkene) are unaffected by these reagents.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This is a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) removes two protons, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>), which forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is regioselective, favoring the formation of the less substituted alkene. In this case, the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted alpha-carbon (C6). The aqueous workup then protonates the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene product.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst that will reduce all the carbon-carbon double bonds present in the molecule. This includes the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group (which becomes an isopropyl group). Furthermore, under these conditions, Pd/C will also cleave the benzyl ether via hydrogenolysis, converting it back to an alcohol.\n\n*   Reduction of alkenes: The cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group are both saturated.\n*   Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether: The benzyloxy-methyl group (-CH<sub>2</sub>OBn) is converted to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH<sub>2</sub>OH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   This is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then Benzyl Bromide**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    1.  The NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide: R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. The hydroxymethyl group becomes a (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH2OBn).\n    The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    The structure of Product 2 is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon atom α to the C=N bond.\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The aqueous NH4Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The ketone is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative. It has a double bond in the ring, the (benzyloxy)methyl group, and the isopropenyl group.\n    The structure of Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (or an isomeric cyclohexene, which leads to the same final product).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C and H₂**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is very effective at reducing multiple types of functional groups.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken.\n        *   R-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → R-OH + Ph-CH₃ (Toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).

Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the alcohol group, forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).

This intermediate then eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The subsequent aqueous workup protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene. The overall effect is the replacement of the original ketone with a double bond, typically formed at the less sterically hindered adjacent position.

The substituents (-CH2OH and the isopropenyl group) are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    *   NaH reacts with the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr, Ph-CH2-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   The alkoxide displaces the bromide ion, forming a benzyl ether (-CH2-O-CH2-Ph, abbreviated as -CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts specifically with aldehydes and ketones under acidic catalysis.\n    *   The nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated to form a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). The other functional groups (benzyl ether and alkene) are unaffected.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction.\n    *   n-Butyllithium is a very strong base. It is used in excess (typically 2 equivalents). The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon α (adjacent) to the original carbonyl carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   This dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyl anion.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride is a mild proton source that quenches the vinyl anion, protonating it.\n    *   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond, located between the original carbonyl carbon and the α-carbon that was deprotonated. The reaction typically forms the less substituted alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** A new double bond is formed in the ring, for example, between C1 and C6. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are still in a 1,3-relationship. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C with H₂ is a powerful reducing system that can reduce several functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced.\n        1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated to a single bond, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n        2.  The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is hydrogenated to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction). The C-O bond between the benzyl group's CH₂ and the oxygen is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol.\n        R-O-CH₂-Ph + H₂ → R-OH + CH₃-Ph (toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their original 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Final Structure Identification:**\nThe final product, Product 4, is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Let's compare this with the given options.\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This perfectly matches our derived structure.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazide group was eliminated in Step 3.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under these conditions.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure would result from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the course of a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   It has a ketone group at position 1 (C1=O).\n    *   It has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 (-CH2OH).\n    *   It has an isopropenyl group at position 5 (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ~16-18) than the alpha-protons to the ketone (pKa ~19-20).\n    *   NaH reacts with the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   The alkoxide is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2Ph, abbreviated as -CH2OBn). The rest of the molecule is unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction (loss of H2O), catalyzed by acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one tosylhydrazone.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   n-BuLi is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon alpha to the original ketone (C2 or C6).\n    *   Deprotonation will occur at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, which is C6 (C2 is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    *   The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between C1 and C6.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride workup protonates the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the replacement of the ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with the double bond between the original C1 and C6 carbons. The ring still carries the benzyloxymethyl group and the isopropenyl group. A possible IUPAC name is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is used to reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and also to cleave benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn) is cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken by hydrogen, regenerating the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and forming toluene (PhCH3) as a byproduct. The use of a benzyl group as a protecting group for an alcohol relies on its easy removal by this method.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative positions of these two substituents are the same as in the starting material (on C3 and C5), which is a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** This molecule is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure for Product 4 with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. While possible under very mild or specific conditions, standard H2/Pd-C hydrogenation typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure results from an incorrect reaction sequence, ignoring the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway, assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on a ketone.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches the expected final product after all four reaction steps, including the reduction of all double bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether protecting group.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe reaction sequence described involves four distinct synthetic steps. A careful analysis of each step leads to the structure of the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the alcohol.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a classic Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming product 1, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of a tosylhydrazone.** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of acid. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, product 2. This is a standard preparatory step for the Shapiro reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction.** The tosylhydrazone (product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This reaction, known as the Shapiro reaction, converts the ketone into an alkene by first forming a dianion, which then eliminates nitrogen gas and the tosyl group to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. This intermediate is then quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride to yield a protonated alkene, product 3. The original ketone at position C1 is thus removed and replaced with a double bond. The resulting product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reduction method affects multiple parts of the molecule:\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, saturating the ring.\n    *   The double bond of the isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is also reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    *   Crucially, the benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved via hydrogenolysis to regenerate the alcohol. This reaction splits the benzyl ether back into a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and toluene. It's a standard method for deprotecting benzyl ethers.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product, product 4, is a cyclohexane ring where the ketone has been removed, the isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyl ether has reverted to a primary alcohol. This results in (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis of the reaction sequence, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe step-by-step chemical transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. The product of this step, Product 1, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Product 1, a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a condensation reaction that converts the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). Product 2 is the corresponding tosylhydrazone.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) undergoes a Shapiro reaction upon treatment with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone group and forms a carbon-carbon double bond where the original carbonyl group was located. A subsequent quench with aqueous ammonium chloride provides a proton to form the final alkene. The product, Product 3, is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.** Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This versatile reagent performs two transformations here:\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** The two carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved. The bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, and the resulting groups are capped with hydrogen. This converts the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). It is a standard method for deprotecting benzyl ethers, although it can sometimes be inhibited by certain additives.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct structure for product 4 is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n\nThis is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol group (-OH) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n\nThe ketone group of Product 1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (often called a tosylhydrazone). The acid catalyst facilitates this condensation reaction.\n\n*   **Product 2:** 4-methyl-N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)benzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n\nThis is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which converts the ketone into an alkene. The base removes two protons, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride then quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene. The result is the removal of the original ketone and formation of a C=C double bond in its place.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n\nThis is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C and H₂ will reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds. Product 3 has two such bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl group. Both will be reduced to single bonds, converting the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which reduces them back to alcohols.\n\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  Reduction of the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  Reduction of the cyclohexene C=C bond to a C-C single bond.\n    3.  Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies a different reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches the product expected from the complete reduction and hydrogenolysis of Product 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This is a cyclohexanone molecule with three key functional groups: a ketone (C=O) at position 1, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5. The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH) is the most acidic site (pKa ~16-18), more so than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). This forms a sodium alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis (an S_N2 reaction). The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   This reaction selectively protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether (-O-CH2-Ph). The ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is the standard procedure for forming a tosylhydrazone from a ketone.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N bond, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the ketone for this condensation reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1. The structure at C1 is now C=N-NHTs.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n    *   This set of reagents and conditions corresponds to the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone back into an alkene, effectively removing the original oxygen atom from the ketone.\n    *   n-Butyllithium, a very strong base, deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice. The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating the stable p-toluenesulfinate anion and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the vinyllithium by protonating it.\n    *   The net result is the transformation of the ketone functional group into a carbon-carbon double bond. The C=O group at C1 is replaced by a C=C bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative. The ring now contains a double bond where the ketone was. The molecule retains the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. An example structure would be 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The crucial point is that the 1,3-relationship of the substituent attachment points on the ring's carbon framework is preserved.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Stirring Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** All C=C double bonds in the molecule will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n        1.  The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, making the ring a saturated **cyclohexane**.\n        2.  The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced, forming an **isopropyl group** (-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved under these conditions. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2-O-CH2-Ph) is converted back into a **hydroxymethyl group** (-CH2OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Since the 1,3-relationship between the substituents was maintained throughout the synthesis, they are in a 1,3-arrangement on the final cyclohexane ring. This structure is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare this derived structure with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone, an intermediate.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies nucleophilic addition of BuLi and retention of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which is cleaved in the final step.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one + NaH, then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (PhCH2Br):** An alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first part is a good nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn or -OCH₂Ph). This is a common method for protecting an alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also called tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction converts a ketone (or aldehyde) into a tosylhydrazone. The lone pair on the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aq. NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl):** A mild acid used for workup to protonate any anionic species.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**. The dianion formed by the action of n-BuLi undergoes spontaneous elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. This vinyllithium is then quenched (protonated) by the aqueous workup.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone functional group is replaced by a C=C double bond, effectively removing the original ketone oxygen and converting the C-N bond to a C-C pi bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position. The overall result is the conversion of a ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain untouched. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H₂**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in the molecule (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is also highly effective at cleaving benzyl ethers (a process called hydrogenolysis). The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) will be cleaved back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), releasing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Renaming this final molecule according to IUPAC rules, it is a substituted methanol. The main chain is methanol, and the substituent is a (3-isopropylcyclohexyl) group.\n*   **Final Structure:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Incorrect.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure still contains the tosylhydrazide group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol** - This structure correctly reflects the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. **This is the correct answer.**\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This suggests a nucleophilic attack of butyllithium on the ketone, which does not happen in a Shapiro reaction. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's analyze each reaction step by step to determine the final structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This process protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1 Structure:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =NNHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The ketone (C=O) is converted to C=NNHTs.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** These are the conditions for a **Shapiro reaction**. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice to form a dianion. This unstable intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a sulfinate salt to generate a vinyllithium species. This reaction effectively replaces the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The quench with aqueous NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium to give the alkene product.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** A cyclohexene ring containing the (benzyloxy)methyl and isopropenyl substituents. For example, **4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated, and the double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C reagent combination is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (deprotection). The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn) is reduced back to the original hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4 Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyl ether has been cleaved to reveal the original hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This structure matches the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This assumes an incorrect reaction pathway for n-BuLi and fails to account for the deprotection in the final step.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the intermediate before the final hydrogenolysis step; the benzyl protecting group is still present.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three main functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group). It also has acidic α-protons adjacent to the ketone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Thus, NaH selectively deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n        R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr, PhCH₂Br):** The sodium alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n        R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph (a benzyl ether) + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged. The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide). This reagent reacts with aldehydes and ketones in a condensation reaction to form a tosylhydrazone. The acid catalyst (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, activating it for nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the hydrazide, followed by dehydration.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The structure of Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. Typically, two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl):** This is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively replaces a carbonyl group (via its tosylhydrazone derivative) with a C-H bond and a C=C double bond. The ketone is deoxygenated to an alkene. The double bond can form between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6. Regardless of the exact position, the result is a cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a double bond originating from C1. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unchanged. The structure of Product 3 is a **cyclohexene derivative with a (benzyloxy)methyl substituent and a (prop-1-en-2-yl) substituent**. For example, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation.\n*   **Reactions:** This reaction will cause three transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkene in the ring:** The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Reduction of Alkene in the side chain:** The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the original alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ --(Pd/C)--> R-CH₂OH + CH₃Ph\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group. Based on the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring (they were at positions 3 and 5 on the original cyclohexanone ring).\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is an alcohol. The parent name is methanol. The substituent is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group. Numbering the ring from the point of attachment to the methanol group (C1), the isopropyl group is at C3. Therefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing this derived structure name with the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved in the final step.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure results from several incorrect reaction pathways.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is not the product of the full reaction sequence.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group do not react under these conditions. Product 1 is therefore 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. Product 2 is the corresponding tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, a tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) are used to deprotonate first the N-H group and then the less-substituted α-carbon. This is followed by the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous ammonium chloride, yielding an alkene. The original ketone at C1 is thus replaced by a double bond, typically positioned at the less substituted side, between C1 and C6. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group are not affected. Product 3 is therefore (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n    Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated (reduced to single bonds), converting the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. Simultaneously, the benzyl ether (O-Bn) is cleaved back to a primary alcohol (-OH). Therefore, the final product, Product 4, is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this four-step synthesis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe analysis of the reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, which is an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, to form a benzyl ether. The product of this step, Product 1, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The resulting Product 2 is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a strong base. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, two equivalents of the strong base deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas, forming an alkene. The reaction typically forms the less substituted (kinetic) alkene. This reaction converts the ketone, via its tosylhydrazone, into a carbon-carbon double bond. The aqueous ammonium chloride is used for workup. Product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This process will reduce the two alkene double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) to single bonds. Simultaneously, Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols. Therefore, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the benzyl ether is cleaved to regenerate the primary alcohol.\n\nThe final structure, Product 4, is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which in this case is the hydroxyl proton of the alcohol, forming a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming Product 1: **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a condensation reaction where the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.\n    *   This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which converts the ketone into an alkene. The first equivalent of base deprotonates the hydrazone nitrogen, and the second deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon. This intermediate then eliminates nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium species.\n    *   The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n    *   Product 3 is **(((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   The isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, resulting in a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Crucially, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard and efficient method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a reaction called hydrogenolysis), regenerating the alcohol. This deprotection often occurs under the same mild conditions used for alkene hydrogenation.\n    *   Therefore, both C=C double bonds are reduced, and the benzyl ether is cleaved to yield an alcohol.\n    *   The final structure, Product 4, is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches the derived structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction does not add the butyl group to the ring.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This fails to account for the Shapiro reaction and subsequent hydrogenation of the tosylhydrazone.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if only the alkenes were reduced, but not the benzyl ether. Standard hydrogenation conditions typically cleave benzyl ethers.\n\nThus, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nLet's first draw the structure. It's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 1 is the ketone (=O). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is more commonly known as an isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2].\n\n```\n      O\n      //\n     C\n   /   \\\nH2C     CH -- CH2OH\n |       |\nHC -- CH2\n |\nC(=CH2)CH3\n```\nThe molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Reagent 1: Sodium hydride (NaH)**. NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is much more acidic than the alpha-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Thus, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl bromide (BnBr)**. This is an electrophile. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first step attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis).\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\nThis reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn), effectively protecting the alcohol. The ketone and alkene do not react under these conditions.\n**Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 is a ketone, and it is treated with a hydrazine derivative (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide) under acidic conditions.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic condensation reaction to form a hydrazone. The ketone reacts with the hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (or tosylhydrazone for short), with the elimination of a water molecule.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\n**Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of product 1. The C=O group at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents acting on a tosylhydrazone signifies a Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. It's a deoxygenation reaction. Two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- group. The second deprotonates the carbon alpha to the C=N bond. This intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium species.\n*   **Workup:** The aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild acid) quenches the vinyllithium intermediate by protonating it.\nThe overall transformation is the replacement of the original C=O group with a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered alpha position (kinetic control). In this case, it will form between the original C1 and C2, or C1 and C6. Regardless of the exact position, the product is a cyclohexene derivative.\n**Product 3** is a cyclohexene substituted with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship on the ring framework. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C and H₂ are the standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This powerful reducing system will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene reduction:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon breaks.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂OBn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH] (plus toluene as a byproduct).\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached. These two substituents retain the 1,3-relationship they had in the starting material.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is 1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane. This can also be named as **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: This name describes our final product perfectly.\nB) **(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H₂ readily cleaves benzyl ethers.\nC) **N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**: This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction in step 3, which eliminates the tosylhydrazone group.\nD) **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction. It suggests n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the main pathway for tosylhydrazones.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reaction sequence, Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, then benzyl bromide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material has a ketone, an alcohol (hydroxymethyl), and an alkene (isopropenyl) functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, forming a benzyl ether. The ketone and the alkene groups remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** The product of this step is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 is a ketone. It reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. Water is eliminated in the process.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous NH₄Cl**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 is a tosylhydrazone. It is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone of a ketone is converted to an alkene. Treatment with two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi deprotonates the hydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas and the formation of a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate, protonating it to form the final alkene product. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is the kinetic product.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is effectively replaced by a double bond. The double bond forms between C1 and C6 of the cyclohexene ring. The other groups are unaffected. The resulting structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 contains two carbon-carbon double bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether. It is treated with hydrogen gas over a palladium-on-carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Additionally, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    2.  The isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    3.  The benzyl ether is cleaved, removing the benzyl group and regenerating the hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a hydrazide, not the final hydrocarbon/alcohol product.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches the result of the complete reaction sequence.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether were not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers with H₂/Pd-C is a common reaction.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies the n-butyllithium acted as a nucleophile, which is not its primary role in the Shapiro reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy plan is to trace the transformations of the starting material through the four-step reaction sequence to determine the final structure of product 4.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting material + NaH, then Benzyl Bromide -> Product 1**\n    *   The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. It has three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic than any C-H proton, including those alpha to the ketone.\n    *   NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) to form an alkoxide (-CH2O-).\n    *   This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis). The alcohol is converted into a benzyl ether.\n    *   Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol is protected, while the ketone and alkene remain.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), cat. HCl -> Product 2**\n    *   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N-NHTs group.\n    *   Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aq. NH4Cl -> Product 3**\n    *   This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base (n-BuLi).\n    *   n-BuLi deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to a dianion. This dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N2) and a tosyl anion to form a vinyllithium intermediate where the ketone used to be.\n    *   The vinyllithium is quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH4Cl) to form an alkene. The net result is the replacement of the original C=O group with a C=C double bond within the ring.\n    *   Product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or another isomer depending on which alpha-proton is removed, but the exact position is not critical for the final step).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H2 -> Product 4**\n    *   This is catalytic hydrogenation. Pd/C with H2 is a powerful reducing agent for several functional groups.\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds:\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n        *   The cyclohexene double bond is reduced, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n    *   It also performs hydrogenolysis on benzyl ethers:\n        *   The benzyloxy group (-O-CH2-Ph) is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol (-OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n    *   Putting it all together: The final molecule, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group. The relative 1,3-substitution pattern from the start is maintained. The chemical name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n5.  **Matching with options:**\n    *   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile, in the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n    *   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether would be cleaved by hydrogenolysis under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n```python\n# The four-step reaction sequence leads to the following transformations:\n# 1.

It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material. The alcohol's proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ~ 16-18) than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ~ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br):** The alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reaction:** R-OH + NaH → R-O⁻Na⁺ + H₂; then R-O⁻Na⁺ + BnBr → R-O-Bn + NaBr.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The nucleophilic nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This is an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Reaction:** R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at position 1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NH-Ts). The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence of reagents applied to a tosylhydrazone is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **n-BuLi:** Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). Deprotonation occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the C6 position is less hindered than the C2 position (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    2.  **Collapse:** The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the stable p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), forming a vinyl lithium species. The new C=C double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n    3.  **Aqueous NH4Cl:** This is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyl lithium intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group has been completely removed and replaced with a C=C double bond between positions 1 and 6.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing C=C double bonds and for the hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n*   **Reactions occurring:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The C=C bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is hydrogenated, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-O-CH₂Ph) is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen breaks, regenerating the alcohol and forming toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   C(ring)-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → C(ring)-CH₂-OH + Ph-CH₃ (Toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** The molecule is now a fully saturated cyclohexane ring. It has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). These substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n*   **Name of Product 4:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The parent structure is cyclohexylmethanol. There is an isopropyl group at the 3-position relative to the hydroxymethyl group. Thus, the name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy following the reaction sequence, the final product is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. This structure corresponds to **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This product results if the benzyl ether is not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This product did not undergo the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the pathway for a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.** This matches the structure derived from the full reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze the structure. It's a six-membered ring containing a ketone at position 1 (C1=O). At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The substituents at positions 3 and 5 are in a 1,3-relationship relative to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the starting material. The hydroxyl proton (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20).\n    *   NaH removes the proton from the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O- Na+).\n    *   This alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr), displacing the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n    *   The -OH group is thus protected as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   The ketone functional group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.\n    *   The reaction is an acid-catalyzed condensation, eliminating a molecule of water to form a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. The structure is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction.\n    *   The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a very strong base, n-BuLi.\n    *   The base sequentially removes two protons: first from the NH group and then from the carbon atom α to the C=N bond (i.e., from C2 or C6 of the ring). Deprotonation at C6 is generally favored to avoid steric hindrance from the substituent at C3.\n    *   This leads to the elimination of the toluenesulfinate anion (Ts-) and a molecule of nitrogen gas (N2), generating a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The final step is quenching this intermediate with a proton source (water from the aqueous NH4Cl workup).\n    *   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively reducing the ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The molecule now contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   H2 with Pd/C is a standard and potent combination for reducing several functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n        1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n        2.  The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is hydrogenated, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved, and the benzyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. The -CH2OBn group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   **Putting it all together for Product 4:**\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring has been converted to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The substituent at C3, -CH2OH, which was protected and then deprotected, is restored.\n    *   The substituent at C5, the isopropenyl group, is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents are in a 1,3-relationship, as they were on carbons 3 and 5 of the original ring.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** The IUPAC name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet's match this final structure with the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether were not cleaved.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This name accurately describes the final product derived from the reaction sequence.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is a complex hydrazide structure inconsistent with the reactions.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the case in a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe reaction sequence described involves four distinct steps in organic synthesis. A detailed analysis of each step leads to the final structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains a primary alcohol functional group (-CH₂OH). Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, a classic Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\nProduct 1, a ketone, is treated with *p*-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazide to form a *p*-toluenesulfonylhydrazone, also known as a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of *n*-butyllithium (*n*-BuLi), a strong base. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. The base first deprotonates the hydrazone nitrogen and then a carbon atom alpha (adjacent) to the C=N double bond. This leads to the elimination of the tosyl group and dinitrogen gas (N₂), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is regioselective, with deprotonation typically occurring at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon. In this case, the double bond forms between C1 and C6 of the ring. Subsequent quenching with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing condition has three effects on the molecule:\n1.  The carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n2.  The carbon-carbon double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n3.  The benzyl ether is cleaved via hydrogenolysis to form an alcohol and toluene (which is removed during workup). While some conditions can selectively hydrogenate alkenes without cleaving benzyl ethers, standard H₂ with Pd/C is known to efficiently perform both reductions.\n\nCombining these transformations, the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\nProduct 1, which contains a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a standard reaction to convert a ketone into a tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), at low temperature, followed by a proton source (aqueous ammonium chloride). This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The reaction converts the tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the tosylhydrazone group and forming a double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted α-carbon, which in this case would be between C1 and C6. The aqueous ammonium chloride then quenches the reaction, protonating the intermediate vinyllithium species.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing condition affects multiple functional groups:\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group are reduced to single bonds.\n*   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, converting the ether back into an alcohol (-OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct. This is a standard deprotection method, although it can sometimes be inhibited by certain additives.\n\nThe final transformations are:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n*   The (benzyloxy)methyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the options provided:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect, this is the product before the final deprotection step.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol and a ketone. It is treated first with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl group proton is significantly more acidic than any α-protons of the ketone, so NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The alkoxide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide and displacing the bromide ion to form a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1, a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group condenses with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide to form a C=N double bond, eliminating a molecule of water.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is subjected to the conditions of a Shapiro reaction. It is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), at low temperature. The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H group of the hydrazone, and the second equivalent removes a proton from the carbon atom alpha to the C=N bond. The resulting intermediate eliminates diimide (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium species. This vinyllithium is then protonated during the aqueous ammonium chloride workup to yield an alkene. The regioselectivity of the Shapiro reaction typically favors the formation of the less substituted, kinetic alkene product. In this case, the double bond forms between C1 and the less substituted C6 position.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). These are standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction will reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleave the benzyl ether through hydrogenolysis. Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated to form single bonds. Simultaneously, the benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) will be cleaved to regenerate the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   The benzyl ether is cleaved back to a primary alcohol.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the four consecutive reactions, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Comparing this structure to the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **This matches the derived structure.**\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction is an elimination, not an addition of the butyl group, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone moiety.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the intermediate before the final hydrogenolysis step that cleaves the benzyl ether.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and then BnBr**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an electrophilic alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first part will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn). The ketone and the isopropenyl group do not react.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and HCl**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazine).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. Under acidic catalysis (HCl), the ketone carbonyl group condenses with the primary amine of tosylhydrazide to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The other functional groups (benzyl ether, alkene) are unchanged.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **The p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base.\n    *   Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a mild proton source for quenching the reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates both the N-H proton of the hydrazone and an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The cyclohexanone ring has α-protons at C2 and C6. Deprotonation at the less sterically hindered position (C6) is kinetically favored. Abstraction of the C6 proton leads to an intermediate that eliminates dinitrogen gas (N2) and the tosylsulfinate anion to form a vinyllithium species.\n*   **Workup:** Quenching with aqueous NH4Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The C=O group of the original ketone is replaced with a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted α-carbon (C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative with the double bond between C1 and C6. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are retained.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (The relative positions of the substituents are 1,3 on the ring, which corresponds to positions C3 and C5 on the original ketone).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, which contains three reducible groups: two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl group) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** H2 (hydrogen gas) and Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The Pd/C catalyst with H2 will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** These conditions are also standard for the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and the ether is converted back to an alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n*   **Product 4:** All reducible groups are transformed.\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is now saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 (original numbering) is now an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group at C3 (original numbering) is now a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   **Final Structure and Name:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at a 1,3-relative position. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol has priority. The carbon bearing the -CH2OH group is part of the \"methanol\" parent name, and the ring is the substituent. The ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (C1) such that the isopropyl group gets the lowest possible locant (C3).\n    *   Name of Product 4: **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**\n\n**Comparing with the Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. No butyl addition occurs, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone moiety would have been removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product obtained after the four-step sequence.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the structure if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is highly unlikely under H2/Pd/C conditions.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's first visualize the starting molecule. It is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a ketone group at position 1 (`-one`), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH), followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Sodium Hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr, PhCH2Br)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis). This displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn or -OCH2Ph). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n*   This is a classic reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone functional group at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.\n*   The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under acidic catalysis.\n*   **Product 2:** A tosylhydrazone is formed. The C=O group of the ketone is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group. The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of Product 1**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   This set of reagents applied to a tosylhydrazone constitutes a **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. It will abstract two acidic protons in succession: first the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone, and then a proton from the carbon atom α to the C=N bond (the former C6 or C2 of the ring).\n*   This results in a dianion, which then undergoes spontaneous elimination of nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The original C1 carbon (from the ketone) is now part of a C=C double bond and bears the lithium atom.\n*   **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)** is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium to give a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of the ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The oxygen atom is removed, and a double bond is formed adjacent to the original carbonyl position. The structure is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions.\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is hydrogenated to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A key reaction catalyzed by Pd/C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken by hydrogen (hydrogenolysis).\n    *   The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH3), which is removed during workup.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group (from the original isopropenyl group at C5) and a hydroxymethyl group (from the original benzylated hydroxymethyl group at C3). The relative positions of these two groups are 1,3 on the cyclohexane ring. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if only hydrogenation of the double bonds occurred, without the cleavage of the benzyl ether. This is an incomplete reaction.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure incorrectly retains the tosylhydrazide moiety, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure would arise if n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the described reaction pathway.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches the outcome of the complete, four-step reaction sequence as described.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the multi-step synthesis to identify the structure of Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Starting Material with NaH and Benzyl Bromide**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Process**:\n    1.  NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the hydroxymethyl substituent. This forms a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction).\n    3.  This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OCH₂Ph). This step serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from reacting in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1**: The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Process**: This is a classic reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative.

An alkene (the isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position C5.\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is much more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n    *   **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** This is an alkylating agent.\n    *   **The Reaction:** The resulting alkoxide ion is a potent nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction.

The ketone and the alkene functionalities do not react under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxyl group has been converted to a benzyl ether (-O-CH2-Ph, abbreviated as -OBn).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a derivative of hydrazine.\n    *   **The Reaction:** Aldehydes and ketones react with hydrazines under acidic catalysis in a condensation reaction to form hydrazones.

Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe reaction sequence is analyzed step-by-step to determine the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n    The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains a primary alcohol. In the first step, it is treated with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis. The result is the protection of the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are not affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone, commonly known as a tosylhydrazone. This is a standard condensation reaction where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n    *   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n*   **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n    The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), at a low temperature. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. The strong base removes two protons, leading to the elimination of the p-toluenesulfinate anion and nitrogen gas (N₂), which forms a vinyllithium species. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate by providing a proton source, resulting in the formation of an alkene where the ketone used to be. The reaction typically forms the less substituted (kinetic) alkene product.\n    *   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n    Product 3, which contains two alkene groups (one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether, is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation over Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing system will:\n    1.  Reduce the alkene in the cyclohexene ring to an alkane (cyclohexane).\n    2.  Reduce the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    3.  Cleave the benzyl ether via hydrogenolysis to regenerate the primary alcohol and produce toluene as a byproduct. The cleavage of benzyl ethers under these conditions is a common and efficient reaction.\n    *   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the options provided:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure still contains the tosylhydrazide functionality, which was removed in step 3.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This structure perfectly matches the deduced final product.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure is incorrect as it implies a different reaction pathway for the Shapiro reaction reagents.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. It has an alcohol and a ketone functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of acid. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1, specifically N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a very strong base. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, two equivalents of the strong base convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, with the loss of nitrogen gas and the tosyl group. The ketone is effectively replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium intermediate to form the final alkene.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers (hydrogenolysis).\n*   The isopropenyl double bond is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   The cyclohexene double bond is reduced to saturate the ring, forming a cyclohexane.\n*   The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the primary alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n\nTherefore, the final product has a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group as substituents.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is C.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group, which is the most acidic proton in the starting material. The resulting alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The product is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by =N-NHTs.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone derivative, **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 with n-butyllithium, then aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium. This process eliminates the entire tosylhydrazone group and replaces it with a carbon-carbon double bond. The deprotonation occurs preferentially at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is C-6 in this case. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, a proton source, to yield the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C-1 is removed, and a double bond is formed between C-1 and C-6. The product is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a standard catalyst for this process.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is also a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers to yield an alcohol and toluene. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) will be reduced to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). While certain conditions or additives can prevent this cleavage, standard hydrogenation conditions typically cause it.\n*   **Product 4:** The combination of these transformations results in a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in step 3.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway for the Shapiro reaction and fails to account for the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the product derived from the full reaction sequence.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only hydrogenation occurred without the cleavage of the benzyl ether, which is unlikely under these conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first draw the structure of the starting material.\n*   `cyclohexan-1-one`: A six-membered ring containing a ketone (C=O) group at position 1.\n*   `3-(hydroxymethyl)`: A -CH₂OH group attached to carbon 3.\n*   `5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)`: An isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] attached to carbon 5.\nThe positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other with respect to C1.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /    \\\nC6    C3--CH₂OH\n|      |\nC5-----C4\n|\nC(CH₃)=CH₂\n```\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide.\n    R-CH₂-OH + NaH → R-CH₂-O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **BnBr (benzyl bromide, PhCH₂Br):** The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH₂-O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl double bond are unaffected.\n    Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-BuLi:** Two equivalents of this strong base are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   **aq. NH₄Cl:** The vinyllithium intermediate is quenched with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, to give an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the conversion of the ketone into an alkene. Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative, containing a double bond where the ketone was. It still has the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. The relative 1,3-disposition of the substituents is preserved.\n    An example structure for Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several transformations.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, deprotecting the alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-Bn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their original 1,3- (or meta-) relationship on the ring.\n*   The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl group would be removed by hydrogenolysis, and the butyl group from BuLi is not added in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by Pd/C and H₂.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated during the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both double bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether in Product 3.\n\nThe final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe four-step reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n**Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr). NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl groups remain unchanged. Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). This reaction converts the ketone into a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (tosylhydrazone) through a condensation reaction, where a molecule of water is eliminated. Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This is a Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used to convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, with the loss of nitrogen gas and toluenesulfinate. The subsequent aqueous workup protonates the vinyllithium species to form an alkene. This reaction effectively removes the ketone functionality and replaces it with a carbon-carbon double bond. Product 3 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The catalyst Pd/C with H₂ gas reduces carbon-carbon double bonds. In Product 3, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated (reduced) to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols. Therefore, the benzyl ether group is cleaved to a hydroxymethyl group.\n\nThe final product, product 4, is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, specifically **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect, the tosylhydrazone group is removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct, this matches the deduced structure of Product 4.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect, this would result from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile on the ketone, not a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect, this is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This is a cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at C1, a hydroxymethyl (-CH₂OH) group at C3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at C5.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Mechanism:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a sodium alkoxide (-O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction).\n    *   **Product 1:** The -CH₂OH group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn, where Bn is benzyl, -CH₂Ph). The rest of the molecule is unchanged. Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (the ketone from the previous step).\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The ketone functional group reacts with tosylhydrazide under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is replaced by =N-NHTs.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- group of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates a proton on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond. This leads to an unstable intermediate that eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, forming a vinyllithium species. The subsequent addition of aqueous NH₄Cl (a mild proton source) quenches this intermediate, protonating the vinyllithium to form an alkene. The C=O group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position.\n    *   **Product 3:** An alkene where the cyclohexanone ring has become a cyclohexene ring. The other groups (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are unchanged. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 4:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (the di-alkene with a benzyl ether).\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has three effects on Product 3:\n        1.  It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring.\n        2.  It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond of the isopropenyl group, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n        3.  It cleaves the benzyl ether via hydrogenolysis, converting the benzyloxymethyl group back into a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Structure:**\n    *   The final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n    *   Let's compare this with the given options:\n        *   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect.

The ketone and the alkene group are unaffected.\n    *   Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazine derivative in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water to form a C=N bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction specifically targets the ketone/aldehyde functional group and is the preparatory step for elimination reactions like the Shapiro or Bamford-Stevens reactions.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction.\n    *   n-Butyllithium is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-proton (on the carbon adjacent to the C=N group).\n    *   The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as a sulfinate salt). This forms a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the reaction by protonating the vinyllithium species.\n    *   The overall result is the deoxygenation of the ketone to an alkene. The carbonyl group at position 1 is replaced by a double bond between C1 and one of the adjacent carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Careful Point:** Recognize that n-BuLi functions as a base, not a nucleophile, in this context. The Shapiro reaction is a key method for converting ketones into alkenes. The regiochemistry of the double bond formation is not crucial here because the next step saturates the entire ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative where the original ketone is gone, replaced by a C=C bond. The molecule now contains a benzyl ether, an isopropenyl group, and a double bond within the six-membered ring.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a powerful reduction method. It will affect multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n    2.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** The C=C double bond of the isopropenyl group will also be reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a form of deprotection). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common oversight is forgetting that H₂/Pd-C can do more than just reduce C=C bonds. The cleavage of benzyl ethers (hydrogenolysis) is a critical transformation in this step.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring. The substituent that was originally the isopropenyl group is now an isopropyl group. The substituent that was the protected hydroxymethyl group is now back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The relative 1,3-positions of these two substituents on the ring are preserved. The structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, with the given options.\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved. Incorrect.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This results from an incorrect reaction pathway for the tosylhydrazone. Incorrect.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This results from the incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile. Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This name correctly describes the final product we have deduced, a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This is the correct structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material Analysis**\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A ketone functional group (=O) at position C1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position C3.\n*   A prop-1-en-2-yl group (also known as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position C5.\n\nThe key functional groups that can react are the alcohol (-OH), the ketone (C=O), and the alkene (C=C).\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then BnBr**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (pKa ~16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an S_N2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and cat. HCl**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a hydrazine derivative. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazine derivatives under acidic conditions to form hydrazones. The ketone at C1 condenses with TsNHNH₂ to form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide. The ketone C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-BuLi, then aqueous NH₄Cl**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Aqueous ammonium chloride is for workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base.\n    1.  The first n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton.\n    2.  The second n-BuLi deprotonates a proton on a carbon α to the hydrazone (either C2 or C6).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and p-toluenesulfinate anion to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between C1 and the deprotonated α-carbon (e.g., C1=C2).\n    4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Net Result:** The ketone is converted into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The double bond is at the position of the original ketone. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with H₂, Pd/C**\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) with a Palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which has two major effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Pd/C is an excellent catalyst for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers (O-Bn bond). This is called hydrogenolysis. The benzyloxy group is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   -CH₂-O-Bn → -CH₂-OH\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane skeleton. The isopropenyl group at C5 is now an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group at C3 is now a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3 relationship.\n\n**Determining the Final Structure and Name**\nThe final molecule is 3-isopropyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane (the numbering reflects the original scheme). A more systematic name, assigning C1 to the carbon bearing the substituent, would be (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure retains the tosylhydrazone, meaning the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation haven't fully occurred.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if only hydrogenation of the alkenes occurred, but not the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. With Pd/C, hydrogenolysis is expected.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies the addition of a butyl group, which doesn't happen in this reaction sequence.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name describes a methanol molecule substituted with a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group, which is equivalent to a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl (-CH₂OH) group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe multi-step synthesis transforms 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one into (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Product 1 Formation**\n    The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (Product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 2 Formation**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic acid. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction yields N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide (Product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 3 Formation**\n    Product 2 undergoes a Shapiro reaction upon treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature. In this reaction, two equivalents of the strong base are used to convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, which eliminates nitrogen gas. The reaction regioselectivity is controlled by the deprotonation of the carbon alpha to the hydrazone, with the base typically removing the less sterically hindered proton. In this case, the proton at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species to yield an alkene. This step effectively removes the original ketone functional group and forms a double bond, resulting in 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (Product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 4 Formation**\n    Product 3 is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This final step involves catalytic hydrogenation. The conditions are sufficient to reduce both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group—to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene into a cyclohexane ring. Concurrently, Pd/C catalysis with H2 is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which removes the benzyl protecting group and regenerates the alcohol. The final product is therefore (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol (Product 4).\n\nThe relative 1,3-relationship between the hydroxymethyl and isopropenyl/isopropyl substituents is maintained throughout the entire sequence.\n\nThus, the final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. It is first treated with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base. The NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr). The alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which forms a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl). The ketone functional group of the cyclohexanone ring reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms from the amino group of the hydrazide are eliminated as water.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at a low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench. These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The n-BuLi, a strong base, deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene product. The original carbonyl group is effectively removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring at that position.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This process reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers through hydrogenolysis.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n*   The benzyl ether is cleaved, converting the benzyloxymethyl group back to a hydroxymethyl group.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group at position 5 and a hydroxymethyl group at position 3.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches the derived structure.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation products.\nD) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure implies the Shapiro reaction did not occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThe user has presented a multi-step synthesis problem and asked for the structure of the final product. I will analyze each step of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the intermediates and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\nProduct 1 is a ketone, which reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a condensation reaction that forms a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (tosylhydrazone).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This initiates a Shapiro reaction, where the ketone is converted into an alkene. The reaction involves deprotonation of the hydrazone and an α-carbon, followed by elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup with ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species, yielding an alkene where the ketone was originally located.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\nProduct 3 has two carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group) and a benzyl ether. It is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This versatile reagent will reduce both C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds. Specifically, the isopropenyl group will be reduced to an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene ring will become a cyclohexane ring. Concurrently, Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for the cleavage (hydrogenolysis) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols.\n\n*   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) is cleaved back to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first draw the structure of the starting material.\n*   It has a cyclohexanone backbone (a six-membered ring with a ketone group).\n*   The ketone carbonyl group is at position C1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is at position C3.\n*   A prop-1-en-2-yl group (commonly known as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) is at position C5.\n\nThe structure has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + Ph-CH2Br → R-CH2-O-CH2Ph + NaBr\n\nThis step effectively protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreactive under these conditions.\n\n**Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The nucleophilic amino group (-NH2) of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. Subsequent dehydration (loss of H2O), catalyzed by acid (HCl), yields the tosylhydrazone.\n    R₂C=O + H₂NNHTs → R₂C=NNHTs + H₂O\n\nThe ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n\n**Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexanone.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone to an alkene. It requires at least two equivalents of a strong base, like n-butyllithium.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (a proton on C2 or C6).\n    3.  This intermediate collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium species.\n    4.  The reaction is then quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl) to protonate the vinyllithium, forming the final alkene product.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond, effectively a deoxygenation reaction. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the adjacent carbon that was deprotonated (C2 or C6).\n\n**Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative. Specifically, a molecule with a cyclohexene ring, a benzyloxymethyl substituent, and an isopropenyl substituent. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful reducing system that affects several functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated) to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Benzyl ethers are readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and a hydrogen atom is added to each fragment.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH] + Toluene [CH₃Ph].\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

The NaH removes the proton from the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide intermediate: R-CH2O⁻ Na⁺.\n    2.  This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) in an SN2 reaction. The bromide ion is displaced.\n*   **Product 1:** This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2Ph).

The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The reaction generally has anti-Zaitsev selectivity, meaning it forms the less substituted alkene by removing a proton from the less substituted or less hindered α-carbon.\n    3.  The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating the stable p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The aqueous NH4Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond.

It will:\n    1.  **Reduce C=C bonds:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be saturated to single bonds.\n        *   `cyclohexene` → `cyclohexane`\n        *   `isopropenyl group` → `isopropyl group`\n    2.  **Cleave benzyl ethers (Hydrogenolysis):** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved, and the oxygen is hydrogenated back to an alcohol.\n        *   `benzyloxymethyl group` (-CH2OBn) → `hydroxymethyl group` (-CH2OH)\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The substituents were originally at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone, which means they are in a 1,3-relationship on the final cyclohexane ring. Naming this structure according to IUPAC rules, with the alcohol as the principal functional group, gives `(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This matches our final predicted structure.\nB) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from a misinterpretation of the Shapiro reaction, suggesting n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, and it incorrectly assumes the benzyl ether is not cleaved.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the benzyl ether, `(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)-CH₂-O-CH₂-Ph`. It is incorrect because catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is expected to cleave the benzyl ether.\n\nThe correct sequence of transformations leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ~16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an S_N2 reaction (Williamson Ether Synthesis). This protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone.\n*   **Reaction:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones and aldehydes under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents defines the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). This leads to the formation of a dianion, which then eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl anion to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene. This reaction effectively replaces the original ketone with a double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation using H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method that will cause two transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds. The cyclohexene ring will become a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] will become an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is the classic reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The molecule is fully saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this final structure:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is removed in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This structure still has the benzyl ether protecting group, which is removed in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This would be the product of a different reaction (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi to the ketone), not the Shapiro reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a summary of the full reasoning process leading to the final answer.\n\n*   **Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and Benzyl Bromide.**\n    *   The starting material has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic functional group, which is the alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) over the ketone's alpha-protons (pKa ≈ 20). This forms a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (S_N2 reaction).\n    *   **Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol has been protected as a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂).**\n    *   This is the standard reaction for forming a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The nucleophilic -NH₂ group of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n    *   **Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).**\n    *   This reaction is a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base and deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice (once on the NH group, and once on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond).\n    *   The resulting unstable dianion eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   Subsequent quenching with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone C=O group with a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product 3** is a cyclohexene derivative, specifically 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C and H₂.**\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon is a powerful catalyst that will reduce several groups in Product 3.\n    1.  The alkene within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to an alkane, saturating the ring.\n    2.  The alkene of the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an alkane, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  The benzyl ether protecting group is removed via hydrogenolysis. The benzylic C-O bond is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol and forming toluene as a byproduct.\n    *   The final structure has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The substituents, an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, are in a 1,3-relationship, preserved from the starting material.\n    *   **Product 4** is therefore **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Comparing the final structure with the given options, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol perfectly matches option A. The name \"propan-2-yl\" is the systematic IUPAC term for the common name \"isopropyl\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, possesses both a ketone and a primary alcohol functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the hydroxyl proton of the alcohol. This forms a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction known as the Williamson ether synthesis. This results in the formation of a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction is a standard method for derivatizing ketones and aldehydes.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2, the tosylhydrazone, is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This initiates the Shapiro reaction. The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the nitrogen of the hydrazone, and the second equivalent deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting intermediate eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. This intermediate is then protonated during the aqueous ammonium chloride workup to yield an alkene. The double bond forms where the ketone was, specifically regioselectively at the less sterically hindered position.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This versatile reagent reduces multiple functional groups.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The double bond of the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   Crucially, Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation also cleaves benzyl ethers (hydrogenolysis) to yield the corresponding alcohol and toluene as a byproduct.\n\nCombining these transformations, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane ring, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches the derived structure.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the result if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure incorrectly implies the tosylhydrazone survived the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure suggests an incorrect reaction pathway for the Shapiro reaction (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi).\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe chemical transformation occurs in four sequential steps. Let's analyze each one:\n\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which in this case is the one from the hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming an alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether. The product, **Product 1**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic acid. The ketone functional group reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The carbonyl group (C=O) of the cyclohexanone is converted to a C=N-NHTs group. **Product 2** is therefore N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench. This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi). The first deprotonates the nitrogen, and the second removes a proton from the carbon alpha to the original ketone. Deprotonation occurs at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon. Following elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas, a vinyllithium intermediate is formed, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. This sequence effectively replaces the ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond. The resulting **Product 3** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This powerful reducing condition has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the alcohol. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, yielding an alcohol and toluene as a byproduct.\n\nCombining these transformations, the benzyl ether is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group, the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene ring is saturated to a cyclohexane ring. The final structure, **Product 4**, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This would result from the reduction of the isopropenyl group and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether without the Shapiro reaction taking place.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies the n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile attacking the ketone, and that the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This structure indicates that the benzyl ether remained intact, which is unlikely under catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd/C.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches the final product after the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the hydroxyl group**\n    The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. It has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group). Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl group of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether. The product of this step, **Product 1**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This reaction is a standard method for forming benzyl ethers.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of a tosylhydrazone**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also called tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a standard condensation reaction. The resulting **Product 2** is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n*   **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n    Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a strong base, at low temperature. This initiates a Shapiro reaction, which converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base are required. The first deprotonates the nitrogen, and the second removes a proton from the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl carbon. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate by protonation, yielding an alkene. The original ketone group at C1 is effectively removed and replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. Regioselectivity is controlled by the deprotonation of the alpha-proton; typically the less sterically hindered proton is removed, which in this case would lead to the formation of the double bond between C1 and C6. **Product 3** is therefore 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n    Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This powerful reducing system will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds present in the molecule. Additionally, Pd/C is a standard and effective catalyst for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, converting them back to alcohols.\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyl ether group is cleaved, regenerating the hydroxymethyl group.\n\nThe final structure, **Product 4**, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This corresponds to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This molecule contains a primary alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The strong base, NaH, deprotonates the most acidic proton, which belongs to the hydroxyl group of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18) rather than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.

A tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is critical to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a base in this context, not as a nucleophile. A common mistake is to assume the butyl group adds to the molecule.\n*   The reaction eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate.

This powerful reduction step affects multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene to cyclohexane and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:**\n        *   **Careful Point:** A crucial aspect of this step is that H₂/Pd-C is a standard and efficient reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers, a process called hydrogenolysis. This reaction removes the benzyl protecting group and regenerates the original alcohol. Forgetting this deprotection step is a frequent error.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** The transformations result in a saturated cyclohexane ring.

It's a cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at C1. At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /  \\\nC6  C3--CH2OH\n|   |\nC5--C4\n|\nC(CH3)=CH2\n```\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr)** is an electrophile. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a good nucleophile and will attack the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n3.  The -CH2OH group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group, -CH2-O-CH2Ph (-CH2OBn). This protects the alcohol group from the reagents in the subsequent steps.\n\n**Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /  \\\nC6  C3--CH2-O-Bn\n|   |\nC5--C4\n|\nC(CH3)=CH2\n```\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n1.

This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**. A tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong, non-hindered base like n-BuLi.\n2.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon with the least steric hindrance. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less substituted than C2 (which is adjacent to the C3 substituent). Therefore, C6 is deprotonated.\n3.  The resulting dianion eliminates p-toluenesulfinate (Ts-) and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) workup protonates the vinyllithium species.\n5.  The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of the ketone into an alkene, with the double bond formed at the less substituted side.\n\n**Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (The numbering of the ring changes based on IUPAC rules for alkenes, but the connectivity relative to the original skeleton is a double bond between C1 and C6).\n\n```\n     C6=C1--C2\n    /       |\n  C5--------C3--CH2-O-Bn\n  |         |\n  C(CH3)=CH2 C4\n```\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Pd/C is a heterogeneous catalyst that is very effective for several types of reductions.\n2.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C1=C6) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (hydrogenated) to single bonds.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group (-OBn) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis under these conditions. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon breaks, and the resulting fragments are capped with hydrogen.\n    *   The -CH2-O-Bn group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2-OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH3).\n\n**Product 4:**\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product has:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   An isopropyl group at the position corresponding to the original C5.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group at the position corresponding to the original C3.\n\nThe resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol function takes priority. The molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The substituent attached to the methanol carbon is a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group.\n\n**Final Product Name:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone has reacted in step 3.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches our derived structure.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is unlikely with H2/Pd-C.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol (the most acidic proton) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazine) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). This reaction converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone through a condensation reaction, where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonate the hydrazone and then the less-substituted α-carbon. The intermediate then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by the aqueous ammonium chloride to yield an alkene. The ketone at position 1 is thus removed and replaced by a double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The major product will have the double bond formed between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted adjacent carbon (C6). The isopropenyl and benzyloxymethyl groups remain.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. These conditions are standard for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be reduced. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a very common and effective method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, converting them back to alcohols.\n*   **Final Transformation:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, the cyclohexene is reduced to a cyclohexane, and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to the primary alcohol.\n\nThe final structure, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Based on the numbering of the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The butyl group from n-BuLi does not add to the molecule in a Shapiro reaction, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches the expected outcome of the full reaction sequence.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This represents an unreacted or partially reacted intermediate.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is unlikely under these standard hydrogenation conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the structure of product 4:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic functional group, which is the alcohol (-OH). The resulting alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. This reaction protects the alcohol group. The ketone and alkene remain unchanged. Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of acid. This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone functional group is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and alkene) are not affected. Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This is a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group, and the formation of an alkene where the ketone used to be. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon and the less-substituted adjacent carbon. The subsequent quench with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the intermediate to yield the final alkene. Product 3 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** Product 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This powerful reducing condition has two effects here:\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds. The alkene in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain are both reduced to alkanes (a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively).\n    *   It causes hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether, cleaving the C-O bond and converting the protected alcohol back into a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n\n5.  **Determine Final Structure:** Combining these transformations, the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** Comparing this structure to the given choices, it matches option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the multi-step synthesis problem and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options provided in the problem\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\",\n        \"B\": \"(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\",\n        \"C\": \"3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol\",\n        \"D\": \"(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene\"\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence\n    # Step 1: Williamson ether synthesis protects the alcohol.\n    # Starting material: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n    # Product 1: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n    # Step 2: Tosylhydrazone formation from the ketone.\n    # Product 2: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n    # Step 3: Shapiro reaction converts the tosylhydrazone to an alkene.\n    # Product 3: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n    # Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) reduces both alkenes and cleaves the benzyl ether (hydrogenolysis).\n    # - The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n    # - The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    # - The benzyl ether is cleaved back to a primary alcohol.\n    # Final Product (Product 4): (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\n    # The derived final product matches option B.\n    final_answer_choice = \"B\"\n    final_answer_structure = options[final_answer_choice]\n\n    print(f\"The final product of the reaction sequence is {final_answer_structure}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is {final_answer_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\nThe correct option is B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Key functional groups:** Ketone, primary alcohol, alkene.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** This is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reaction:** The alcohol group is protected as a benzyl ether.\n    -CH2OH → -CH2O⁻ → -CH2-O-CH2-Ph (or -CH2OBn)\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide:** This reagent reacts with aldehydes and ketones.\n    2.  **HCl (catalyst):** The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and accelerating the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule).\n    C=O → C=N-NHTs\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. Its systematic name is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** This is a very strong base. The reaction of a tosylhydrazone with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi is known as the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** n-BuLi first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, then a second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond. The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl):** This is a mild proton source used in the workup to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction is a method for converting a ketone into an alkene. The original C=O group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon and one of its adjacent α-carbons.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The structure is a substituted cyclohexene, for example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The exact position of the newly formed double bond is not critical for determining the final product.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) will be reduced to single bonds (C-C). This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be hydrogenated.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** A key reaction catalyzed by Pd/C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers (and benzyl esters, benzylamines, etc.). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken, and hydrogen atoms are added.\n        *   Benzyl ether [-CH2-O-Bn] → Alcohol [-CH2-OH] + Toluene [Ph-CH3]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product will have a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the original hydroxymethyl group. The substituents on the ring are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship from the starting material.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Evaluation:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is a benzyl ether. The benzyl ether is cleaved in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not its role in the Shapiro reaction. It also incorrectly retains the benzyl ether.\n\nThe final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **NaH (Sodium Hydride):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **BnBr (Benzyl Bromide):** An electrophilic alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The sodium alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The alcohol group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The benzyl group (Bn) acts as a protecting group for the alcohol.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide in a condensation reaction (similar to imine formation) to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-BuLi (n-butyllithium):** A very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used.\n    2.  **Aqueous NH₄Cl:** Used for workup to protonate the intermediate.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene.\n    *   The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    *   The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    *   The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate anion), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous NH₄Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone group is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C double bond in the ring. The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes part of this new double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (the exact position of the double bond could be C1-C2 or C1-C6, but this does not affect the final product's constitution).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which has two effects here:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group is broken, and the oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        *   -CH₂OBn → -CH₂OH\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The relative 1,3-positioning of these substituents on the ring is maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this compound is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate (related to Product 2), not the final product.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product. It has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect. It contains a butyl group (from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile, which doesn't happen in a Shapiro reaction) and retains the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by hydrogenation.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the benzyl ether of the final product. It would be the result if the hydrogenation did not cleave the protecting group, which is incorrect for Pd/C catalysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol (-OH) group to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl (prop-1-en-2-yl) groups remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal amine of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench. This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, a tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong organolithium base. This process converts the ketone into an alkene by forming a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. The overall result is the replacement of the C=O group with a C=C double bond. The double bond forms at the position of the original ketone, resulting in a cyclohexene ring.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard and effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers to regenerate the corresponding alcohol. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is reduced back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this structure to the given options:\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. A butyl group is added, and the benzyl ether is intact.\nB) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone, not the final product after the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation.\nC) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the predicted product from the full reaction sequence.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis is a very common outcome under these conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide.\n*   **Function of reagents**: Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which in this case is the hydroxyl (-OH) group of the alcohol. This forms a sodium alkoxide. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction**: The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the primary alcohol into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the alkene (isopropenyl group) remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1**: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosyl hydrazide) in the presence of catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   **Function of reagents**: p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form tosylhydrazones. The acid catalyzes the condensation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at the C1 position of the cyclohexanone ring condenses with the tosyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2**: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride workup.\n*   **Function of reagents**: This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi are used to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the formation of a vinyllithium intermediate with the elimination of nitrogen gas and the tosyl group. The aqueous ammonium chloride then quenches the vinyllithium species by protonating it.\n*   **Reaction**: The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted adjacent carbon. In this case, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3**: (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Function of reagents**: Pd/C with H₂ is a powerful system for catalytic hydrogenation. It is commonly used to reduce carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds. It is also very effective for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers to form an alcohol and toluene.\n*   **Reaction**: Both alkene groups in Product 3 (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group) will be reduced to alkanes. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. Simultaneously, the benzyl ether will be cleaved back to the primary alcohol. While conditions can sometimes be tuned to prevent debenzylation, standard hydrogenation with Pd/C typically cleaves benzyl ethers, especially in the presence of other reducible groups like alkenes.\n*   **Product 4**: The complete reduction and hydrogenolysis result in (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies a different reaction pathway.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This implies the Shapiro reaction did not proceed to completion.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the predicted product after all four reaction steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe search results confirm the predicted reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The reaction of an alcohol with sodium hydride (NaH) to form an alkoxide, followed by reaction with benzyl bromide, is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Ketones react with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form p-toluenesulfonylhydrazones (tosylhydrazones).\n*   **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** The treatment of a tosylhydrazone with two equivalents of a strong base like n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) converts the ketone into an alkene. The reaction proceeds by deprotonation of the hydrazone, followed by deprotonation of the less substituted alpha-carbon, elimination of the tosyl group, loss of nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. This effectively removes the carbonyl group and creates a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) is a common and effective catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes. This same catalytic system is also standard for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers to yield an alcohol and toluene. Therefore, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced, and the benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved.\n\nBased on this confirmed reaction sequence:\n1.  The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is converted to **Product 1**, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n2.  Product 1 is converted to **Product 2**, the corresponding tosylhydrazone at the C1 position.\n3.  Product 2 undergoes a Shapiro reaction to form **Product 3**, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n4.  Product 3 is treated with H2 and Pd/C. The two alkene groups are hydrogenated (prop-1-en-2-yl becomes isopropyl, and cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane), and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to an alcohol. This yields **Product 4**, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of several steps.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the predicted product after the full reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) and Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains two acidic functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and a ketone. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   **Reagent 1: NaH.** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will selectively deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl Bromide (BnBr).** The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines (like tosylhydrazide) in a condensation reaction to form hydrazones. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the nitrogen atom of the hydrazone (-NH-Ts).\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon atom α to the C=N bond that is less sterically hindered. In this case, both α-carbons (C2 and C6) are CH₂ groups, but the reaction typically proceeds via deprotonation at the less hindered site to form a dianion.\n    3.  This dianion is unstable and collapses. It eliminates the tosylsulfinate anion (-Ts) and a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂), which is an excellent leaving group.\n    4.  This process generates a vinyllithium intermediate, where the lithium atom is attached to the carbon that was originally the carbonyl carbon.\n    5.  The final step is quenching the reaction with a proton source, such as aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n*   **Outcome:** The Shapiro reaction effectively replaces the original ketone group with a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the adjacent α-carbon (C6 or C2).\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring is converted to a cyclohexene ring. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are retained.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or a regioisomer, but the final product's constitution will be the same).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Under these standard conditions, several transformations occur:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group are reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken by hydrogen, a process called hydrogenolysis. This regenerates the original alcohol and produces toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl ether would be cleaved, and the butyl group from n-BuLi is not incorporated into the product in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final structure: a cyclohexane ring with a 1,3-substitution pattern of an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether were not cleaved. Standard hydrogenation with Pd/C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This implies the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) did not occur.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule has a cyclohexanone core.\n*   At C1: a ketone group (C=O).\n*   At C3: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5: an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\nThe substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.**\n*   This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone at C1 condenses with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The acid (HCl) catalyzes the reaction.\n    R₂C=O + H₂NNHTs → R₂C=NNHTs + H₂O\n\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n*   This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**. The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is adjacent to the substituent at C3, making it more sterically hindered than C6. Therefore, deprotonation occurs at C6.\n2.  The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate), to form a vinyllithium intermediate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n3.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** is a mild proton source that quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium to form the final alkene.\n\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is effectively removed and replaced by a double bond. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. (The double bond is between C1 and C6).\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for this process.\n*   This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be saturated.\n        *   cyclohexene → cyclohexane\n        *   isopropenyl group → isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen, regenerating the alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   R-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → R-OH + PhCH₃ (Toluene)\n\n*   **Applying these transformations to Product 3:**\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The 3-((benzyloxy)methyl) group becomes a 3-(hydroxymethyl) group.\n    *   The 5-(prop-1-en-2-yl) group becomes a 5-(isopropyl) group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet's compare this final structure with the given options:\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl group should be removed, and n-BuLi does not add as a butyl group in a Shapiro reaction.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect.

This molecule has three key functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (an isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the starting material. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** The alkoxide formed is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol group is converted into a benzyl ether.

The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide under acid catalysis. A molecule of water is eliminated to form a **tosylhydrazone**.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base removes two protons (from the -NH- group and the α-carbon). The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium. The overall transformation converts the original ketone into an alkene where the ketone used to be.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at position 1 is replaced by a C=C double bond, forming a cyclohexene ring.

The strong base removes two protons (first from the -NH- group, then from the carbon α to the C=N bond), leading to the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N2), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent quench with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene.

This reaction involves the condensation of the ketone with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a strong base. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene by treatment with two equivalents of a strong organolithium base. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated and replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing agent performs two transformations:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the catalyst, regenerating the primary alcohol.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is formed.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nBased on this four-step synthesis, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol functional group. In the presence of sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, the alcohol is deprotonated to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1, which contains a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of an acid catalyst. This is a condensation reaction that converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to the conditions of a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This process eliminates the tosylhydrazone group and forms a carbon-carbon double bond where the ketone was originally located. The reaction is regioselective, typically forming the less sterically hindered, or kinetic, alkene product. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride serves to quench the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This step results in two transformations:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the Pd/C and H₂ to regenerate the alcohol.\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Based on the positions in the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3- (or meta) relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is removed, and the Shapiro reaction does not add a butyl group.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved in the final step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This represents an intermediate stage or an alternative reaction pathway, not the final product after the Shapiro and hydrogenation steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr). This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol group (-OH) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. The other functional groups (ketone and alkene) are unaffected by these reagents.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This is a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) removes two protons, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>), which forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is regioselective, favoring the formation of the less substituted alkene. In this case, the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted alpha-carbon (C6). The aqueous workup then protonates the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene product.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst that will reduce all the carbon-carbon double bonds present in the molecule. This includes the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group (which becomes an isopropyl group). Furthermore, under these conditions, Pd/C will also cleave the benzyl ether via hydrogenolysis, converting it back to an alcohol.\n\n*   Reduction of alkenes: The cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group are both saturated.\n*   Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether: The benzyloxy-methyl group (-CH<sub>2</sub>OBn) is converted to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH<sub>2</sub>OH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   This is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then Benzyl Bromide**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    1.  The NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide: R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. The hydroxymethyl group becomes a (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH2OBn).\n    The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    The structure of Product 2 is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon atom α to the C=N bond.\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The aqueous NH4Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The ketone is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative. It has a double bond in the ring, the (benzyloxy)methyl group, and the isopropenyl group.\n    The structure of Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (or an isomeric cyclohexene, which leads to the same final product).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C and H₂**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is very effective at reducing multiple types of functional groups.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken.\n        *   R-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → R-OH + Ph-CH₃ (Toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). The relative positions of these two groups are 1,3 on the ring. The name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Contains a butyl group and the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone moiety would have been eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if only the hydrogenation of the alkenes occurred, but not the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. Hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct.

The ketone group remains unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   **Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n    *   This reaction is the acid-catalyzed condensation of a ketone with a hydrazide to form a hydrazone. Specifically, the ketone of Product 1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to yield a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Product 2 is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n    *   This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, a tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (like n-butyllithium) to convert the carbonyl group into a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The n-butyllithium deprotonates the hydrazone, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas (N₂), which forms a vinyllithium species. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n    *   The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position.\n    *   **Product 3 is (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a powerful reducing system.\n    *   It will reduce the two carbon-carbon double bonds present in Product 3: the one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl (prop-1-en-2-yl) group. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane.\n    *   Crucially, these conditions also cause the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of the benzyl ether, converting it back into a primary alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct. While conditions can sometimes be tuned to preserve benzyl ethers during alkene hydrogenation, standard high-pressure H₂ with Pd/C typically cleaves them.\n    *   **Product 4 is therefore (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.**\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This is the result of reducing both alkenes and cleaving the benzyl ether.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from an incorrect mechanism for the Shapiro reaction (addition of butyl anion instead of elimination).\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This implies the benzyl ether was never formed and the Shapiro reaction did not proceed to completion.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, sodium hydride (NaH), and benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material has an alcohol group (-CH2OH) and a ketone group (C=O). Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the alcohol group, forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile in a Williamson ether synthesis, attacking the benzyl bromide to form a benzyl ether (-CH2OCH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 and p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) with a catalytic amount of acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to replace the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) with a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), and aqueous ammonium chloride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which removes two protons. This intermediate then eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The subsequent aqueous workup protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene. The overall effect is the replacement of the original ketone with a double bond, typically formed at the less sterically hindered adjacent position. The double bond forms between the carbon of the original ketone (C1) and an adjacent carbon (C6).\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, specifically 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3, Palladium on carbon (Pd/C), and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has three effects on Product 3:\n    1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  The benzyl ether is cleaved through hydrogenolysis, converting the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OCH₂Ph) back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The resulting structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This compound is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our derived structure for Product 4 with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect.

The substituents (-CH2OH and the isopropenyl group) are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    *   NaH reacts with the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr, Ph-CH2-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   The alkoxide displaces the bromide ion, forming a benzyl ether (-CH2-O-CH2-Ph, abbreviated as -CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts specifically with aldehydes and ketones under acidic catalysis.\n    *   The nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated to form a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). The other functional groups (benzyl ether and alkene) are unaffected.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction.\n    *   n-Butyllithium is a very strong base. It is used in excess (typically 2 equivalents). The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon α (adjacent) to the original carbonyl carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   This dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyl anion.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride is a mild proton source that quenches the vinyl anion, protonating it.\n    *   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond, located between the original carbonyl carbon and the α-carbon that was deprotonated. The reaction typically forms the less substituted alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** A new double bond is formed in the ring, for example, between C1 and C6. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are still in a 1,3-relationship. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C with H₂ is a powerful reducing system that can reduce several functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced.\n        1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated to a single bond, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n        2.  The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is hydrogenated to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction). The C-O bond between the benzyl group's CH₂ and the oxygen is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol.\n        R-O-CH₂-Ph + H₂ → R-OH + CH₃-Ph (toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their original 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Final Structure Identification:**\nThe final product, Product 4, is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.

The tosylhydrazide group was eliminated in Step 3.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under these conditions.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure would result from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the course of a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   It has a ketone group at position 1 (C1=O).\n    *   It has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 (-CH2OH).\n    *   It has an isopropenyl group at position 5 (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ~16-18) than the alpha-protons to the ketone (pKa ~19-20).\n    *   NaH reacts with the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   The alkoxide is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2Ph, abbreviated as -CH2OBn). The rest of the molecule is unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction (loss of H2O), catalyzed by acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one tosylhydrazone.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   n-BuLi is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon alpha to the original ketone (C2 or C6).\n    *   Deprotonation will occur at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, which is C6 (C2 is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    *   The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between C1 and C6.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride workup protonates the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the replacement of the ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with the double bond between the original C1 and C6 carbons. The ring still carries the benzyloxymethyl group and the isopropenyl group. A possible IUPAC name is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is used to reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and also to cleave benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn) is cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken by hydrogen, regenerating the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and forming toluene (PhCH3) as a byproduct. The use of a benzyl group as a protecting group for an alcohol relies on its easy removal by this method.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative positions of these two substituents are the same as in the starting material (on C3 and C5), which is a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** This molecule is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure for Product 4 with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. While possible under very mild or specific conditions, standard H2/Pd-C hydrogenation typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure results from an incorrect reaction sequence, ignoring the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway, assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on a ketone.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches the expected final product after all four reaction steps, including the reduction of all double bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether protecting group.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe reaction sequence described involves four distinct synthetic steps. A careful analysis of each step leads to the structure of the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the alcohol.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a classic Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming product 1, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of a tosylhydrazone.** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of acid. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, product 2. This is a standard preparatory step for the Shapiro reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction.** The tosylhydrazone (product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This reaction, known as the Shapiro reaction, converts the ketone into an alkene by first forming a dianion, which then eliminates nitrogen gas and the tosyl group to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. This intermediate is then quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride to yield a protonated alkene, product 3. The original ketone at position C1 is thus removed and replaced with a double bond. The resulting product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reduction method affects multiple parts of the molecule:\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, saturating the ring.\n    *   The double bond of the isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is also reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    *   Crucially, the benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved via hydrogenolysis to regenerate the alcohol. This reaction splits the benzyl ether back into a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and toluene. It's a standard method for deprotecting benzyl ethers.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product, product 4, is a cyclohexane ring where the ketone has been removed, the isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyl ether has reverted to a primary alcohol. This results in (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis of the reaction sequence, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe step-by-step chemical transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. The product of this step, Product 1, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation.** Product 1, a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a condensation reaction that converts the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) into a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). Product 2 is the corresponding tosylhydrazone.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction.** The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) undergoes a Shapiro reaction upon treatment with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone group and forms a carbon-carbon double bond where the original carbonyl group was located. A subsequent quench with aqueous ammonium chloride provides a proton to form the final alkene. The product, Product 3, is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.** Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This versatile reagent performs two transformations here:\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** The two carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved. The bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, and the resulting groups are capped with hydrogen. This converts the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). It is a standard method for deprotecting benzyl ethers, although it can sometimes be inhibited by certain additives.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct structure for product 4 is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n\nThis is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol group (-OH) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n\nThe ketone group of Product 1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (often called a tosylhydrazone). The acid catalyst facilitates this condensation reaction.\n\n*   **Product 2:** 4-methyl-N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)benzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n\nThis is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which converts the ketone into an alkene. The base removes two protons, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride then quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene. The result is the removal of the original ketone and formation of a C=C double bond in its place.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n\nThis is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C and H₂ will reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds. Product 3 has two such bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl group. Both will be reduced to single bonds, converting the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which reduces them back to alcohols.\n\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  Reduction of the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  Reduction of the cyclohexene C=C bond to a C-C single bond.\n    3.  Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies a different reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches the product expected from the complete reduction and hydrogenolysis of Product 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This is a cyclohexanone molecule with three key functional groups: a ketone (C=O) at position 1, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5. The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH) is the most acidic site (pKa ~16-18), more so than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). This forms a sodium alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis (an S_N2 reaction). The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   This reaction selectively protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether (-O-CH2-Ph). The ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is the standard procedure for forming a tosylhydrazone from a ketone.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide to form a C=N bond, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the ketone for this condensation reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1. The structure at C1 is now C=N-NHTs.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n    *   This set of reagents and conditions corresponds to the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone back into an alkene, effectively removing the original oxygen atom from the ketone.\n    *   n-Butyllithium, a very strong base, deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice. The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating the stable p-toluenesulfinate anion and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the vinyllithium by protonating it.\n    *   The net result is the transformation of the ketone functional group into a carbon-carbon double bond. The C=O group at C1 is replaced by a C=C bond.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative. The ring now contains a double bond where the ketone was. The molecule retains the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. An example structure would be 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The crucial point is that the 1,3-relationship of the substituent attachment points on the ring's carbon framework is preserved.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Stirring Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** All C=C double bonds in the molecule will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n        1.  The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, making the ring a saturated **cyclohexane**.\n        2.  The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced, forming an **isopropyl group** (-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved under these conditions. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2-O-CH2-Ph) is converted back into a **hydroxymethyl group** (-CH2OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Since the 1,3-relationship between the substituents was maintained throughout the synthesis, they are in a 1,3-arrangement on the final cyclohexane ring. This structure is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare this derived structure with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a tosylhydrazone, an intermediate.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies nucleophilic addition of BuLi and retention of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which is cleaved in the final step.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one + NaH, then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (PhCH2Br):** An alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first part is a good nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn or -OCH₂Ph). This is a common method for protecting an alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also called tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction converts a ketone (or aldehyde) into a tosylhydrazone. The lone pair on the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aq. NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl):** A mild acid used for workup to protonate any anionic species.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**. The dianion formed by the action of n-BuLi undergoes spontaneous elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. This vinyllithium is then quenched (protonated) by the aqueous workup.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone functional group is replaced by a C=C double bond, effectively removing the original ketone oxygen and converting the C-N bond to a C-C pi bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position. The overall result is the conversion of a ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain untouched. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H₂**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in the molecule (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is also highly effective at cleaving benzyl ethers (a process called hydrogenolysis). The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) will be cleaved back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), releasing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Renaming this final molecule according to IUPAC rules, it is a substituted methanol. The main chain is methanol, and the substituent is a (3-isopropylcyclohexyl) group.\n*   **Final Structure:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Incorrect.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure still contains the tosylhydrazide group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol** - This structure correctly reflects the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. **This is the correct answer.**\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This suggests a nucleophilic attack of butyllithium on the ketone, which does not happen in a Shapiro reaction. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's analyze each reaction step by step to determine the final structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This process protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1 Structure:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =NNHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The ketone (C=O) is converted to C=NNHTs.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** These are the conditions for a **Shapiro reaction**. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice to form a dianion. This unstable intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a sulfinate salt to generate a vinyllithium species. This reaction effectively replaces the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The quench with aqueous NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium to give the alkene product.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** A cyclohexene ring containing the (benzyloxy)methyl and isopropenyl substituents. For example, **4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated, and the double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C reagent combination is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (deprotection). The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn) is reduced back to the original hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4 Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyl ether has been cleaved to reveal the original hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This structure matches the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This assumes an incorrect reaction pathway for n-BuLi and fails to account for the deprotection in the final step.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the intermediate before the final hydrogenolysis step; the benzyl protecting group is still present.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three main functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group). It also has acidic α-protons adjacent to the ketone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Thus, NaH selectively deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n        R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr, PhCH₂Br):** The sodium alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n        R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph (a benzyl ether) + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged. The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide). This reagent reacts with aldehydes and ketones in a condensation reaction to form a tosylhydrazone. The acid catalyst (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, activating it for nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the hydrazide, followed by dehydration.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The structure of Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. Typically, two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl):** This is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively replaces a carbonyl group (via its tosylhydrazone derivative) with a C-H bond and a C=C double bond. The ketone is deoxygenated to an alkene. The double bond can form between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6. Regardless of the exact position, the result is a cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a double bond originating from C1. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unchanged. The structure of Product 3 is a **cyclohexene derivative with a (benzyloxy)methyl substituent and a (prop-1-en-2-yl) substituent**. For example, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation.\n*   **Reactions:** This reaction will cause three transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkene in the ring:** The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Reduction of Alkene in the side chain:** The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the original alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ --(Pd/C)--> R-CH₂OH + CH₃Ph\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group. Based on the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring (they were at positions 3 and 5 on the original cyclohexanone ring).\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is an alcohol. The parent name is methanol. The substituent is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group. Numbering the ring from the point of attachment to the methanol group (C1), the isopropyl group is at C3. Therefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing this derived structure name with the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved in the final step.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure results from several incorrect reaction pathways.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is not the product of the full reaction sequence.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group do not react under these conditions. Product 1 is therefore 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged. Product 2 is the corresponding tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, a tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) are used to deprotonate first the N-H group and then the less-substituted α-carbon. This is followed by the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous ammonium chloride, yielding an alkene. The original ketone at C1 is thus replaced by a double bond, typically positioned at the less substituted side, between C1 and C6. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group are not affected. Product 3 is therefore (((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n    Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated (reduced to single bonds), converting the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. Simultaneously, the benzyl ether (O-Bn) is cleaved back to a primary alcohol (-OH). Therefore, the final product, Product 4, is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this four-step synthesis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe analysis of the reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, which is an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, to form a benzyl ether. The product of this step, Product 1, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The resulting Product 2 is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a strong base. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, two equivalents of the strong base deprotonate the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas, forming an alkene. The reaction typically forms the less substituted (kinetic) alkene. This reaction converts the ketone, via its tosylhydrazone, into a carbon-carbon double bond. The aqueous ammonium chloride is used for workup. Product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This process will reduce the two alkene double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) to single bonds. Simultaneously, Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols. Therefore, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the benzyl ether is cleaved to regenerate the primary alcohol.\n\nThe final structure, Product 4, is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which in this case is the hydroxyl proton of the alcohol, forming a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming Product 1: **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a condensation reaction where the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.\n    *   This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi), which converts the ketone into an alkene. The first equivalent of base deprotonates the hydrazone nitrogen, and the second deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon. This intermediate then eliminates nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium species.\n    *   The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n    *   Product 3 is **(((5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   The isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, resulting in a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Crucially, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard and efficient method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a reaction called hydrogenolysis), regenerating the alcohol. This deprotection often occurs under the same mild conditions used for alkene hydrogenation.\n    *   Therefore, both C=C double bonds are reduced, and the benzyl ether is cleaved to yield an alcohol.\n    *   The final structure, Product 4, is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches the derived structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction does not add the butyl group to the ring.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This fails to account for the Shapiro reaction and subsequent hydrogenation of the tosylhydrazone.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if only the alkenes were reduced, but not the benzyl ether. Standard hydrogenation conditions typically cleave benzyl ethers.\n\nThus, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nLet's first draw the structure. It's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 1 is the ketone (=O). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is more commonly known as an isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2].\n\n```\n      O\n      //\n     C\n   /   \\\nH2C     CH -- CH2OH\n |       |\nHC -- CH2\n |\nC(=CH2)CH3\n```\nThe molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Reagent 1: Sodium hydride (NaH)**. NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is much more acidic than the alpha-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Thus, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl bromide (BnBr)**. This is an electrophile. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first step attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis).\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\nThis reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn), effectively protecting the alcohol. The ketone and alkene do not react under these conditions.\n**Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic HCl**\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 is a ketone, and it is treated with a hydrazine derivative (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide) under acidic conditions.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic condensation reaction to form a hydrazone. The ketone reacts with the hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (or tosylhydrazone for short), with the elimination of a water molecule.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\n**Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of product 1. The C=O group at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents acting on a tosylhydrazone signifies a Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. It's a deoxygenation reaction. Two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- group. The second deprotonates the carbon alpha to the C=N bond. This intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium species.\n*   **Workup:** The aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild acid) quenches the vinyllithium intermediate by protonating it.\nThe overall transformation is the replacement of the original C=O group with a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered alpha position (kinetic control). In this case, it will form between the original C1 and C2, or C1 and C6. Regardless of the exact position, the product is a cyclohexene derivative.\n**Product 3** is a cyclohexene substituted with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship on the ring framework. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C and H₂ are the standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This powerful reducing system will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene reduction:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon breaks.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂OBn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH] (plus toluene as a byproduct).\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached. These two substituents retain the 1,3-relationship they had in the starting material.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is 1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane. This can also be named as **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: This name describes our final product perfectly.\nB) **(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H₂ readily cleaves benzyl ethers.\nC) **N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**: This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction in step 3, which eliminates the tosylhydrazone group.\nD) **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction. It suggests n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the main pathway for tosylhydrazones.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reaction sequence, Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, then benzyl bromide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material has a ketone, an alcohol (hydroxymethyl), and an alkene (isopropenyl) functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, forming a benzyl ether.

It reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. Water is eliminated in the process.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous NH₄Cl**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 is a tosylhydrazone. It is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone of a ketone is converted to an alkene. Treatment with two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi deprotonates the hydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas and the formation of a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate, protonating it to form the final alkene product. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is the kinetic product.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is effectively replaced by a double bond. The double bond forms between C1 and C6 of the cyclohexene ring. The other groups are unaffected. The resulting structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 contains two carbon-carbon double bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether. It is treated with hydrogen gas over a palladium-on-carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds.

It has three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic than any C-H proton, including those alpha to the ketone.\n    *   NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) to form an alkoxide (-CH2O-).\n    *   This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis).

The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base (n-BuLi).\n    *   n-BuLi deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to a dianion. This dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N2) and a tosyl anion to form a vinyllithium intermediate where the ketone used to be.\n    *   The vinyllithium is quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH4Cl) to form an alkene. The net result is the replacement of the original C=O group with a C=C double bond within the ring.\n    *   Product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or another isomer depending on which alpha-proton is removed, but the exact position is not critical for the final step).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H2 -> Product 4**\n    *   This is catalytic hydrogenation. Pd/C with H2 is a powerful reducing agent for several functional groups.\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds:\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n        *   The cyclohexene double bond is reduced, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n    *   It also performs hydrogenolysis on benzyl ethers:\n        *   The benzyloxy group (-O-CH2-Ph) is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol (-OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n    *   Putting it all together: The final molecule, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group. The relative 1,3-substitution pattern from the start is maintained. The chemical name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n5.  **Matching with options:**\n    *   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile, in the Shapiro reaction.\n    *   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n    *   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect.

It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material. The alcohol's proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ~ 16-18) than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ~ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br):** The alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reaction:** R-OH + NaH → R-O⁻Na⁺ + H₂; then R-O⁻Na⁺ + BnBr → R-O-Bn + NaBr.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The nucleophilic nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This is an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Reaction:** R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at position 1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NH-Ts). The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence of reagents applied to a tosylhydrazone is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **n-BuLi:** Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). Deprotonation occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the C6 position is less hindered than the C2 position (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    2.  **Collapse:** The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the stable p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), forming a vinyl lithium species. The new C=C double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n    3.  **Aqueous NH4Cl:** This is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyl lithium intermediate.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group has been completely removed and replaced with a C=C double bond between positions 1 and 6.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing C=C double bonds and for the hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n*   **Reactions occurring:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The C=C bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is hydrogenated, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-O-CH₂Ph) is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen breaks, regenerating the alcohol and forming toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   C(ring)-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + H₂ → C(ring)-CH₂-OH + Ph-CH₃ (Toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** The molecule is now a fully saturated cyclohexane ring. It has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). These substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n*   **Name of Product 4:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The parent structure is cyclohexylmethanol. There is an isopropyl group at the 3-position relative to the hydroxymethyl group. Thus, the name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy following the reaction sequence, the final product is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. This structure corresponds to **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This product results if the benzyl ether is not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This product did not undergo the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the pathway for a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.** This matches the structure derived from the full reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze the structure. It's a six-membered ring containing a ketone at position 1 (C1=O). At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The substituents at positions 3 and 5 are in a 1,3-relationship relative to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the starting material. The hydroxyl proton (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 17) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20).\n    *   NaH removes the proton from the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O- Na+).\n    *   This alkoxide is a good nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr), displacing the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n    *   The -OH group is thus protected as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   The ketone functional group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.\n    *   The reaction is an acid-catalyzed condensation, eliminating a molecule of water to form a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. The structure is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction.\n    *   The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a very strong base, n-BuLi.\n    *   The base sequentially removes two protons: first from the NH group and then from the carbon atom α to the C=N bond (i.e., from C2 or C6 of the ring). Deprotonation at C6 is generally favored to avoid steric hindrance from the substituent at C3.\n    *   This leads to the elimination of the toluenesulfinate anion (Ts-) and a molecule of nitrogen gas (N2), generating a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The final step is quenching this intermediate with a proton source (water from the aqueous NH4Cl workup).\n    *   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively reducing the ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The molecule now contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   H2 with Pd/C is a standard and potent combination for reducing several functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n        1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n        2.  The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is hydrogenated, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved, and the benzyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. The -CH2OBn group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   **Putting it all together for Product 4:**\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring has been converted to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The substituent at C3, -CH2OH, which was protected and then deprotected, is restored.\n    *   The substituent at C5, the isopropenyl group, is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents are in a 1,3-relationship, as they were on carbons 3 and 5 of the original ring.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** The IUPAC name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet's match this final structure with the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether were not cleaved.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This name accurately describes the final product derived from the reaction sequence.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is a complex hydrazide structure inconsistent with the reactions.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not the case in a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe reaction sequence described involves four distinct steps in organic synthesis. A detailed analysis of each step leads to the final structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, contains a primary alcohol functional group (-CH₂OH). Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, a classic Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\nProduct 1, a ketone, is treated with *p*-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a standard condensation reaction where the ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazide to form a *p*-toluenesulfonylhydrazone, also known as a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of *n*-butyllithium (*n*-BuLi), a strong base. This initiates a Shapiro reaction. The base first deprotonates the hydrazone nitrogen and then a carbon atom alpha (adjacent) to the C=N double bond. This leads to the elimination of the tosyl group and dinitrogen gas (N₂), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is regioselective, with deprotonation typically occurring at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon. In this case, the double bond forms between C1 and C6 of the ring. Subsequent quenching with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing condition has three effects on the molecule:\n1.  The carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n2.  The carbon-carbon double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n3.  The benzyl ether is cleaved via hydrogenolysis to form an alcohol and toluene (which is removed during workup). While some conditions can selectively hydrogenate alkenes without cleaving benzyl ethers, standard H₂ with Pd/C is known to efficiently perform both reductions.\n\nCombining these transformations, the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\nProduct 1, which contains a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a standard reaction to convert a ketone into a tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), at low temperature, followed by a proton source (aqueous ammonium chloride). This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The reaction converts the tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the tosylhydrazone group and forming a double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted α-carbon, which in this case would be between C1 and C6. The aqueous ammonium chloride then quenches the reaction, protonating the intermediate vinyllithium species.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing condition affects multiple functional groups:\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group are reduced to single bonds.\n*   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, converting the ether back into an alcohol (-OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct. This is a standard deprotection method, although it can sometimes be inhibited by certain additives.\n\nThe final transformations are:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n*   The (benzyloxy)methyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the options provided:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect, this is the product before the final deprotection step.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol and a ketone. It is treated first with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl group proton is significantly more acidic than any α-protons of the ketone, so NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The alkoxide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide and displacing the bromide ion to form a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1, a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group condenses with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide to form a C=N double bond, eliminating a molecule of water.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is subjected to the conditions of a Shapiro reaction. It is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), at low temperature. The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H group of the hydrazone, and the second equivalent removes a proton from the carbon atom alpha to the C=N bond. The resulting intermediate eliminates diimide (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium species. This vinyllithium is then protonated during the aqueous ammonium chloride workup to yield an alkene. The regioselectivity of the Shapiro reaction typically favors the formation of the less substituted, kinetic alkene product. In this case, the double bond forms between C1 and the less substituted C6 position.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). These are standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction will reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleave the benzyl ether through hydrogenolysis. Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated to form single bonds. Simultaneously, the benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) will be cleaved to regenerate the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   The benzyl ether is cleaved back to a primary alcohol.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the four consecutive reactions, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Comparing this structure to the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **This matches the derived structure.**\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction is an elimination, not an addition of the butyl group, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone moiety.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the intermediate before the final hydrogenolysis step that cleaves the benzyl ether.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and then BnBr**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an electrophilic alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first part will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The alcohol group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn). The ketone and the isopropenyl group do not react.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and HCl**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazine).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. Under acidic catalysis (HCl), the ketone carbonyl group condenses with the primary amine of tosylhydrazide to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The other functional groups (benzyl ether, alkene) are unchanged.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **The p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base.\n    *   Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a mild proton source for quenching the reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates both the N-H proton of the hydrazone and an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The cyclohexanone ring has α-protons at C2 and C6. Deprotonation at the less sterically hindered position (C6) is kinetically favored. Abstraction of the C6 proton leads to an intermediate that eliminates dinitrogen gas (N2) and the tosylsulfinate anion to form a vinyllithium species.\n*   **Workup:** Quenching with aqueous NH4Cl protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The C=O group of the original ketone is replaced with a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted α-carbon (C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative with the double bond between C1 and C6. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are retained.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (The relative positions of the substituents are 1,3 on the ring, which corresponds to positions C3 and C5 on the original ketone).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, which contains three reducible groups: two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl group) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** H2 (hydrogen gas) and Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The Pd/C catalyst with H2 will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** These conditions are also standard for the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and the ether is converted back to an alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n*   **Product 4:** All reducible groups are transformed.\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is now saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 (original numbering) is now an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group at C3 (original numbering) is now a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   **Final Structure and Name:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at a 1,3-relative position. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol has priority. The carbon bearing the -CH2OH group is part of the \"methanol\" parent name, and the ring is the substituent. The ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (C1) such that the isopropyl group gets the lowest possible locant (C3).\n    *   Name of Product 4: **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**\n\n**Comparing with the Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. No butyl addition occurs, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone moiety would have been removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product obtained after the four-step sequence.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the structure if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is highly unlikely under H2/Pd/C conditions.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's first visualize the starting molecule. It is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a ketone group at position 1 (`-one`), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH), followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Sodium Hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr, PhCH2Br)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis). This displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn or -OCH2Ph). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n*   This is a classic reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone functional group at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.\n*   The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under acidic catalysis.\n*   **Product 2:** A tosylhydrazone is formed. The C=O group of the ketone is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group. The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of Product 1**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   This set of reagents applied to a tosylhydrazone constitutes a **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. It will abstract two acidic protons in succession: first the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone, and then a proton from the carbon atom α to the C=N bond (the former C6 or C2 of the ring).\n*   This results in a dianion, which then undergoes spontaneous elimination of nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The original C1 carbon (from the ketone) is now part of a C=C double bond and bears the lithium atom.\n*   **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)** is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium to give a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of the ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The oxygen atom is removed, and a double bond is formed adjacent to the original carbonyl position. The structure is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions.\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is hydrogenated to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A key reaction catalyzed by Pd/C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken by hydrogen (hydrogenolysis).\n    *   The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH3), which is removed during workup.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group (from the original isopropenyl group at C5) and a hydroxymethyl group (from the original benzylated hydroxymethyl group at C3). The relative positions of these two groups are 1,3 on the cyclohexane ring. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if only hydrogenation of the double bonds occurred, without the cleavage of the benzyl ether. This is an incomplete reaction.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure incorrectly retains the tosylhydrazide moiety, which is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure would arise if n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the described reaction pathway.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches the outcome of the complete, four-step reaction sequence as described.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the multi-step synthesis to identify the structure of Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Starting Material with NaH and Benzyl Bromide**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Process**:\n    1.  NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the hydroxymethyl substituent. This forms a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction).\n    3.  This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OCH₂Ph). This step serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from reacting in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1**: The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Process**: This is a classic reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone at position 1 condenses with the tosylhydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**.\n*   **Product 2**: The tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1, where the C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone) is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n*   **Process**: This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene.\n    1.  The strong base (n-BuLi) removes two protons, leading to an intermediate that collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion.\n    2.  This forms a vinyllithium species. The double bond forms regioselectively at the less sterically hindered position, which is between C1 and C6.\n    3.  The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Product 3**: The ketone/tosylhydrazone functionality is replaced by a double bond. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Process**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a powerful reduction method that affects multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation**: Both C=C double bonds in the molecule are reduced (saturated) to C-C single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, and the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether**: H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, and the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OCH₂Ph) is converted back to the original hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4**: The final molecule is a saturated cyclohexane ring with two substituents in a 1,3-relationship: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

An alkene (the isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position C5.\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is much more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n    *   **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** This is an alkylating agent.\n    *   **The Reaction:** The resulting alkoxide ion is a potent nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The ketone and the alkene functionalities do not react under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxyl group has been converted to a benzyl ether (-O-CH2-Ph, abbreviated as -OBn).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl.\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a derivative of hydrazine.\n    *   **The Reaction:** Aldehydes and ketones react with hydrazines under acidic catalysis in a condensation reaction to form hydrazones. The ketone group (C=O) of Product 1 reacts with the tosylhydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs). A molecule of water is eliminated in the process.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1.

In the first step, it is treated with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, which deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.

This initiates a Shapiro reaction. The strong base removes two protons, leading to the elimination of the p-toluenesulfinate anion and nitrogen gas (N₂), which forms a vinyllithium species. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate by providing a proton source, resulting in the formation of an alkene where the ketone used to be. The reaction typically forms the less substituted (kinetic) alkene product.\n    *   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n    Product 3, which contains two alkene groups (one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether, is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation over Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with a hydrogen atmosphere. This powerful reducing system will:\n    1.  Reduce the alkene in the cyclohexene ring to an alkane (cyclohexane).\n    2.  Reduce the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    3.

It has an alcohol and a ketone functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of acid.

This initiates a Shapiro reaction. In the Shapiro reaction, two equivalents of the strong base convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, with the loss of nitrogen gas and the tosyl group. The ketone is effectively replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium intermediate to form the final alkene.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers (hydrogenolysis).\n*   The isopropenyl double bond is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   The cyclohexene double bond is reduced to saturate the ring, forming a cyclohexane.\n*   The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the primary alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n\nTherefore, the final product has a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group as substituents.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is C.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group, which is the most acidic proton in the starting material. The resulting alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The product is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by =N-NHTs.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone derivative, **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 with n-butyllithium, then aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium. This process eliminates the entire tosylhydrazone group and replaces it with a carbon-carbon double bond. The deprotonation occurs preferentially at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is C-6 in this case. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, a proton source, to yield the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C-1 is removed, and a double bond is formed between C-1 and C-6. The product is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a standard catalyst for this process.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is also a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers to yield an alcohol and toluene. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) will be reduced to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). While certain conditions or additives can prevent this cleavage, standard hydrogenation conditions typically cause it.\n*   **Product 4:** The combination of these transformations results in a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in step 3.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway for the Shapiro reaction and fails to account for the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the product derived from the full reaction sequence.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only hydrogenation occurred without the cleavage of the benzyl ether, which is unlikely under these conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first draw the structure of the starting material.\n*   `cyclohexan-1-one`: A six-membered ring containing a ketone (C=O) group at position 1.\n*   `3-(hydroxymethyl)`: A -CH₂OH group attached to carbon 3.\n*   `5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)`: An isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] attached to carbon 5.\nThe positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other with respect to C1.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /    \\\nC6    C3--CH₂OH\n|      |\nC5-----C4\n|\nC(CH₃)=CH₂\n```\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide.\n    R-CH₂-OH + NaH → R-CH₂-O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **BnBr (benzyl bromide, PhCH₂Br):** The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH₂-O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl double bond are unaffected.\n    Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-BuLi:** Two equivalents of this strong base are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   **aq. NH₄Cl:** The vinyllithium intermediate is quenched with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, to give an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the conversion of the ketone into an alkene. Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative, containing a double bond where the ketone was. It still has the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. The relative 1,3-disposition of the substituents is preserved.\n    An example structure for Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several transformations.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, deprotecting the alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-Bn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their original 1,3- (or meta-) relationship on the ring.\n*   The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl group would be removed by hydrogenolysis, and the butyl group from BuLi is not added in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by Pd/C and H₂.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated during the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both double bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether in Product 3.\n\nThe final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe four-step reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n**Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr). NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl groups remain unchanged. Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). This reaction converts the ketone into a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (tosylhydrazone) through a condensation reaction, where a molecule of water is eliminated. Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This is a Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used to convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, with the loss of nitrogen gas and toluenesulfinate. The subsequent aqueous workup protonates the vinyllithium species to form an alkene. This reaction effectively removes the ketone functionality and replaces it with a carbon-carbon double bond. Product 3 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The catalyst Pd/C with H₂ gas reduces carbon-carbon double bonds. In Product 3, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated (reduced) to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols. Therefore, the benzyl ether group is cleaved to a hydroxymethyl group.\n\nThe final product, product 4, is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, specifically **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect, the tosylhydrazone group is removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct, this matches the deduced structure of Product 4.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect, this would result from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile on the ketone, not a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect, this is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This is a cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at C1, a hydroxymethyl (-CH₂OH) group at C3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at C5.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Mechanism:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a sodium alkoxide (-O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction).\n    *   **Product 1:** The -CH₂OH group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn, where Bn is benzyl, -CH₂Ph). The rest of the molecule is unchanged. Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (the ketone from the previous step).\n    *   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The ketone functional group reacts with tosylhydrazide under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is replaced by =N-NHTs.\n    *   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n    *   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- group of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates a proton on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond. This leads to an unstable intermediate that eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, forming a vinyllithium species. The subsequent addition of aqueous NH₄Cl (a mild proton source) quenches this intermediate, protonating the vinyllithium to form an alkene. The C=O group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position.\n    *   **Product 3:** An alkene where the cyclohexanone ring has become a cyclohexene ring. The other groups (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are unchanged. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 4:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (the di-alkene with a benzyl ether).\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has three effects on Product 3:\n        1.  It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring.\n        2.  It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond of the isopropenyl group, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n        3.  It cleaves the benzyl ether via hydrogenolysis, converting the benzyloxymethyl group back into a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Structure:**\n    *   The final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n    *   Let's compare this with the given options:\n        *   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl ether would be cleaved, and n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile.\n        *   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final structure.\n        *   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This structure implies the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is unlikely with H₂/Pd-C.\n        *   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect.

It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is much more acidic than the ketone's α-protons (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    *   NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the most acidic proton for the reaction with NaH. The alcohol is more acidic than the α-carbon of the ketone.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the alkene group are unaffected.\n    *   Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the hydrazine derivative in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water to form a C=N bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction specifically targets the ketone/aldehyde functional group and is the preparatory step for elimination reactions like the Shapiro or Bamford-Stevens reactions.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction.\n    *   n-Butyllithium is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-proton (on the carbon adjacent to the C=N group).\n    *   The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as a sulfinate salt). This forms a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the reaction by protonating the vinyllithium species.\n    *   The overall result is the deoxygenation of the ketone to an alkene. The carbonyl group at position 1 is replaced by a double bond between C1 and one of the adjacent carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Careful Point:** Recognize that n-BuLi functions as a base, not a nucleophile, in this context. The Shapiro reaction is a key method for converting ketones into alkenes. The regiochemistry of the double bond formation is not crucial here because the next step saturates the entire ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative where the original ketone is gone, replaced by a C=C bond. The molecule now contains a benzyl ether, an isopropenyl group, and a double bond within the six-membered ring.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a powerful reduction method. It will affect multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, making the ring a saturated cyclohexane.\n    2.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** The C=C double bond of the isopropenyl group will also be reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a form of deprotection). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common oversight is forgetting that H₂/Pd-C can do more than just reduce C=C bonds. The cleavage of benzyl ethers (hydrogenolysis) is a critical transformation in this step.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring. The substituent that was originally the isopropenyl group is now an isopropyl group. The substituent that was the protected hydroxymethyl group is now back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The relative 1,3-positions of these two substituents on the ring are preserved. The structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, with the given options.\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved.

Benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (pKa ~16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an S_N2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and cat. HCl**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a hydrazine derivative. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazine derivatives under acidic conditions to form hydrazones. The ketone at C1 condenses with TsNHNH₂ to form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide. The ketone C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-BuLi, then aqueous NH₄Cl**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Aqueous ammonium chloride is for workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base.\n    1.  The first n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton.\n    2.  The second n-BuLi deprotonates a proton on a carbon α to the hydrazone (either C2 or C6).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and p-toluenesulfinate anion to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between C1 and the deprotonated α-carbon (e.g., C1=C2).\n    4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Net Result:** The ketone is converted into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The double bond is at the position of the original ketone. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with H₂, Pd/C**\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) with a Palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which has two major effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Pd/C is an excellent catalyst for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers (O-Bn bond). This is called hydrogenolysis. The benzyloxy group is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   -CH₂-O-Bn → -CH₂-OH\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane skeleton. The isopropenyl group at C5 is now an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group at C3 is now a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3 relationship.\n\n**Determining the Final Structure and Name**\nThe final molecule is 3-isopropyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane (the numbering reflects the original scheme). A more systematic name, assigning C1 to the carbon bearing the substituent, would be (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure retains the tosylhydrazone, meaning the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation haven't fully occurred.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if only hydrogenation of the alkenes occurred, but not the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. With Pd/C, hydrogenolysis is expected.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies the addition of a butyl group, which doesn't happen in this reaction sequence.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name describes a methanol molecule substituted with a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group, which is equivalent to a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl (-CH₂OH) group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe multi-step synthesis transforms 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one into (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Product 1 Formation**\n    The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether, forming 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (Product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 2 Formation**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic acid. The ketone group of Product 1 reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction yields N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide (Product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 3 Formation**\n    Product 2 undergoes a Shapiro reaction upon treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature. In this reaction, two equivalents of the strong base are used to convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, which eliminates nitrogen gas. The reaction regioselectivity is controlled by the deprotonation of the carbon alpha to the hydrazone, with the base typically removing the less sterically hindered proton. In this case, the proton at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species to yield an alkene. This step effectively removes the original ketone functional group and forms a double bond, resulting in 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (Product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 4 Formation**\n    Product 3 is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This final step involves catalytic hydrogenation. The conditions are sufficient to reduce both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group—to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene into a cyclohexane ring. Concurrently, Pd/C catalysis with H2 is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which removes the benzyl protecting group and regenerates the alcohol. The final product is therefore (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol (Product 4).\n\nThe relative 1,3-relationship between the hydroxymethyl and isopropenyl/isopropyl substituents is maintained throughout the entire sequence.\n\nThus, the final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. It is first treated with sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base. The NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr). The alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which forms a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl). The ketone functional group of the cyclohexanone ring reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms from the amino group of the hydrazide are eliminated as water.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at a low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench. These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The n-BuLi, a strong base, deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene product. The original carbonyl group is effectively removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring at that position.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This process reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers through hydrogenolysis.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n*   The benzyl ether is cleaved, converting the benzyloxymethyl group back to a hydroxymethyl group.\n\nCombining these transformations, the final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group at position 5 and a hydroxymethyl group at position 3.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches the derived structure.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation products.\nD) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure implies the Shapiro reaction did not occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThe user has presented a multi-step synthesis problem and asked for the structure of the final product. I will analyze each step of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the intermediates and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has a primary alcohol and a ketone. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\nProduct 1 is a ketone, which reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). This is a condensation reaction that forms a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (tosylhydrazone).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\nThe tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This initiates a Shapiro reaction, where the ketone is converted into an alkene. The reaction involves deprotonation of the hydrazone and an α-carbon, followed by elimination of the tosyl group and nitrogen gas to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup with ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium species, yielding an alkene where the ketone was originally located.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\nProduct 3 has two carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl group) and a benzyl ether. It is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This versatile reagent will reduce both C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds. Specifically, the isopropenyl group will be reduced to an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene ring will become a cyclohexane ring. Concurrently, Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for the cleavage (hydrogenolysis) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols.\n\n*   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) is cleaved back to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first draw the structure of the starting material.\n*   It has a cyclohexanone backbone (a six-membered ring with a ketone group).\n*   The ketone carbonyl group is at position C1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is at position C3.\n*   A prop-1-en-2-yl group (commonly known as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) is at position C5.\n\nThe structure has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + Ph-CH2Br → R-CH2-O-CH2Ph + NaBr\n\nThis step effectively protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreactive under these conditions.\n\n**Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The nucleophilic amino group (-NH2) of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. Subsequent dehydration (loss of H2O), catalyzed by acid (HCl), yields the tosylhydrazone.\n    R₂C=O + H₂NNHTs → R₂C=NNHTs + H₂O\n\nThe ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n\n**Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexanone.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone to an alkene. It requires at least two equivalents of a strong base, like n-butyllithium.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (a proton on C2 or C6).\n    3.  This intermediate collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium species.\n    4.  The reaction is then quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl) to protonate the vinyllithium, forming the final alkene product.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond, effectively a deoxygenation reaction. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the adjacent carbon that was deprotonated (C2 or C6).\n\n**Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative. Specifically, a molecule with a cyclohexene ring, a benzyloxymethyl substituent, and an isopropenyl substituent. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful reducing system that affects several functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated) to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Benzyl ethers are readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and a hydrogen atom is added to each fragment.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH] + Toluene [CH₃Ph].\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3- (or meta) relationship between these two groups, established in the starting material, is maintained throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This structure results if the benzyl ether is not cleaved.

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ~16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an S_N2 reaction (Williamson Ether Synthesis). This protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone.\n*   **Reaction:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones and aldehydes under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents defines the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). This leads to the formation of a dianion, which then eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl anion to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene. This reaction effectively replaces the original ketone with a double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation using H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method that will cause two transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds. The cyclohexene ring will become a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] will become an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is the classic reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The molecule is fully saturated, and the alcohol is deprotected.

It will deprotonate the most acidic functional group, which is the alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 17) over the ketone's alpha-protons (pKa ≈ 20). This forms a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (S_N2 reaction).\n    *   **Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol has been protected as a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂).**\n    *   This is the standard reaction for forming a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The nucleophilic -NH₂ group of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n    *   **Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).**\n    *   This reaction is a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base and deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice (once on the NH group, and once on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond).\n    *   The resulting unstable dianion eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   Subsequent quenching with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone C=O group with a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product 3** is a cyclohexene derivative, specifically 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C and H₂.**\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon is a powerful catalyst that will reduce several groups in Product 3.\n    1.  The alkene within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to an alkane, saturating the ring.\n    2.  The alkene of the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an alkane, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  The benzyl ether protecting group is removed via hydrogenolysis. The benzylic C-O bond is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol and forming toluene as a byproduct.\n    *   The final structure has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The substituents, an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, are in a 1,3-relationship, preserved from the starting material.\n    *   **Product 4** is therefore **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Comparing the final structure with the given options, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol perfectly matches option A.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the hydroxyl proton of the alcohol. This forms a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction known as the Williamson ether synthesis. This results in the formation of a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid. The ketone functional group condenses with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This reaction is a standard method for derivatizing ketones and aldehydes.\n\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2, the tosylhydrazone, is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This initiates the Shapiro reaction. The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the nitrogen of the hydrazone, and the second equivalent deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The resulting intermediate eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. This intermediate is then protonated during the aqueous ammonium chloride workup to yield an alkene. The double bond forms where the ketone was, specifically regioselectively at the less sterically hindered position.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This versatile reagent reduces multiple functional groups.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The double bond of the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   Crucially, Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation also cleaves benzyl ethers (hydrogenolysis) to yield the corresponding alcohol and toluene as a byproduct.\n\nCombining these transformations, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane ring, the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches the derived structure.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the result if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure incorrectly implies the tosylhydrazone survived the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure suggests an incorrect reaction pathway for the Shapiro reaction (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi).\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe chemical transformation occurs in four sequential steps. Let's analyze each one:\n\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which in this case is the one from the hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming an alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether. The product, **Product 1**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic acid. The ketone functional group reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The carbonyl group (C=O) of the cyclohexanone is converted to a C=N-NHTs group. **Product 2** is therefore N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride quench. This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi). The first deprotonates the nitrogen, and the second removes a proton from the carbon alpha to the original ketone. Deprotonation occurs at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon. Following elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas, a vinyllithium intermediate is formed, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. This sequence effectively replaces the ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond. The resulting **Product 3** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This powerful reducing condition has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the alcohol. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, yielding an alcohol and toluene as a byproduct.\n\nCombining these transformations, the benzyl ether is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group, the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, and the cyclohexene ring is saturated to a cyclohexane ring. The final structure, **Product 4**, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This would result from the reduction of the isopropenyl group and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether without the Shapiro reaction taking place.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies the n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile attacking the ketone, and that the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This structure indicates that the benzyl ether remained intact, which is unlikely under catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd/C.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches the final product after the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the hydroxyl group**\n    The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. It has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group). Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl group of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether. The product of this step, **Product 1**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This reaction is a standard method for forming benzyl ethers.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of a tosylhydrazone**\n    Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also called tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a standard condensation reaction. The resulting **Product 2** is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n*   **Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n    Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a strong base, at low temperature. This initiates a Shapiro reaction, which converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base are required. The first deprotonates the nitrogen, and the second removes a proton from the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl carbon. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride quenches this intermediate by protonation, yielding an alkene. The original ketone group at C1 is effectively removed and replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. Regioselectivity is controlled by the deprotonation of the alpha-proton; typically the less sterically hindered proton is removed, which in this case would lead to the formation of the double bond between C1 and C6. **Product 3** is therefore 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n    Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This powerful reducing system will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds present in the molecule. Additionally, Pd/C is a standard and effective catalyst for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, converting them back to alcohols.\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyl ether group is cleaved, regenerating the hydroxymethyl group.\n\nThe final structure, **Product 4**, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. This corresponds to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
