Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane:** This is the core structure. It consists of a cyclohexane ring fused with a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6. The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl:** There are methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S):** This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring in a planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to show the stereochemistry.\n*   The bicyclo[4.1.0] system implies a cis-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on a wedge).\n*   **At C1 (R):** The substituents are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, and -CH3. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must also be \"up\" (wedge), cis to the epoxide.\n*   **At C6 (S):** The substituents are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, and -H. For the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be \"down\" (dash), trans to the epoxide.\n*   **At C3 (R):** The substituents are -C2-, -C4-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be \"up\" (wedge).\n*   **At C4 (R):** The substituents are -C5-, -C3-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must also be \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:** The epoxide ring and all three methyl groups are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (we've defined this as \"up\" or beta).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and attack epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is a backside attack, meaning the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack**\n\nThe epoxide is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less sterically hindered.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The C6-O bond is \"up\" (wedge). The nucleophile (Me⁻) must perform a backside attack, so it will approach from the \"down\" side (dash).\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, forming a lithium alkoxide at C1. Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting configuration at C6 is **S**. The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of configuration, so the new stereocenter at this carbon will be **R**. The new methyl group will be \"down\" (alpha), and the original hydrogen at C6 will be pushed \"up\" (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry at other centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the reaction, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   C1 remains **R**.\n    *   C3 remains **R**.\n    *   C4 remains **R**.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol. The -OH group is at the original C1 position. There are methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), and C5(old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C3(old C4), C4(old C3), and C6(old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. So the name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted (S -> R) -> **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The prompt states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and are highly sensitive to steric hindrance. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to two other ring carbons (C2, C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom and two other ring carbons (C1, C5) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    Due to the significant steric bulk of the methyl group on C1 compared to the hydrogen on C6, the incoming nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will preferentially attack the less hindered **C6**. This regioselectivity eliminates options C and D, which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds through an S_N2-type mechanism. A key feature of the S_N2 reaction is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack).\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**.\n    *   The S_N2 attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an acidic workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions (C1, C3, C4) and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (original C1) is now C1. The carbon that was attacked (original C6) is now C2.\n*   The stereochemistry of the product will be:\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C6 inverts to become C2: (6S) → **(2R)**\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C3 retains its configuration and becomes C5: **(5R)**\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with the specified absolute configurations.\n    *   The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is across C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   The attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the oxygen (attached to C1) is later protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Constitution of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The starting molecule has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The product will have an -OH and a -CH₃ on the original C1. It will have a new -CH₃ on the original C6. It will retain the original -CH₃ groups at C3 and C4.\n    *   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at the new C1, new C2 (old C6), new C4 (old C4), and new C5 (old C3). The locants are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and B, which are constitutional isomers resulting from attack at the wrong carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) **retain their absolute configuration**.\n    *   Let's map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product:\n        *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n        *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R)\n        *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n        *   Reactant C6 (S) → Product C2 (inverted configuration)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options C and D.\n    *   The final step is to determine the configuration at C2, which results from the inversion of C6(S). While the geometric configuration is inverted, the R/S descriptor might not flip from S to R because the priorities of the substituents change. We must analyze this carefully.\n        *   Priorities at reactant C6: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   Priorities at product C2: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a Walden inversion, meaning the spatial arrangement of the three non-reacting groups (H, C1, C5) is inverted relative to the central carbon.\n        *   Let's analyze the consequence for the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that when the leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3), and the other priorities shift, the descriptor for the inverted center remains (S).\n        *   Therefore, C6(S) becomes C2(S) after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product has the absolute configuration (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This corresponds to the name (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the product of a chemical reaction.\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis:\n# 1.

The `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring. The fusion points are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring with the epoxide fused to it. The stereochemistry at C1 and C6 determines that the epoxide ring is cis-fused. Let's assume the oxygen atom is on the 'up' (beta) face of the ring.\n*   At **C1**, which is `R`, the C1-O bond is 'up'. For it to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C6**, which is `S`, the C6-O bond is 'up'. For it to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C3**, which is `R`, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C4**, which is `R`, the methyl group must also be 'down' (alpha).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the oxygen atom on one face, and all three methyl groups are on the opposite face.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n\nThe reagent is **Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, a Gilman reagent.\n*   This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe problem states a key rule for organocuprates reacting with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n*   Clearly, C6 is sterically less hindered than C1.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This means the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken (the backside).\n*   In our structure, the C6-O bond is on the 'up' face.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile must attack C6 from the **'down' face**.\n*   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed to the 'up' position. The new methyl group is added to the 'down' position.\n*   The C1-O bond also breaks (after the initial attack), and upon aqueous workup, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\nLet's summarize the resulting structure:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is opened to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is at the original C1 position, and its stereochemistry is retained ('up').\n*   The methyl group at the original C1 position remains 'down'.\n*   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain 'down'.\n*   A new methyl group is added at the original C6 position and is 'down'.\n\nNow, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   **Parent Name:** The main functional group is the alcohol, so it is a `cyclohexanol`. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Starting from the OH-carbon as C1, numbering counter-clockwise (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give locants {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so we use this numbering scheme.\n*   **Full Name (without stereochemistry):** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the R/S configuration for the chiral centers in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   **New C1 (original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was R in the starting material. So, it is **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (original C6):** The configuration is inverted due to the Sₙ2 attack. The original configuration was S. One might assume it becomes R, but we must re-evaluate using CIP rules because the substituent priorities have changed.\n    *   At New C2, the groups are H ('up'), Me ('down'), C1, and C3.\n    *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards us ('up'), we trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group towards the viewer means the configuration is **S**. So, it is **2S**.\n*   **New C4 (original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` means the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, which defines an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given R/S configurations define the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows:\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the α-face (pointing \"down\" relative to the plane of the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The hydrogen atom at C6 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that organocuprates attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack. The problem states that this results in an \"inversion of configuration\" at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.\n    *   The nucleophile (CH₃⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the α-face (down).\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will attack C6 from the β-face (top).\n\n**3. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack at C6:** The incoming methyl group adds to the β-face of C6. The C6-O bond breaks. This causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration of C6 was S, so the new configuration at this carbon will be R.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not affected by the reaction, so the -OH group will be on the α-face (down), just as the oxygen atom was.\n3.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they retain their original R configurations.\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned the lowest possible number, C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant is the new C1 of the product.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now substituted with the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (The alternative numbering would give 1, 3, 4, 6, which is a higher set of locants).\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3\n3.  **Base Name:** The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe now assign the R/S configuration to each stereocenter in the product based on the reaction mechanism:\n*   **New C1 (from Old C1):** The configuration is retained. Old C1 was R. → **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (from Old C6):** The configuration is inverted. Old C6 was S. → **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (from Old C4):** The configuration is retained. Old C4 was R. → **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (from Old C3):** The configuration is retained. Old C3 was R. → **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which can be used to determine the structure of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring, and the \"7-oxa\" designation confirms this is an epoxide. The stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S) defines the specific three-dimensional arrangement of the substituents. Based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the epoxide oxygen and the methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 are all on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (beta, or 'up').\n\n2.  **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, lithium dimethylcuprate. In this reagent, the methyl group (Me) acts as a soft nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The first rule provided states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack this position.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The second rule states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an S_N2-type reaction mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond of the epoxide (anti-attack).\n    *   In the starting material, the epoxide ring is on the beta face ('up').\n    *   The methyl nucleophile must therefore attack C6 from the alpha face ('down').\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The hydrogen originally at C6 (alpha) is pushed to the beta position, and the new methyl group takes the alpha position.\n    *   The C1-O bond also breaks (as part of the ring opening), and the oxygen atom is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked and retains its original configuration. The resulting -OH group will be on the beta face.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected by the reaction and retain their configurations.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, a new product is formed:\n*   The cyclohexane ring remains.\n*   An alcohol (-OH) is formed at C1, with beta stereochemistry.\n*   A new methyl group is added at C6, with alpha stereochemistry.\n*   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 retain their positions and stereochemistry.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. Numbering proceeds around the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, which results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThe final step is to assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each chiral center in the product:\n*   **C1:** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C2 (originally C6):** The starting configuration was S. The SN2 attack causes a geometric inversion. However, due to changes in substituent priorities under the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the final designation for this center is S. This is a known phenomenon where geometric inversion does not lead to an R/S descriptor change.\n*   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its original R configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe analysis of the reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate relies on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) mechanism. This mechanism has specific consequences for both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring (forming the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core). The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. There are methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates are known to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a secondary carbon.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry:**\nThe reaction proceeds through an SN2-type mechanism, which results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus remain unchanged as (1R, 3R, 4R).\n\n**4. Product Identification and Nomenclature:**\nThe attack of the methyl group on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and subsequent protonation (during workup) places a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1. The resulting product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name the product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the highest priority and is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the carbon that was attacked (the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Stereochemical Assignment:**\nCombining the stereochemical outcomes with the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThus, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction involves the ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this reaction are key to determining the correct product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and, in reactions with epoxides, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom and carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and three other carbons (C2, C5, and C6).\n    *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen and three other carbons (C1, C2, and C5).\n    *   Comparing the two, C6 is the less sterically hindered position. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   This causes an inversion of the stereochemistry at C6. The starting material has a (6S) configuration. After the reaction, this center will have an (R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming step with the nucleophile, so its configuration (1R) is retained.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected, so their configurations (3R, 4R) are retained.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure\n\n*   **Attack at C6**: The methyl group adds to C6.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the C1-O bond becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an aqueous workup (which is implicit in this type of reaction).\n*   **Resulting Structure**: The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 from the original molecule, plus a new methyl group at the site of attack (C6).\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product**:\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. This carbon also has a methyl group.\n    *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (originally C6) is now C2. It has the newly added methyl group.\n    *   The original C4 is still C4.\n    *   The original C3 is now C5.\n    *   The product is named 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### Determining the Product Stereochemistry\n\n*   **C1**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C2 (from C6)**: Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n*   **C4 (from C4)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C5 (from C3)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe calculated product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, C1 and C6.

Let's assume the plane of the cyclohexane ring is the reference.\n\n1.  Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing 'up' (beta face).\n2.  We need to place the substituents (Me on C1, H on C6, Me on C3, Me on C4) as either 'up' (beta) or 'down' (alpha) to satisfy the given R/S configurations.\n    *   **At C6 (S):** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be S, the H at C6 must also be 'up' (beta, syn to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C1 (R):** The groups are O, C6, C2, Me. Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha, anti to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C4 (R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, H. Priorities are C3 > C5 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must be 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C3 (R):** The groups are C4, C2, Me, H. Priorities are C4 > C2 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be 'down' (alpha).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide oxygen: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Methyl: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **up (beta)**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). The nucleophile is effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6. The C6-O bond is 'up' (beta), so the attack occurs from the 'down' (alpha) side.\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom becomes an alkoxide (O⁻), which is then protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n3.  Let's trace the stereochemistry of each part of the molecule:\n    *   **At C1:** The configuration is **retained**. The original C1-Me was 'down' (alpha), and it remains 'down'. The C1-O bond was 'up' (beta), so the new C1-OH group is 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C6:** The configuration is **inverted**. The incoming methyl group adds from the 'down' (alpha) side. The original C6-H was 'up' (beta), and it remains 'up'.\n    *   **At C3 and C4:** These centers are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are **retained**. C3-Me remains 'down' (alpha), and C4-Me remains 'up' (beta).\n\n**Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry:**\n*   C1-OH: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Me: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Me (newly added): **down (alpha)**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Numbering:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The -OH group gets priority, so it is on C1. We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on C1, C3, C4, and C6 of the original ring.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C6 → C5 → C4 → C3 → C2 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5 → C6 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}. So the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches options A and B.\n\n2.  **Assigning R/S Configuration to the Product:** We use the relative stereochemistry determined in Step 3 and the new numbering system.\n    *   New C1 is original C1.\n    *   New C2 is original C6.\n    *   New C4 is original C4.\n    *   New C5 is original C3.\n\n    Let's assign the configuration for each chiral center using wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha).\n    *   **C1:** OH (wedge), Me (dash). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Looking down the C1-Me bond (lowest priority, dash), the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from C6):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C2-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C1 → C3 → Me is clockwise. Since we are looking from the front, we reverse the result. Clockwise → Counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (from C4):** Me (wedge), H (dash). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C4-H bond (lowest priority, dash), the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from C3):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Looking down the C5-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C4 → C6 → Me is counter-clockwise. Reverse the result. Counter-clockwise → Clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\nThe full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Scaffold:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, which are numbered C1 and C6 according to bicyclic nomenclature.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration at the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure. We can draw the molecule in a half-chair conformation, which is typical for cyclohexene derivatives. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C1 (must be R):** The priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH3. For the configuration to be (R) with the oxygen \"up\", the C1-methyl group must be pointing \"down\" (on the α face).\n*   **At C6 (must be S):** The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be (S) with the oxygen \"up\", the hydrogen at C6 must also be pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C3 (must be R):** The priorities are C4(with Me) > C2 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C3-methyl group must be in an axial-like \"down\" position (α face).\n*   **At C4 (must be R):** The priorities are C3(with Me) > C5 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C4-methyl group must be in an equatorial-like \"up\" position (β face).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the following stereochemical features (visualized with the epoxide ring on the top face):\n*   Epoxide O: Up (β)\n*   C1-Me: Down (α)\n*   C3-Me: Down (α)\n*   C4-Me: Up (β)\n*   C6-H: Up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is a methyl anion (Me⁻), which is considered a \"soft\" nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is \"up\" (β), the methyl group will attack from the \"down\" side (α). This is known as an anti-diaxial opening.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The Me⁻ group attacks C6 from the α face (\"down\").\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen, which is attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n3.  A subsequent acidic workup (not explicitly shown but always implied) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n4.  The resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexanol. The ring will adopt a stable chair conformation.\n\nLet's track the stereochemistry of each group in the product:\n*   **At C1:** The C1-O bond becomes C1-OH. Since the oxygen was \"up\" (β), the OH group is \"up\" (β). The original C1-Me group was \"down\" (α) and remains so.\n*   **At C6:** The incoming Me group attacks from \"down\" (α). The original H at C6 was \"up\" (β) and remains so.\n*   **At C3 & C4:** The methyl groups are not involved in the reaction and retain their original stereochemistry: C3-Me is \"down\" (α) and C4-Me is \"up\" (β).\n\n**Step 4: Name the Product and Determine its Absolute Configuration**\n\nFirst, we need to number the cyclohexane ring of the product according to IUPAC rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group is **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the epoxide.\n\nWe then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Path 1 (clockwise): C1 -> orig C2 -> orig C3 -> orig C4 -> orig C5 -> orig C6. Methyl groups are at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n*   Path 2 (counter-clockwise): C1 -> orig C6 -> orig C5 -> orig C4 -> orig C3 -> orig C2. Methyl groups are at 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nThe set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nNow, we must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) of the most stable conformer.\n\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** The anti-diaxial opening initially produces a high-energy chair conformer with the C1-OH and the new C2-Me in axial positions. The ring will flip to a more stable conformer.\n    *   Initial conformer (less stable): C1-OH (axial), C1-Me (equatorial), C2-Me (axial), C4-Me (equatorial), C5-Me (axial). (3 axial groups)\n    *   Flipped conformer (more stable): C1-OH (equatorial), C1-Me (axial), C2-Me (equatorial), C4-Me (axial), C5-Me (equatorial). (2 axial groups)\n    We will assign the R/S configuration based on this more stable flipped conformer.\n\n*   **R/S Assignment (on the stable conformer):**\n    *   **C1:** Has OH (eq, β), Me (ax, α). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Viewing down the C1-Me (axial) bond, the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (orig C6):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C2-H (axial) bond, the path C1 → C3 → Me is counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (orig C4):** Has Me (ax, β), H (eq, α). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C4-H (equatorial) bond is tricky, but careful analysis shows the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (orig C3):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Viewing down the C5-H (axial) bond, the path C4 → C6 → Me is clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\nCombining these results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to predict the product of a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide using an organocuprate reagent.

This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide but has no methyl substituent. It is bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 attack inverts this configuration, so the new stereocenter at this position will be **(R)**.\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (which is standard procedure to isolate the alcohol product) protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\nThe reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   **Structure:** The product has an -OH group at the original C1 position and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are also present.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as **C1** in the product's name.\n    2.  We must number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible set of locants. The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one on C6.\n        *   **Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups are at positions 1 (on new C1), 2 (the new methyl on original C6), 4 (on original C4), and 5 (on original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   **Numbering clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the locant sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower. Thus, the correct base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Assigning Final Stereochemistry:** We use the correct (counter-clockwise) numbering to assign the stereodescriptors.\n    *   **New C1** (was original C1): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (was original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (was original C4): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (was original C3): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n\nThe full and correct IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This matches our result perfectly.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this mechanism).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge is an oxygen atom, meaning this is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   To determine the 3D structure, we use the given stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S). We can draw the molecule on a plane with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to represent its stereochemistry. A consistent assignment is:\n        *   The epoxide oxygen is on the 'up' face (beta, wedge).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (1R) configuration. (Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (6S) configuration. (Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (3R) configuration. (Priorities: C4 > C2 > Me > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (4R) configuration. (Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H).\n    *   So, the starting material has the epoxide ring on one face of the cyclohexane ring, and the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are all on the opposite face.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent and Reaction:**\n    *   The reagent is **Me2CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n        1.  The alkyl group attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Attack:**\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   C6 is less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n    *   In our model, the C6-O bond is 'up'. Thus, the Me⁻ attacks C6 from the 'down' side.\n    *   This attack causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed 'up'. The new methyl group from the cuprate is added to the 'down' position.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen atom, which is still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). After acidic workup (implied), it becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C1-O bond was 'up', the resulting OH group at C1 will also be 'up'.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The OH group is at C1 and is 'up'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4 is 'down'.\n    *   The new methyl group (from Me2CuLi) is at C6 and is 'down'.\n    *   So, the final product has an 'up' OH group, and all four methyl groups are 'down' (i.e., trans to the OH group).\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   First, we must number the product according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6. Numbering from the new C1 (original C1), the methyl locants are {1, 3, 4, 6}, regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   *Note*: The options provide product names with locants {1, 2, 4, 5} or {2, 2, 4, 5}. This indicates a flaw in the problem statement, as the locants derived from the starting material do not match those in the options. We must assume this is a typo in the question and proceed by determining the correct stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the product we've derived, and find the option that matches it. The most likely scenario is that the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes C2 in the product name provided in the options.\n    *   Now, we assign the R/S configuration to each chiral center of our derived product structure (OH up, all four Me down), assuming the numbering {1, 2, 4, 5} as given in options B and D.\n        *   **C1**: Has OH(up), Me(down). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. With Me(4) pointing away (down/dash), the sequence OH(1)→C2(2)→C6(3) is clockwise. Thus, **C1 is (R)**.\n        *   **C2 (original C6)**: Has new Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C1(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. Since H is towards us, we reverse the assignment. Thus, **C2 is (S)**.\n        *   **C4**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C5(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is counter-clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C4 is (R)**.\n        *   **C5**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C4(1)→C6(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C5 is (S)**.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the C5 assignment using a chair conformation, as planar drawings can be misleading. In the most stable chair, C5-Me is axial (down) and C5-H is equatorial (up). Let's put the lowest priority group (H) in the back by rotating the molecule. This is complex. Let's re-verify the C5 R/S assignment from the options. Both B and D list C5 as (R). Let's re-calculate.\n    *   Let's use the stable chair conformation: OH(eq,up), C1-Me(ax,down), C2-Me(eq,down), C4-Me(eq,down), C5-Me(ax,down).\n        *   **C5**: Me is axial down (away). H is equatorial up (front-ish). Priorities: C4(1) > C6(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Let's put Me(3) in the back. The sequence C4(1) -> C6(2) -> H(4) is clockwise. So, **C5 is (R)**.\n    *   So the calculated stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Our calculated product stereochemistry is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This matches option B exactly.\n\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived stereochemistry.**\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nDespite the inconsistency in the locant numbering between the starting material and the options, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction points unambiguously to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules regarding its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which are key to determining the final product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are also methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: Me2CuLi (a Gilman reagent) provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me-).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are considered \"soft\" nucleophiles. In reactions with epoxides, they preferentially attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material. Due to the SN2 inversion, its configuration in the product will become (R).\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained, so it remains (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations also remain (R).\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The reaction adds a new methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The original C1 (now with an -OH and a methyl group) is the new C1.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one), 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred as it is lower. Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n3.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **Product C1** (from reactant C1): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C2** (from reactant C6): Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **Product C4** (from reactant C4): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C5** (from reactant C3): Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction between saturated epoxides and organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is based on well-established principles of organic chemistry.

The stereochemistry of the chiral centers is specified.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), often called a Gilman reagent, serves as a source for a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**: The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane structure.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity (3D Arrangement)**: The reaction is an SN2 substitution. This type of reaction is known to proceed with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is (S).\n    *   Following the SN2 attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4), which are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the nucleophilic attack, are retained.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide.\n    *   An alkoxide intermediate is formed, with the oxygen still attached to C1.\n    *   A subsequent acidic workup (a standard procedure in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide, yielding a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n5.  **Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**:\n    *   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1.

We will use wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha).\n\n*   To satisfy the given stereochemical descriptors (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S), the correct structure is:\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is **alpha** (pointing down, dashed).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is **beta** (pointing up, wedged).\n    *   The hydrogen at C6 is **beta** (pointing up, wedged).\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is **beta** (pointing up, wedged).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is **alpha** (pointing down, dashed).\n\nLet's verify this assignment:\n*   **C1 (R):** Priorities: O(1) > C6(2) > C2(3) > Me(4).

Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nBased on the reaction, the substituents and their stereochemistry in the product are:\n*   At C1: An **alpha** -OH group and a **beta** methyl group.\n*   At C3: A **beta** methyl group (unchanged).\n*   At C4: An **alpha** methyl group (unchanged).\n*   At C6: A new **beta** methyl group (from the cuprate) and an **alpha** hydrogen (due to inversion).\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The parent compound is a cyclohexanol. The OH group defines C1. To give the methyl substituents the lowest locants, we number counter-clockwise.\n    *   Old C1 -> New C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   Old C6 -> New C2 (has a new -Me)\n    *   Old C5 -> New C3\n    *   Old C4 -> New C4 (has -Me)\n    *   Old C3 -> New C5 (has -Me)\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This confirms we should be looking at options C and D.\n\n*   **Assign R/S to the product's stereocenters:**\n    *   A careful R/S assignment on the product derived from the named starting material yields (1S, 2R, 4S, 5S). This does not match any of the options.\n    *   However, its enantiomer is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R), which matches option D. This suggests there might be an error in the provided name of the starting material in the question, and the intended reactant was the enantiomer. Let's verify this by reacting the enantiomer.\n\n**Alternative Path: Reacting the Enantiomer**\n\n*   Let's assume the starting material was the enantiomer: (1S,3S,4S,6R).\n    *   Structure: Epoxide-beta, C1-Me-alpha, C6-H-alpha, C3-Me-alpha, C4-Me-beta.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    *   Attack at C6 (less hindered).\n    *   C6-O bond is beta (up), so attack is from the alpha side (down).\n    *   New Me at C6 is alpha. H at C6 inverts to beta.\n    *   -OH at C1 is beta.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   At C1: beta -OH, alpha -Me.\n    *   At C6: alpha -Me, beta -H.\n    *   At C3: alpha -Me.\n    *   At C4: beta -Me.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry (after re-numbering):**\n    *   New C1: **R**\n    *   New C2: **S**\n    *   New C4: **R**\n    *   New C5: **R**\n*   This gives the product **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D exactly. Given the choices, it is highly probable that the intended reaction leads to this product.\n\nFinal Answer is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe reaction between an organocuprate, like lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), and an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The outcome of this reaction is governed by specific rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction involves (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). The bicyclic compound is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons 1 and 6. The nucleophile provided by the cuprate is a methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The first rule provided states that the incoming alkyl group (the nucleophile) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is formed between carbon C1 and carbon C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is also a tertiary carbon, but it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered position, and the nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack C6. This determines the connectivity of the resulting product, eliminating options that would arise from an attack at C1. The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, leaving the oxygen attached to C1, which becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an aqueous workup.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The second rule states that an inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon atom that is attacked. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The initial stereochemical configuration of C6 is given as (S).\n    *   Due to the Sₙ2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters in the molecule (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Initial Stereochemistry**:\n    *   C1: R\n    *   C3: R\n    *   C4: R\n    *   C6: S\n*   **Reaction Outcome**:\n    *   Attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The ring opens, and the C1-O bond becomes a C1-OH group. The stereocenter at C1 remains (R).\n    *   A new methyl group attaches to C6, and its stereocenter inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 remain (R).\n*   **Product Naming (IUPAC)**: The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6).\n    *   **New C1** corresponds to the **Old C1**. It has an -OH group and a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** corresponds to the **Old C6**. It now has a methyl group. Its configuration has inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** corresponds to the **Old C4**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** corresponds to the **Old C3**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Reaction Analysis**\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction is between a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and an organocuprate (Gilman reagent), Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The Gilman reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (CH3-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Where does the nucleophile attack?**\n*   Organocuprates are \"soft\" nucleophiles and react with epoxides via an SN2-like mechanism. A key rule for this reaction is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The substrate `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   Let's examine the substitution at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is a secondary carbon center.\n*   Comparing the tertiary C1 and the secondary C6, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity: What is the stereochemical outcome?**\n*   The SN2 reaction mechanism involves a backside attack, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The configurations of chiral centers not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n*   Let's track the stereochemistry of each chiral center:\n    *   **Attack Site (C6):** The initial configuration at C6 is (S). Since the nucleophile attacks this carbon, its configuration will be inverted to **(R)**.\n    *   **Other Chiral Centers (C1, C3, C4):** These centers are not attacked. No bonds to these chiral atoms are broken or formed. Therefore, their configurations are retained.\n        *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring by adding a new methyl group to C6 and, after an aqueous workup, forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we prioritize the hydroxyl group. The carbon it's attached to (the original C1) becomes the new C1.\n*   We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (New C1 ← Old C1; New C2 ← Old C6; New C4 ← Old C4; New C5 ← Old C3). This gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Combining this with the stereochemistry determined in step 3:\n    *   New C1 (from old C1) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C2 (from old C6) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C4 (from old C4) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from old C3) is **(R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5.

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is A.\n\nThe correct option is: A\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze and Draw the Reactant Structure\nThe reactant is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6, and the oxygen is atom 7. This is a derivative of cyclohexene oxide.\n2.  **Substituents**: `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute configuration of the chiral centers. To satisfy all these configurations simultaneously, we must determine the orientation of the epoxide and the methyl groups.\n    *   Let's assume the cyclohexane ring is in a chair-like conformation.\n    *   A careful analysis of the R/S configurations reveals the following structure:\n        *   The epoxide ring is on the **alpha face** (pointing down).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n\n    *   **Verification of Stereocenters:**\n        *   **C1 (1R)**: Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the epoxide down (alpha) and Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n        *   **C6 (6S)**: Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the epoxide down (alpha) and H up (beta), the configuration is S.\n        *   **C3 (3R)**: Priorities C2 > C4 > Me > H. With Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n        *   **C4 (4R)**: Priorities C3 > C5 > Me > H. With Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction\n*   **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a \"soft\" methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction**: Organocuprates react with epoxides in an SN2-type nucleophilic ring-opening reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity\n*   The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n*   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity\n*   The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond).\n*   The epoxide ring is on the alpha face (down). So, the C6-O bond is pointing downwards.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the **beta face (up)**. This is called *anti*-attack.\n*   The SN2 reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Product Structure\n1.  **Attack at C6**: A new methyl group adds to C6 from the beta face (up).\n2.  **Inversion at C6**: The hydrogen atom originally at C6 (beta, up) is pushed to the alpha face (down).\n3.  **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n4.  **Work-up**: The resulting alkoxide ion at C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was alpha (down), the OH group will be on the alpha face (down).\n5.  **Spectator Groups**: The methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected and retain their beta (up) orientation.\n\n*   **Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The OH group is at C1 (alpha, down).\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is beta (up).\n    *   The new methyl group at C6 is beta (up).\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is beta (up).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is beta (up).\n    *   In conclusion, all four methyl groups are *cis* to each other (beta/up), and the hydroxyl group is *trans* to all of them (alpha/down).\n\n### Step 6: Name the Product and Assign Absolute Configurations\n1.  **IUPAC Numbering**: The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To give the substituents the lowest locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Old C1 → New C1 (has OH, Me)\n    *   Old C6 → New C2 (has Me)\n    *   Old C5 → New C3\n    *   Old C4 → New C4 (has Me)\n    *   Old C3 → New C5 (has Me)\n    *   The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n2.  **Assign R/S Configuration**: We assign the absolute configuration to each chiral center (C1, C2, C4, C5) based on the 3D structure derived in Step 5.\n    *   **C1**: Attached to OH (down), Me (up), C2, C6. Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C2**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C1, C3. Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **S**. (Note: SN2 inversion occurred, but due to changes in substituent priorities, the S descriptor of reactant C6 remains S for product C2).\n    *   **C4**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C3, C5. Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C5**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C4, C6. Priorities: C6 > C4 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n\n3.  **Final Product Name**: The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Step 7: Compare with Options\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived structure and name.**\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The name indicates the following:\n        *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: A 6-membered ring (cyclohexane) fused with a 3-membered ring (the epoxide). The epoxide bridge is between carbons C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are located on carbons C1, C3, and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem states: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and O7.\n    *   Carbon C1 is attached to a methyl group, C2, C6, and O7. It is a quaternary carbon (tetrasubstituted).\n    *   Carbon C6 is attached to a hydrogen, C1, C5, and O7. It is a tertiary carbon (trisubstituted).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanol derivative where the -OH group is at the position of the original C1, and a new methyl group is at the position of the original C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product Skeleton:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) is designated as C1 in the product's IUPAC name.\n    *   This C1 also has the original methyl group from the starting material.\n    *   The new methyl group from the cuprate is on the adjacent carbon (original C6), which becomes C2 in the product name (numbering to give substituents the lowest locants).\n    *   The other original methyl groups are at C3 and C4 of the starting material. In the new numbering scheme, these become C5 and C4, respectively.\n    *   Product numbering: New C1 = Old C1; New C2 = Old C6; New C3 = Old C5; New C4 = Old C4; New C5 = Old C3; New C6 = Old C2.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The configurations of the chiral centers that are not part of the reaction (old C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   The configuration of the chiral center that is attacked (old C6) is inverted.\n\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted. The starting configuration was **S**. An inversion of stereochemistry means the 3D arrangement of the groups is flipped (e.g., a group that was 'down' is pushed 'up' by the incoming nucleophile from 'down'). We must determine the resulting R/S designation based on the new structure and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n\n    *   **Let's analyze the inversion at C6 -> C2:**\n        *   **At Old C6:** The configuration is S. The CIP priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n        *   **Reaction:** A backside attack replaces the C6-O bond with a C6-Me bond. The geometry inverts.\n        *   **At New C2 (Old C6):** The groups are now C1, C5 (which is new C3), H, and a new Me.\n        *   **New CIP priorities at C2:** The priority of the attached groups changes. C1 (bearing an OH group) is priority 1. C3 (a CH₂ group in the ring) is priority 2. The new methyl group is priority 3. Hydrogen is priority 4. So, C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   **Determining the new R/S label:** We must determine the configuration from the inverted geometry. The SN2 attack forces the substituents to flip their relative positions. If the original H at C6 was, for example, *alpha* (dashed, pointing down), the inversion would push it to *beta* (wedged, pointing up) as the new methyl group attacks from the *alpha* face.\n        *   Let's assume the starting epoxide O was *beta* (wedged). Then the H at C6 must be *alpha* (dashed) for the molecule to have S configuration.\n        *   After inversion, the new Me is *alpha* (dashed) and H is *beta* (wedged).\n        *   To determine the configuration at New C2, we look at the arrangement: C1(1), C3(2), Me(3, dashed), H(4, wedged).\n        *   According to the CIP rules, when the lowest priority group (H, priority 4) is wedged (pointing towards the viewer), we determine the direction of the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n        *   The sequence C1 -> C3 -> Me traces a clockwise (R) path.\n        *   Since H(4) is wedged, we reverse R to S.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at New C2 is **S**.\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Product Name:**\n    *   Skeleton: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Stereochemistry:\n        *   C1: **R**\n        *   C2: **S**\n        *   C4: **R**\n        *   C5: **R**\n    *   The full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The core structure is a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states that the alkyl group of the cuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a general rule for the S_N2-type opening of epoxides by basic or neutral nucleophiles.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6, the sterically less hindered position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group at C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   After an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom (attached to C1) is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. Let's determine their positions based on IUPAC nomenclature for the final product:\n        *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. This carbon also has its original methyl group.\n        *   Numbering the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants, the adjacent carbon (the original C6) where the new methyl group attached becomes C2.\n        *   The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 of the reactant are now at positions C5 and C4, respectively, in the product.\n        *   Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This allows us to eliminate options B and C.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity**: The problem states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the S_N2 reaction, where the nucleophile performs a backside attack relative to the leaving group.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (S) as given in the reactant's name.\n    *   The inversion of configuration means the stereocenter at this carbon will become (R) in the product.\n    *   In the product's IUPAC name, this carbon is C2. Therefore, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C3 and C4 in the reactant) are expected to retain their configuration. In the product, these correspond to C5 and C4. The reactant had (3R) and (4R), which correspond to (5R) and (4R) in the product.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is given as (1R) in the reactant. This center is not attacked, and its configuration is generally retained.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the product must be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol with a (2R), (4R), and (5R) configuration. Comparing the remaining options:\n    *   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe inversion at the site of attack (reactant C6 becoming product C2) from (S) to (R) definitively points to option D as the correct product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe reaction involves the opening of a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by a Gilman reagent, Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). To determine the final product, we must consider the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of this reaction.\n\n**1. Structure of the Reactant:**\nThe starting material is a bicyclic epoxide. The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered epoxide ring. The epoxide connects carbons 1 and 6. The molecule is further substituted with methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4, with the specific stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (a soft nucleophile) is an Sₙ2-type reaction. As a general rule, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide ring and is bonded to a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide ring but is only bonded to hydrogen atoms (and the ring carbons), making it a secondary carbon.\n\nTherefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe ring-opening proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves a backside attack by the nucleophile. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the point of attack, C6, is **S**.\n*   After the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to **R**.\n\nThe C1-O bond of the epoxide will break, and the oxygen will be protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The stereochemistry at C1 is not inverted as no bonds to the stereocenter are broken. Similarly, the stereocenters at C3 and C4 are unaffected by the reaction.\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   **Initial Stereocenters:** C1 (R), C3 (R), C4 (R), C6 (S).\n*   **Nucleophile:** A methyl group (Me).\n*   **Attack Site:** C6.\n*   **Resulting Stereocenters in the Product (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols):**\n    *   The original C1 becomes **C1** of the cyclohexanol. It retains its **R** configuration. It bears the hydroxyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   The original C6 becomes **C2**. The attack causes inversion from S to **R**. It now bears a new methyl group from the cuprate.\n    *   The original C3 becomes **C4**. It retains its **R** configuration.\n    *   The original C4 becomes **C5**. It retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **Nomenclature:** The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Final Name:** Combining the stereochemistry and the structure gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states, and chemical principles confirm, that the nucleophilic alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide is formed across carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not. Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction is an Sₙ2 displacement, which occurs with a complete inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked. The initial configuration at C6 is given as (S). The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n\n3.  **Fate of Other Stereocenters**:\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they will retain their original (R) configurations.\n    *   The bond between C1 and the epoxide oxygen is cleaved, and upon workup, this oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the nucleophilic attack does not occur at C1, its configuration is retained as (R).\n\n### Determining the Product:\n\n*   **Starting Material Stereochemistry (Original Numbering)**: C1 is (R), C3 is (R), C4 is (R), and C6 is (S).\n*   **Reaction Outcome**: The methyl group attacks C6, inverting its stereocenter from (S) to (R). The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain unchanged.\n*   **Product Structure**: The reaction opens the bicyclic ring to form a substituted cyclohexanol. The original C1 now bears both its original methyl group and a new hydroxyl group. The original C6 now bears the new methyl group from the cuprate.\n*   **IUPAC Renumbering**: For naming the product, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The adjacent carbon, the original C6, becomes the new C2. Following this, the original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry (IUPAC Numbering)**:\n    *   New C1 (from original C1): (R)\n    *   New C2 (from original C6): Inverts from (S) to (R)\n    *   New C4 (from original C4): (R)\n    *   New C5 (from original C3): (R)\n\nThe resulting product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol with the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The name also provides the absolute stereochemistry at these chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction**\nThe problem statement provides the key rules for this transformation:\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (the methyl group from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereospecificity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1, C6, and the oxygen atom. The two carbons where the attack can occur are C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two positions:\n    *   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to the oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group. It is a **tertiary** carbon center (within the bicyclic system).\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to the oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom. It is a **secondary** carbon center.\n*   A secondary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, according to the rule, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   When the methyl nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n*   A subsequent acidic workup (implied in this type of reaction) protonates the resulting alkoxide (O⁻) to form an alcohol (OH) group.\n*   Therefore, the final product will have:\n    *   An OH group at the position of the original C1.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4.\n    *   A **new** methyl group at C6.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. Let's determine its IUPAC name. The carbon bearing the OH group receives the lowest number, so the original C1 is the new C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The adjacent carbon (the original C6) has the newly added methyl group, so we number in that direction.\n    *   New C1 = Original C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Original C6 (has new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Original C5\n    *   New C4 = Original C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Original C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Original C2\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The starting material has the absolute configuration: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack at C6. This means the stereochemistry at C6 will be inverted.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) will retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's track the changes:\n    *   Configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C3 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C6 inverts from **S** to **R**.\n*   Now, we map these configurations onto the newly numbered product:\n    *   Product C1 (from original C1) has the configuration **(1R)**.\n    *   Product C2 (from original C6) has the configuration **(2R)**.\n    *   Product C4 (from original C4) has the configuration **(4R)**.\n    *   Product C5 (from original C3) has the configuration **(5R)**.\n*   The full IUPAC name for the product, including stereochemistry, is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6.

Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The numbering system for bicyclic compounds starts at one bridgehead (C1), goes around the longest bridge (C2-C3-C4-C5) to the other bridgehead (C6), and then numbers the atoms in the shorter bridge (O7).\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This is the most complex part. We need to determine the 3D arrangement of all groups.\n    *   The fusion of the epoxide to the 6-membered ring must be **cis**. This means the two C-O bonds (C1-O7 and C6-O7) are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing **up (beta)**.\n    *   This cis-fusion forces the other substituents on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C6) to be on the opposite face. In this case, the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C6. However, the given stereochemistry (1R, 6S) seems contradictory if both are *trans* to the epoxide. Let's verify.\n        *   **Priorities at C1:** O > C6 > C2 > Me. If Me is down (alpha, trans to the up-epoxide), the configuration is (1R). This matches the name.\n        *   **Priorities at C6:** O > C1 > C5 > H. If H is down (alpha, trans to the up-epoxide), the configuration is (6R). This contradicts the name (6S).\n    *   To obtain (6S), the hydrogen at C6 must be **up (beta, cis to the up-epoxide)**. A swap from down to up inverts the configuration from R to S. This implies an unusual conformation, but it is necessary to satisfy the given IUPAC name.\n    *   **Stereocenters C3 and C4:** For (3R) and (4R), with the methyl groups being higher priority than hydrogen, both methyl groups must be pointing **up (beta)**. They are cis to each other and cis to the epoxide ring.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide ring: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C1: **down (alpha)**\n*   Hydrogen at C6: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C3: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C4: **up (beta)**\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Rule 1: Regioselectivity:** The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n    *   This immediately rules out options A and B, which would result from an attack at C1. (Attack at C1 would lead to a product with an OH on C6 and two methyls on C1, which when re-numbered according to IUPAC rules gives a 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanol derivative).\n\n*   **Rule 2: Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n    *   This is a classic Sₙ2-type reaction. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   Since the epoxide C-O bond at C6 is **up (beta)**, the `Me⁻` nucleophile must attack from the **down (alpha)** side.\n    *   The configuration at C6, which was **(S)**, will invert to **(R)**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product Structure and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The `Me⁻` attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n2.  **Stereochemistry of Centers:**\n    *   **Center of Attack (Old C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to (R). In the final product, this carbon will be C2 in the IUPAC name. So, we expect a **(2R)** configuration.\n    *   **Other Epoxide Carbon (Old C1):** This carbon is not attacked, and its configuration is retained. It started as (1R) and remains **(1R)**. This will be C1 in the product name.\n    *   **Other Chiral Centers (Old C3 and C4):** These are remote from the reaction site, so their configurations are also retained. Old C3 was (R), and Old C4 was (R).\n3.  **Renaming the Product (IUPAC):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the -OH at Old C1, so this carbon becomes **New C1**.\n    *   To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number clockwise around the ring.\n    *   Old C6 (the site of attack) becomes **New C2**.\n    *   Old C5 becomes **New C3**.\n    *   Old C4 becomes **New C4**.\n    *   Old C3 becomes **New C5**.\n    *   Old C2 becomes **New C6**.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the base name for options C and D.\n\n4.  **Final Stereochemistry of Product:**\n    *   New C1 (from Old C1) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C2 (from Old C6) is **(R)** due to inversion.\n    *   New C4 (from Old C4) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from Old C3) is **(R)**.\n\nThe resulting product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 4.

It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`CH₃⁻`).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem gives two crucial rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereochemistry:** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the point of attack (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regiochemistry):**\n*   We compare the steric hindrance at the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it's bonded to a methyl group.\n*   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, as it's bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n*   The methyl group on C1 makes it significantly more crowded than C6. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. A subsequent workup step protonates the oxygen (now on C1) to form an alcohol (-OH).\n*   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexanol. To name it correctly, the carbon with the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes the new C2.\n*   The substituents on the product are:\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group on the new C1.\n    *   The newly added methyl group on the new C2.\n    *   The original methyl group from C4 is now on the new C4.\n    *   The original methyl group from C3 is now on the new C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n*   **At C2 (the site of attack, original C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration. The starting material was `(6S)`. Inversion of S gives R. So, the product is **(2R)**.\n*   **At C1, C4, C5 (original C1, C4, C3):** These chiral centers are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are retained.\n    *   Original `(1R)` remains **(1R)**.\n    *   Original `(4R)` remains **(4R)**.\n    *   Original `(3R)` becomes **(5R)** after renumbering.\n*   Putting it all together, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   The derived product name and stereochemistry, `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]` system indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` indicates the CH2 of the cyclopropane is replaced by an oxygen, forming an epoxide across the C1-C6 bond of the cyclohexane.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given stereodescriptors are (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to understand the 3D structure this name represents. We can draw a 2D representation of the molecule viewed from the top. The epoxide ring creates a rigid `cis`-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is \"up\" (represented by wedges).\n    *   To satisfy the given R/S assignments, we can deduce the orientation of the substituents:\n        *   **Epoxide:** The C1-O and C6-O bonds are \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   **At C1 (1R):** The methyl group must be \"down\" (dash).\n        *   **At C6 (6S):** The hydrogen atom must be \"down\" (dash).\n        *   **At C3 (3R):** The methyl group must be \"down\" (dash), and the hydrogen \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   **At C4 (4R):** The methyl group must be \"down\" (dash), and the hydrogen \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The epoxide is reacted with `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent), followed by a proton source (implied workup).\n*   **Mechanism:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that open epoxides via an SN2-like mechanism. Key rules for this reaction are:\n    1.  The nucleophile (in this case, `Me-`) attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon.\n    3.  The attack happens from the side opposite to the C-O bond, leading to **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    4.  The resulting alkoxide is protonated during workup to form an alcohol (-OH).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n\n*   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6. The nucleophile `Me-` can attack either carbon.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group.\n*   **C6** is substituted with only a hydrogen atom.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The `Me-` nucleophile attacks C6 from the \"down\" side (anti to the \"up\" C6-O bond). This causes the C6-O bond to break and results in an inversion of configuration at C6.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The original configuration at C6 was (S). Inversion leads to an (R) configuration at this carbon. The original H atom at C6 was \"down\", so it becomes \"up\". The new methyl group is added to the \"down\" position.\n*   **Formation of Alcohol at C1:** The C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks, with the electrons moving to the oxygen, forming an alkoxide. This alkoxide is then protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not inverted because the bond broken is C1-O, not a bond to a substituent on the chiral center itself. The new C1-OH bond will be in the same position as the original C1-O bond, i.e., \"up\".\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their spatial arrangement of atoms is preserved.\n\n**5. Name the Product and Verify Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group at the original C1 position.\n    *   A new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n    *   The original methyl groups at the C3 and C4 positions.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. To give the substituents the lowest locant set, we number the ring clockwise from the new C1.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   New C2 = Old C6\n    *   New C3 = Old C5\n    *   New C4 = Old C4\n    *   New C5 = Old C3\n    *   New C6 = Old C2\n    The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Final Stereochemistry Determination (Logical Transformation):** We can determine the configuration of each stereocenter in the product by considering how it's transformed from the starting material.\n    *   **Product C1:** Corresponds to reactant C1. The configuration is preserved. Reactant C1 is (R), so product C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Product C2:** Corresponds to reactant C6. The configuration is inverted. Reactant C6 is (S), so product C2 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Product C4:** Corresponds to reactant C4. The configuration is preserved. Reactant C4 is (R), so product C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Product C5:** Corresponds to reactant C3. The configuration is preserved. Reactant C3 is (R), so product C5 is **(R)**.\n    *(Note: Preservation of configuration (e.g., R -> R) holds because the relative CIP priorities of the substituents around the chiral center do not change upon renumbering the ring for the product.)*\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe reaction in question is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me₂CuLi). To determine the correct product, we must apply the established rules for this type of reaction regarding regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### **1. Regioselectivity: Site of Attack**\n\nOrganocuprates are soft nucleophiles that react with epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. A key principle of these reactions is that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a tertiary center, as it is bonded to three other carbon atoms (C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is a secondary center, bonded to two other carbon atoms (C1 and C5).\n\nGiven the lower steric hindrance at C6, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from the Gilman reagent will selectively attack this position. This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\nThis regioselectivity leads to a product with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the original C1, and a new methyl group on the original C6. The resulting skeleton is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options C and D, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1 position.\n\n### **2. Stereoselectivity: Inversion of Configuration**\n\nThe Sₙ2-like mechanism of epoxide opening by organocuprates involves a backside attack by the nucleophile, which results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at carbon C6.\n*   The problem states that the initial configuration of C6 is (S).\n*   The reaction causes an inversion of this configuration. Therefore, the resulting stereocenter at this position will have an (R) configuration.\n\n### **3. Product Structure and IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\nWe must now determine the IUPAC name for the resulting stereoisomer.\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the original C1) is designated as C1 in the final product.\n*   The numbering of the cyclohexane ring proceeds to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The next substituent is the newly added methyl group at the adjacent carbon (the original C6), so this becomes C2.\n*   The stereocenter that was attacked (original C6) is now C2 in the product.\n*   Since the configuration at C6 inverted from (S) to (R), the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\nLooking at the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOnly option A has the required (2R) configuration at the C2 position. The other stereocenters, (1R, 4R, 5R), are consistent with the original reactant's stereochemistry, as they are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe reaction involves the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate (Gilman reagent). To determine the product, we must consider the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n    *   The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**:\n    *   The user prompt correctly states that when saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group attached, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**, the less hindered position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure**:\n    *   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an acidic workup step (which is standard procedure).\n    *   A new methyl group is added to C6.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions C1, C3, C4, and the new one at C6.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the primary functional group (the -OH) receives the lowest possible number, so it is designated as the new C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants.\n        *   Old C1 (with OH and Me) becomes New C1.\n        *   Old C6 (with the new Me) becomes New C2.\n        *   Old C5 becomes New C3.\n        *   Old C4 (with a Me) becomes New C4.\n        *   Old C3 (with a Me) becomes New C5.\n    *   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This structural name eliminates options B and D, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The prompt also correctly states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n        *   The configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C3 remains **R**. In the final product name, this corresponds to C5, so C5 is **R**.\n    *   The reaction occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **S**. Due to the Sₙ2 attack, this center undergoes inversion.\n    *   In most cases, a geometric inversion of a chiral center leads to an inversion of its Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) descriptor. While exceptions exist if the substituent priorities change in a specific way, the general rule is that inversion means S becomes R and R becomes S.\n    *   Applying this rule, the S configuration at C6 inverts to an **R** configuration at the corresponding carbon in the product (which is the new C2).\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. The fusion is `cis`. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen points \"up\" (beta face).\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4. A hydrogen is at C6.\n*   **Stereochemistry from the name:**\n    *   The problem provides the absolute configuration of all stereocenters. We don't need to determine them from scratch, but we must use them to understand the reaction's outcome. The key stereocenters for the reaction are the epoxide carbons: C1 (R) and C6 (S).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon where the nucleophile adds. This is a characteristic Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon center (bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon center (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more sterically hindered than C6 due to the presence of the methyl group.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Numbering**\n\n*   The Me⁻ attacks C6, and the C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after protonation during workup, becomes an -OH group.\n*   The original cyclohexane C-C framework remains intact.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. It has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6. The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring from C1 towards the original C6.\n    *   Product C1 = Reactant C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   Product C2 = Reactant C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   Product C3 = Reactant C5\n    *   Product C4 = Reactant C4 (has -Me)\n    *   Product C5 = Reactant C3 (has -Me)\n    *   Product C6 = Reactant C2\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2-dimethyl implies attack at C1).\n\n**5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Untouched Centers:** The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 of the reactant are not involved in the bond-breaking/forming part of the reaction. Their configurations are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 is (R) → Product C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   Reactant C4 is (R) → Product C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   Reactant C3 is (R) → Product C5 is **(R)**.\n*   **Center of Attack:** The stereocenter at C6 undergoes Sₙ2 attack, leading to **inversion of configuration**.\n    *   Reactant C6 has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   The attack by Me⁻ inverts the stereocenter. We need to determine if the resulting configuration at product C2 is R or S.\n    *   This is not a simple S → R flip because the substituents, and thus their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities, change. The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, and the incoming group is methyl.\n    *   Let's analyze the transformation. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the face opposite the C6-O bond. This is an `anti` attack. The original substituent at C6 (a hydrogen) and the other ring connections are pushed to the opposite side (a Walden inversion).\n    *   Given the starting configuration C6(S), a rigorous analysis of the geometry before and after inversion (considering the change in CIP priorities where O is replaced by Me) shows that the new stereocenter at C2 in the product has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   [Detailed check: Priorities at C6(reactant): O > C1 > C5 > H. With a standard representation, C6(S) means H is anti to the C6-O bond. After inversion, the new Me group takes this anti position, and H moves. Priorities at C2(product): C1 > C5 > Me > H. The inverted geometry with the new priority order results in an (S) assignment.]\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   Combining the stereochemical results:\n    *   C1 is (R)\n    *   C2 is (S)\n    *   C4 is (R)\n    *   C5 is (R)\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent, R₂CuLi) is a well-established method for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **Epoxide:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide bridge connects carbons C1 and C6. C1 has a methyl substituent, while C6 has a hydrogen.\n    *   **Organocuprate:** Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are sterically sensitive nucleophiles. The provided information and general principles of organic chemistry state that the nucleophile will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent will attack at this position.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction. This has two important stereochemical consequences:\n    *   **Inversion of Configuration:** The stereocenter at the site of attack undergoes an inversion of its configuration. The starting material has an (S) configuration at C6. The backside attack will invert this center to an (R) configuration in the product.\n    *   **Retention of Configuration:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their original configuration. Thus, the configurations at C1 (1R), C3 (3R), and C4 (4R) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Substitution Pattern:** The nucleophilic attack of a methyl group at C6 of the bicycloheptane ring opens the epoxide. The C6-O bond breaks, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This results in a cyclohexanol derivative with the following substituents based on the original ring numbering:\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group on C1.\n    *   A new methyl group on C6.\n    *   A methyl group on C3.\n    *   A methyl group on C4.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** To name the final product, the ring is renumbered according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols.\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group receives the highest priority and is designated C1 of the product. This corresponds to C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants. Numbering from C1 (original) towards C6 (original) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This numbering scheme {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than the alternative {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Therefore, the product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n3.  **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** Configuration is retained from the reactant (1R). So, the product is (1R).\n    *   **C2:** This is the original C6. The configuration is inverted from (6S) to (R). So, the product is (2R).\n    *   **C4:** This is the original C4. The configuration is retained (4R). So, the product is (4R).\n    *   **C5:** This is the original C3. The configuration is retained (3R). So, the product is (5R).\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is also substituted with a methyl group.\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion ('Me⁻').\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The reaction is a nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and undergo SN2-type reactions.\n*   The key rule for this reaction is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, Oxygen, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, Oxygen, and a hydrogen).\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**. The C6-O bond will break, and the C1-O bond will cleave to form an alcohol at C1 after acidic workup.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The attack follows an **SN2 mechanism**, which means it proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The attack of the methyl group occurs at C6 from the side opposite the epoxide's oxygen atom.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **S**. Due to the SN2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become **R**.\n*   The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged (**3R** and **4R**).\n*   The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds attached directly to the C1 chiral center are broken. Thus, the configuration at C1 is retained as **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring, resulting in a cyclohexanol derivative.\n*   The substituents on the product ring are:\n    *   An -OH group and a -Me group at the original C1.\n    *   A new -Me group (from the cuprate) at the original C6.\n    *   The original -Me groups at C3 and C4.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the ring. The carbon with the -OH group is assigned as C1. To give the other methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring clockwise.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Old C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Old C5\n    *   New C4 = Old C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Old C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Old C2\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the Absolute Configurations to the Product**\n*   We map the configurations from our analysis onto the new numbering system:\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6): Configuration is inverted from S to **R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

The carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6. The cyclohexane ring provides the rest of the bicyclic system.\n*   We need to determine the stereochemistry of all chiral centers based on the given name. We can draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring to assign the stereochemistry using wedge (up, β) and dash (down, α) bonds.\n\nLet's assign the stereochemistry for each center:\n1.  **C6 (6S):** C6 is part of the epoxide. The groups are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, -H. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. To have an 'S' configuration, we must place the lowest priority group (H) in a way that the sequence O → C1 → C5 is counter-clockwise (or clockwise if H is pointing towards the viewer). If we assume the epoxide oxygen is **down (dash)**, the hydrogen at C6 must be **up (wedge)**. Viewing with H pointing towards us, the sequence O → C1 → C5 is clockwise, which correctly gives an S configuration. So, the epoxide is on the α-face (down).\n2.  **C1 (1R):** C1 has a methyl group. The groups are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, -CH₃. The CIP priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH₃. The oxygen is down (dash). To get an R configuration, with the lowest priority group (CH₃) in the back (down, dash), the sequence O → C6 → C2 must be clockwise. This is the case. Therefore, the methyl group at C1 is **down (dash, α)**.\n3.  **C4 (4R):** C4 has a methyl group. The priorities are C3 > C5 > CH₃ > H (C3 is higher priority than C5 because C3 will be attached to a methyl group). To have an R configuration, with H in the back (down, dash), the sequence C3 → C5 → CH₃ must be clockwise. This is achieved if the methyl group is **up (wedge, β)**.\n4.  **C3 (3R):** C3 has a methyl group. The priorities are C4 > C2 > CH₃ > H (C4 is higher priority than C2 because C4 has a methyl group). To have an R configuration, with H in the back (down, dash), the sequence C4 → C2 → CH₃ must be clockwise. This is achieved if the methyl group is **up (wedge, β)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide: down (α)\n*   1-Methyl: down (α)\n*   3-Methyl: up (β)\n*   4-Methyl: up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of attack.**\n*   The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the \"soft\" nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and two ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a hydrogen and two ring carbons.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at this position.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the reaction.**\n*   The reaction is an Sɴ2-type ring opening. The problem states that **inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added**.\n*   The C6-O bond of the epoxide is pointing **down (α)**.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the opposite side, which is the **up (β) face**.\n*   The original stereocenter at C6 had a configuration of **S**. Due to the inversion, the new stereocenter at C6 in the product will have an **R** configuration.\n*   The attack opens the ring by breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is unchanged, as are the stereocenters at C3 and C4.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\nLet's assemble the product structure based on the analysis:\n*   A cyclohexane ring is formed.\n*   At C1 (original numbering): An -OH group pointing down (α) and a -CH₃ group pointing down (α). The configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   At C6 (original numbering): The new methyl group from the cuprate is pointing **up (β)**. The original hydrogen is pushed down (α). The configuration has inverted from S to **R**.\n*   At C3 (original numbering): The methyl group remains **up (β)**. The configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   At C4 (original numbering): The methyl group remains **up (β)**. The configuration is retained as **R**.\n\nNow, we need to name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the parent name is **cyclohexanol**. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring starting from C1 to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Let's check the two possible numbering directions from our C1 (the original C1).\n    *   Numbering clockwise (C1 → original C2 → original C3...): The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1,3,4,6}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise (C1 → original C6 → original C5...): The methyl groups are at C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3). The locant set is {1,2,4,5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1,3,4,6} and {1,2,4,5}, the latter is lower. So, the correct numbering is counter-clockwise.\n3.  **Full Name:** The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to the product.**\nUsing the correct IUPAC numbering (New C1=Old C1, New C2=Old C6, New C4=Old C4, New C5=Old C3):\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **1R** configuration.\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted from S to R. So, the product has a **2R** configuration.\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **4R** configuration.\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **5R** configuration.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the result with the given options.**\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Matches our derived product perfectly.**\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It should be 2R, not 2S.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\n**Detailed Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This name describes a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` part is cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), which is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   As stated in the problem, organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and prefer to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. This is a key principle for regioselectivity.\n    *   The mechanism is an S_N2-type reaction, which means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken. This leads to an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure and Regioselectivity:**\n    *   Let's visualize the epoxide. It's a cyclohexene oxide derivative. The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it has two hydrogens in the parent cyclohexane, one of which is part of the cyclohexane ring skeleton).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. The methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Attack:**\n    *   The attack on C6 follows an S_N2 mechanism, causing an **inversion of configuration** at C6.\n    *   Let's determine the initial configuration of C6. The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-...`. So, C6 has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Due to the S_N2 attack, the stereocenter at C6 will invert. An (S) center will become an (R) center (assuming the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities of the substituents don't change in a way that would retain the S descriptor despite geometric inversion, which is unlikely here).\n    *   The C-O bond at C6 is broken, and a new C-C bond is formed with the incoming methyl group. The C-O bond at C1 is also cleaved, and upon acidic workup (implied in these reactions), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is opened at the C6-O bond.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   An -OH group is formed at C1.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n6.  **Name the Product and Determine Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **Numbering:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon it is attached to (the original C1) is the new C1. To get the lowest locants for the methyl groups, we number the ring counter-clockwise: C1 -> C6(old) -> C5(old) -> C4(old) -> C3(old).\n        *   The methyls are at C1 (original), C2 (newly added), C4 (original), and C5 (from original C3).\n        *   The product is a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This eliminates options B and D.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:**\n        *   The configuration at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) is retained.\n        *   The configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n        *   Let's translate the old configurations to the new numbering:\n            *   Original C1 (1R) -> New C1. Configuration is **(1R)**.\n            *   Original C6 (6S) -> New C2. Configuration inverts to **(2R)**.\n            *   Original C4 (4R) -> New C4. Configuration is **(4R)**.\n            *   Original C3 (3R) -> New C5. Configuration is **(5R)**.\n        *   The complete stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)**.\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   The product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Based on established principles of reactivity, we can determine the resulting product by following a logical sequence of steps.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism:**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The given R/S descriptors define its specific three-dimensional structure.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon atom. In the given bicyclic system, the epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms), making it highly hindered. C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three non-hydrogen atoms and one hydrogen), which is significantly less hindered. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism, which results in a \"backside attack\". This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the carbon-oxygen bond, leading to an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Course of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting material has an S configuration at C6. Due to the Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile, this center will undergo inversion, resulting in an R configuration in the product.\n*   **Retention at Other Centers:** The reaction does not involve breaking or forming bonds at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4). Therefore, their absolute configurations remain unchanged. C1 stays R, C3 stays R, and C4 stays R. Note that while the 3D arrangement at C1 is unchanged, its R/S descriptor could theoretically change if the priority of its neighboring groups changes. However, a detailed analysis shows the priority order of the substituents around C1 does not change, thus it remains R.\n\n**3. Structure and Nomenclature of the Product:**\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond, opening the epoxide ring. Subsequent protonation (assumed in the workup step) of the resulting alkoxide at C1 yields a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Renaming:** The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered towards the newly added methyl group. This leads to the following correspondence between the old and new numbering:\n    *   Old C1 → New C1 (has -OH and a methyl group)\n    *   Old C6 → New C2 (has the newly added methyl group)\n    *   Old C4 → New C4 (has a methyl group)\n    *   Old C3 → New C5 (has a methyl group)\n*   **Final Product Name:** Based on the retention and inversion of stereocenters, the product's configuration is:\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1) remains **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6) inverts from S to **R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4) remains **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3) remains **R**.\n\nCombining these elements, the final product is identified as **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe analysis of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi) is based on well-established principles of organocuprate chemistry.\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type**: The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group. Gilman reagents are known to react with epoxides in a ring-opening reaction that forms a new carbon-carbon bond. This reaction is mechanistically similar to an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt and chemical literature confirm that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of an unsymmetrical epoxide. In the given bicyclic epoxide, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 bears a methyl group, making it a more substituted and sterically hindered position. C6, while part of the bicyclic system, does not have an additional alkyl substituent. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond. This backside attack results in an inversion of the configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration. The inversion of configuration will change it to (R).\n    *   The configuration at C1, which is (R), is not attacked and remains unchanged. This carbon will bear the resulting hydroxyl group.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters, C3 (R) and C4 (R), are also unaffected by the reaction.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after workup (which is implied), an alcohol is formed at C1.\n    *   The original cyclohexane ring now has four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the hydroxyl group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 remains C1 in the product.\n    *   The carbon that was attacked (C6) is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2. The other carbons are numbered around the ring. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   The final product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **C1**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (1R, ...).\n    *   **C2 (from C6)**: Undergoes inversion from (S) to (R). The product is (..., 2R, ...).\n    *   **C4 (from C4)**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (..., 4R, ...).\n    *   **C5 (from C3)**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (..., 5R).\n\nCombining these determines the final product's stereochemistry as (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R). This corresponds to option D.\n\nTherefore, the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me₂CuLi yields (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), with an epoxide is a cornerstone of organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereochemistry of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three other carbons and an oxygen), and it bears a methyl group. C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to two other carbons and an oxygen).\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, in this case, a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In this molecule, C6 is a secondary carbon, while C1 is a tertiary carbon with a methyl group. Therefore, C6 is the less hindered site, and it is where the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction proceeds through a backside attack, characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction. This results in the inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked. The configurations of the other stereocenters in the molecule, which are not directly involved in the ring-opening, are retained.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n1.  **Site of Attack:** The incoming methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered C6 of the epoxide.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The attack breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (an implicit step to neutralize the intermediate), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The stereocenter at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material, undergoes inversion to become (R) in the product.\n    *   The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not part of the reaction and retain their original configurations: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:**\n    *   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The hydroxyl group is on C1 (from the reactant), which also has a methyl group. The newly added methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, C2 (originally C6). The other original methyl groups are now at positions C4 and C5 based on standard IUPAC numbering for the cyclohexanol product.\n    *   The final structure is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   Let's map the stereochemistry to the new name:\n        *   **C1:** Retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   **C2 (from C6):** Inverts from (S) to (R).\n        *   **C4 (from C4):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   **C5 (from C3):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the full IUPAC name of the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1.

The numbers [4.1.0] indicate that the bridgehead carbons (let's call them C1 and C6) are connected by a path of 4 carbons (C2-C3-C4-C5), a path of 1 carbon (which is actually the other side of the epoxide, but this notation means a 3-membered ring is fused to a 6-membered ring), and a bridge of 0 atoms. The `7-oxa` means atom 7, which is part of the three-membered ring, is an oxygen.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\n*   **Drawing the structure:** We can represent the cyclohexane ring as a planar hexagon with wedges (bonds coming out of the plane, up/beta) and dashes (bonds going into the plane, down/alpha) to show the 3D arrangement.\n    *   From the stereodescriptors (1R, 6S), we can deduce that the epoxide ring and the substituents on the bridgehead carbons (C1-Me and C6-H) are on opposite faces of the cyclohexane ring. We will place the bulky epoxide ring 'up' (beta, wedge). This forces the C1-Me group and the C6-H to be 'down' (alpha, dash).\n    *   For C3 to be R (3R) and C4 to be R (4R), with their respective hydrogens in the back (alpha/dash), the methyl groups at C3 and C4 must both be 'up' (beta, wedge).\n\n*   **Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:**\n    *   Epoxide ring: up (beta, wedged bonds from C1 and C6 to O).\n    *   Methyl group at C1: down (alpha, dashed bond).\n    *   Hydrogen at C6: down (alpha, dashed bond).\n    *   Methyl group at C3: up (beta, wedged bond).\n    *   Methyl group at C4: up (beta, wedged bond).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n*   **Key Principles (as stated in the problem):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **Hindrance at C1:** C1 is a *quaternary* carbon, bonded to a methyl group in addition to the three ring carbons (C2, C6, O). Backside attack (required for Sₙ2) on the C1-O bond would have to come from the 'down' (alpha) face, which is sterically blocked by the axial-like methyl group at C1.\n*   **Hindrance at C6:** C6 is a *tertiary* carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom. Backside attack on the C6-O bond would also come from the 'down' (alpha) face, where it would encounter the axial-like hydrogen at C6.\n*   **Conclusion:** A hydrogen atom is much smaller than a methyl group. Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and it will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Attack:** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6 from the 'down' (alpha) face.\n*   **Bond breaking/formation:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains.\n*   **Inversion:** The configuration at C6 is inverted. The original H at C6 (alpha, down) is pushed 'up' (beta). The incoming methyl group attaches to the 'down' (alpha) face of C6.\n*   **Workup:** The resulting alkoxide at C1 is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was 'up', the -OH group will also be 'up' (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product's substituents:**\n    *   At `old C1`: -OH is up (beta), -Me is down (alpha).\n    *   At `old C6`: New -Me is down (alpha), -H is up (beta).\n    *   At `old C3`: -Me is up (beta), -H is down (alpha).\n    *   At `old C4`: -Me is up (beta), -H is down (alpha).\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. We need to number the ring according to IUPAC rules.\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (where `new C2` = `old C6`, `new C4` = `old C4`, `new C5` = `old C3`).\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred over {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   So, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration for the Product:** We now determine the absolute configuration at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. We use the planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down).\n\n    *   **C1:**\n        *   Priorities: -OH (1) > C2 (has Me) > C6 > -Me (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-Me) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence OH → C2 → C6 is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C1 is R**.\n\n    *   **C2 (old C6):**\n        *   Priorities: C1 (has OH) > C3 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'up' (front).\n        *   The sequence C1 → C3 → -Me is **counter-clockwise**.\n        *   Since H is in the front, we reverse the result: counter-clockwise becomes clockwise.\n        *   Therefore, **C2 is R**.\n\n    *   **C4 (old C4):**\n        *   Priorities: C5 (has Me) > C3 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence C5 → C3 → -Me is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C4 is R**.\n\n    *   **C5 (old C3):**\n        *   Priorities: C4 (has Me) > C6 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence C4 → C6 → -Me is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C5 is R**.\n\n*   The final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemistry, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n**1. Understanding the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` means the bridging atom (C7) of the cyclopropane is an oxygen, which makes this an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The molecule has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is explicitly given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Key Principles of the Reaction**\n\nThere are two fundamental rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the epoxide at the carbon atom that is **less sterically hindered**.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-type mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Applying the Principles to the Problem**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide ring consists of carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and is bonded to C2 and C6.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom and is bonded to C1 and C5.\n    *   Comparing the steric hindrance, C6 (bearing a hydrogen) is significantly less hindered than C1 (bearing a methyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the stereochemical outcome (Stereospecificity).**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6 and causes an inversion of its stereochemical configuration.\n    *   The starting material's name tells us that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   Due to the SN2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n        *   Configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   Configuration at C3 remains **(R)**.\n        *   Configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring. Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group (the old C1) is designated as C1 in the final product's IUPAC name.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The nucleophilic methyl group added to the old C6. This carbon is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2.\n        *   New C1 corresponds to Old C1.\n        *   New C2 corresponds to Old C6.\n        *   New C4 corresponds to Old C4.\n        *   New C5 corresponds to Old C3.\n    *   The product is named `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This eliminates options C and D which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the final stereochemistry to the product name.**\n    *   We map the configurations from our analysis onto the new numbering system:\n        *   **C1 (old C1):** Retains its configuration -> **(1R)**\n        *   **C2 (old C6):** Inverts its configuration (S -> R) -> **(2R)**\n        *   **C4 (old C4):** Retains its configuration -> **(4R)**\n        *   **C5 (old C3):** Retains its configuration -> **(5R)**\n    *   Combining these gives the full name of the product: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Our derived name matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups at these positions.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute 3D arrangement.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem states two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure of the Starting Epoxide\n\nLet's visualize the 3D structure from the IUPAC name. The epoxide fusion is cis, so we'll place it on the top (β) face of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **At C1 (R):** For C1 to be (R), the methyl group must be on the bottom (α) face.\n*   **At C6 (S):** For C6 to be (S), the hydrogen must be on the bottom (α) face.\n*   **At C3 (R) and C4 (R):** The methyl groups at these positions are on the top (β) face, on the same side as the epoxide oxygen.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regiochemistry)\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen).\n*   The general rule provided suggests an attack at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n*   **Critically, we must check the given answer choices.** An attack at C6 would place a new methyl group at C6 and form an alcohol at C1, leading to a `1,3,4,6-tetramethylcyclohexanol` product. None of the options (A, B, C, D) have this carbon skeleton.\n*   Options A and C have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` skeleton. A gem-dimethyl (`2,2-`) group can only be formed if the nucleophilic methyl attacks the carbon that already has a methyl group. In our substrate, this is **C1**.\n*   Therefore, we must conclude that the reaction proceeds via attack at the **more hindered carbon, C1**. This is a known exception to the general rule, often occurring when other parts of the molecule (like the β-methyl groups at C3 and C4) make the supposedly \"less hindered\" C6 site inaccessible.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Product from C1 Attack\n\n1.  **Attack:** The nucleophile `Me⁻` attacks C1. The reaction follows Sₙ2 stereochemistry.\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The C1-O bond is \"up\" (β). The attack must come from the opposite side, which is the \"down\" (α) face. The incoming methyl group will therefore add to the α face.\n3.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C6 and, after an aqueous workup, becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C6-O bond was \"up\" (β), the resulting -OH group is also \"up\" (β).\n4.  **Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The original C1 carbon now has two methyl groups: the original α-methyl and the newly added α-methyl.\n    *   The OH group is at the C6 position, pointing up (β).\n    *   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unaffected and remain up (β).\n\n### 5. Name the Product and Determine Its Stereochemistry\n\nWe must re-number the ring according to IUPAC rules, giving the -OH group the highest priority (locant 1).\n\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the OH group (the old C6) becomes the new **C1**. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise. The carbon with the two methyls (the old C1) becomes the new **C2**. The old C3 becomes the new **C4**, and the old C4 becomes the new **C5**. The name is **2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This confirms we are looking for either option A or C.\n\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry of the Chiral Centers (C1, C4, C5):**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C6):** This carbon has an -OH (up, β), an H (down, α), and is attached to C2 (the gem-dimethyl carbon) and C6. Priorities are: OH > C2 > C6 > H. With the lowest priority group (H) pointing away, we trace the path from OH → C2 → C6. This path is **clockwise**. Therefore, the configuration at C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C3):** This center was not involved in the reaction. Its original configuration was **(R)**, and it remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C4):** This center was also not involved in the reaction. Its original configuration was **(R)**, and it remains **(R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product:** The product is **(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived product with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The \"7-oxa\" indicates that the CH₂ group of the cyclopropane (at position 7) is replaced by an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6. These are the two carbons of the epoxide ring that can be attacked.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The problem explicitly states a key rule for this reaction: \"When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   We must determine which one is less hindered.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (in addition to being part of the ring). This makes it a tertiary carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C6 has no substituent other than a hydrogen atom (and being part of the ring). This makes it a secondary carbon of the epoxide.\n*   Comparing a tertiary carbon (C1) to a secondary carbon (C6), C6 is clearly the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\n*   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs from the backside of the C-O bond.\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the stereocenter at C6 will undergo inversion. The initial configuration is 6S, so the product will have an R configuration at this carbon.\n*   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-making or bond-breaking (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their relative spatial arrangement. We assume their absolute configuration R/S designation will also be retained, but we will verify this later if needed.\n\n**4. Predict the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Reaction Path:**\n    1.  The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6.\n    2.  The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom.\n    3.  This opens the epoxide ring, forming a lithium alkoxide where the oxygen is still attached to C1.\n    4.  A subsequent workup step (implied, usually with water) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   **Resulting Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n    *   At the position of original C1: one -OH group and one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C3: one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C4: one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C6: the newly added -Me group.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) receives the lowest possible number, which is **C1**.\n    2.  We number the rest of the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Starting at the new C1 and numbering clockwise towards the original C6 position: Me groups are at C1, C2 (from old C6), C4 (from old C4), and C5 (from old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Starting at the new C1 and numbering counter-clockwise towards the original C2 position: Me groups are at C1, C3 (from old C3), C4 (from old C4), and C6 (from old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the two sets {1,2,4,5} and {1,3,4,6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). So, the correct numbering gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the naming in options A and D.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   We need to find the configuration (R or S) of the chiral centers in the product: new C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   We trace the configuration from the reactant to the product based on the numbering we just established:\n    *   **New C2 comes from old C6:** The reaction at this center causes inversion of configuration. Reactant C6 is S, so product C2 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C1 comes from old C1:** This center is not attacked, so its 3D arrangement is preserved. The R/S designation depends on substituent priorities. In both reactant (C1 bonded to O, C6, C2, Me) and product (C1 bonded to OH, C2, C6, Me), the priority order of the four groups remains the same (O/OH > C-neighbor with more Me > C-neighbor with fewer Me > Me). Therefore, the configuration is retained. Reactant C1 is R, so product C1 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C4 comes from old C4:** This center is remote from the reaction site. Its configuration is retained. Reactant C4 is R, so product C4 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C5 comes from old C3:** This center is also remote. Its configuration is retained. Reactant C3 is R, so product C5 will be **R**.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry:** Combining these findings, the product has the configuration (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Based on the established principles of such reactions, two key rules apply:\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down the transformation step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Identify the epoxide carbons and determine the site of attack**: The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" indicates a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused at positions C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Determine the stereochemical outcome**:\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (6S) as given in the name.\n    *   Due to the SN2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted. Thus, the S configuration becomes R.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction, as no bonds are broken or formed at these positions.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure and IUPAC name of the product**:\n    *   The nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide. Subsequent workup with water protonates the resulting alkoxide at C1, forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group receives the highest priority and is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The adjacent carbon, which was attacked (originally C6), is now C2.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n4.  **Assign the stereochemistry to the product**:\n    *   **C1**: The configuration is retained from the starting material. Original C1 was (1R), so the product is (1R).\n    *   **C2**: This was originally C6. Its configuration inverts from (6S) to (2R).\n    *   **C4**: This was originally C3. Its configuration is retained as (3R), which corresponds to (4R) in the new numbering system.\n    *   **C5**: This was originally C4. Its configuration is retained as (4R), which corresponds to (5R) in the new numbering system.\n\nCombining these assignments gives the full name of the product as **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe user has provided a specific chemical reaction and asked to identify the product from a list of options.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic epoxide. The core structure is a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. C1 is also substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary center. C6 is a tertiary center. The stereochemistry of the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is specified.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate). This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The problem statement correctly notes that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Comparing the two epoxide carbons, C1 is more hindered (quaternary, substituted with a methyl group and part of two rings) than C6 (tertiary, part of two rings). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack of Me⁻ occurs at C6.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens, and upon acidic workup (which is standard for these reactions), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexane ring will be:\n        *   At the original C1 position: a hydroxyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C3 position: a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C4 position: a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C6 position: a new methyl group from the Gilman reagent.\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) is designated as **new C1**.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the new C1, and at positions corresponding to the original C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Let's trace the numbering from the new C1.\n        *   Path A (going toward original C2): Substituents at new C1(Me), new C3(Me, from original C3), new C4(Me, from original C4), and new C6(Me, from original C6). This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Path B (going toward original C6): Substituents at new C1(Me), new C2(Me, from original C6), new C4(Me, from original C4), and new C5(Me, from original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1, 3, 4, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5}, the latter is lower according to IUPAC rules.\n    *   Therefore, the product's systematic name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The configurations of the stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction remain unchanged. The center that is attacked undergoes inversion.\n    *   Original stereochemistry: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n    *   Let's map the old centers to the new numbering ({1,2,4,5} pattern):\n        *   **New C1** corresponds to **Original C1**. Its configuration is retained. So, it remains **R**. Product has (1R).\n        *   **New C2** corresponds to **Original C6**. This carbon was attacked, so its configuration inverts. It was S, so it becomes **R**. Product has (2R).\n        *   **New C4** corresponds to **Original C4**. Its configuration is retained. So, it remains **R**. Product has (4R).\n        *   **New C5** corresponds to **Original C3**. Its configuration is retained. So, it remains **R**. Product has (5R).\n    *   Combining these, the final product's stereochemistry is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi).\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, a Gilman reagent (an organocuprate). This provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that are well-suited for this type of reaction.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity\nThe first rule to consider is where the nucleophile will attack.\n*   For reactions with organocuprates and other strong, unhindered nucleophiles under basic or neutral conditions, the attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a classic Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and two other ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n*   **C6** is a secondary carbon, bonded to two other ring carbons (C1 and C5) and a hydrogen.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry\nThe second rule to consider is the stereochemical outcome of the attack.\n*   The ring-opening of epoxides via an Sₙ2 mechanism involves a backside attack. This means the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group at C6 will invert this center to an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The C-O bond at C1 will open and, after an aqueous workup, will form an alcohol (-OH). The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Product Structure\nBased on the analysis above, the resulting product will be a cyclohexanol with the following features:\n*   **Original C1:** Retains its (R) configuration and now has both a methyl group and a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Original C6:** Is now bonded to a new methyl group and its configuration has inverted from (S) to (R).\n*   **Original C3:** Retains its (R) configuration and methyl group.\n*   **Original C4:** Retains its (R) configuration and methyl group.\n\n### 5. Name the Final Product\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the cyclohexane ring:\n1.  The hydroxyl group (-OH) gets the highest priority, so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) becomes the new **C1**.\n2.  We number the ring to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from new C1 (towards original C2) would place methyl groups at 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from new C1 (towards original C6) places the methyl groups at 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n3.  The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering.\n4.  The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nNow, let's assign the absolute configurations based on the new numbering:\n*   **New C1** (Original C1): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (Original C6): Configuration inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (Original C4): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (Original C3): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n\nCombining the stereodescriptors and the name, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bicyclo numbering scheme means the epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6, which are adjacent in the ring. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" means there are methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   \"(1R,3R,4R,6S)\" specifies the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, \"Me⁻\".\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction Rules to the Specific Substrate**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the resulting structure.**\n    *   Attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The C-O bond at C1 breaks, and upon workup, the oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups were at C1, C3, and C4. A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n    *   To name the product, we use IUPAC nomenclature. The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Following the numbering to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants, the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern that would result from attack at C1.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the product's stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity).**\n    *   The reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the point of attack (C6).\n    *   The starting material's stereochemistry at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) center produces an **(R)** center.\n    *   The configuration at the other epoxide carbon (C1) is **retained**. The starting material is **(1R)**, so this center remains **(1R)** in the product.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C3 and C4) which are not part of the reaction are also retained.\n    *   In the IUPAC name of the product, the original C6 is now C2. So, the product must have a **(2R)** configuration. The original C1 is now C1, so it is **(1R)**.\n    *   We are looking for the product: **(1R, 2R, ...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur analysis shows that the product must have a (2R) configuration due to the inversion at the original (6S) carbon. Option A matches this requirement. Option B would imply retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this reaction. The remote stereocenters (4R, 5R) are also consistent with retention of configuration from the starting material (after renumbering).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe reaction in question involves the opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate, specifically lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), which is also known as a Gilman reagent. To determine the correct product, we must follow the established rules for this type of reaction regarding regioselectivity and stereochemistry, which were also helpfully provided in the problem description.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and O), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to H, C1, C5, and O).\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent). This reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt and general chemical principles state that organocuprates attack the *less sterically hindered* carbon of the epoxide ring. Comparing the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 (tertiary) and C6 (secondary), the C6 position is less hindered. Therefore, the methyl group from the Gilman reagent will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *inversion of configuration* at the carbon being attacked. The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their original configuration.\n    *   **At C6**: The initial configuration is S. The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an R configuration.\n    *   **At C1**: This stereocenter's configuration is R. The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds directly to the chiral carbon C1 are formed or broken in a way that would invert its stereochemistry. Thus, it retains its R configuration. The oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an acidic workup step.\n    *   **At C3 and C4**: These stereocenters are remote from the reaction site and their R configurations will not change.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, we have a new molecule with the following features based on the *original numbering* of the bicyclic system:\n*   An -OH group at C1.\n*   A methyl group at C1 (original).\n*   A methyl group at C3 (original).\n*   A methyl group at C4 (original).\n*   A new methyl group at C6.\n\nTo assign the correct IUPAC name, the resulting cyclohexanol must be re-numbered according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  The carbon bearing the highest priority functional group, the hydroxyl (-OH) group, is assigned as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n2.  The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. We have methyl groups at the new C1 (old C1), old C6, old C3, and old C4.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl substituents at positions 1, 2 (from old C6), 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so this numbering is correct.\n\nThe product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Determining the Product's Stereochemistry\n\nNow, we map the stereochemical configurations to the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (Old C1): Retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **New C2** (Old C6): Inverts from S to **R**.\n*   **New C4** (Old C4): Retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **New C5** (Old C3): Retains its **R** configuration.\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: I will identify the structure of the starting epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and the reagent, Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism**: I will apply the known principles for the reaction of epoxides with organocuprates. The user's prompt correctly states that this is an SN2-like reaction where the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, causing an inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n3.  **Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**: The epoxide is formed across carbons C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane system. I will compare the substitution at these two carbons. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not (it has a hydrogen atom). Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon and will be the site of nucleophilic attack by the methyl group from the Gilman reagent.\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The attack on C6 will proceed with inversion of stereochemistry. The initial configuration at C6 is given as (6S). After inversion, the configuration at this carbon will become R.\n    *   The stereochemical centers not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n5.  **Construct the Product**: I will assemble the final product structure and its stereochemistry based on the analysis.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide becomes a C1-OH group. Its configuration remains (1R).\n    *   The new methyl group attaches to C6, which becomes a stereocenter. Its configuration is inverted from (6S) to R.\n    *   The methyl group at C3 retains its (3R) configuration.\n    *   The methyl group at C4 retains its (4R) configuration.\n6.  **Name the Product**: I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the product, which is a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is numbered C1. The numbering will proceed around the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants. Then, I will assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each stereocenter in the product according to the new numbering.\n    *   Original C1 -> New C1 (retains R config) -> **1R**\n    *   Original C6 -> New C2 (inverts from S to R) -> **2R**\n    *   Original C4 -> New C4 (retains R config) -> **4R**\n    *   Original C3 -> New C5 (retains R config) -> **5R**\n7.  **Select the Correct Answer**: The resulting product will have the stereochemistry (1R,2R,4R,5R).

The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes this framework.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations at the chiral centers are given: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S. We can visualize this with the epoxide ring situated on the \"top\" (beta or wedged) face of the cyclohexane ring. The specific configurations of the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are determined by the given R/S assignments. For this analysis, it is sufficient to know their configurations without drawing the exact conformation, as we will rely on the rules of the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\nThe reagent is Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), also known as a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Nucleophile:** This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction with Epoxides:** Organocuprates react with epoxides in an SN2-type nucleophilic substitution reaction to open the epoxide ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\nThe question states a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6, and the oxygen atom.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system. It is a tertiary carbon center (within the hydrocarbon skeleton) and quaternary overall.\n    *   C6 is substituted only with a hydrogen atom (and is part of the ring system). It is a secondary carbon center (within the hydrocarbon skeleton) and tertiary overall.\n*   **Conclusion:** C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) will attack C6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\nThe question provides another key rule: \"In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This is a characteristic feature of an SN2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (which is the epoxide oxygen).\n*   The attack occurs at C6. The original configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the SN2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted. So, the new configuration at this carbon in the product will be (R).\n*   The bonds at the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not broken during this reaction. Therefore, their configurations are retained.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Product Structure and Name**\n*   **Reaction Summary:**\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6, causing inversion from S to R.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide becomes a C1-OH bond after acidic or aqueous workup.\n    *   The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain R.\n*   **Resulting Configurations:**\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C1: Configuration remains **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C6: Configuration inverts from S to **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C3: Configuration remains **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C4: Configuration remains **R**.\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group is assigned as C1 for IUPAC naming. This corresponds to the *original* C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The substituents are now four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group. The methyl groups are on the carbons corresponding to original C1, original C3, original C4, and a new one on original C6.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring starting from the C-OH carbon. We have two choices: clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n        *   If we number clockwise: Methyls would be at 1, original C2 (no Me), original C3, original C4, original C5 (no Me), original C6. Locants: 1, 3, 4, 6.\n        *   If we number counter-clockwise: Methyls would be at 1, original C6, original C5 (no Me), original C4, original C3. Locants: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The set (1, 2, 4, 5) is lower than (1, 3, 4, 6). Thus, the correct IUPAC numbering is counter-clockwise.\n    *   The product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Assigning Stereochemistry to the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   New C1 (was original C1): Configuration is **R**. -> (1R)\n    *   New C2 (was original C6): Configuration is **R**. -> (2R)\n    *   New C4 (was original C4): Configuration is **R**. -> (4R)\n    *   New C5 (was original C3): Configuration is **R**. -> (5R)\n*   **Final Product Name:** Combining the name and stereochemistry gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Result with the Options**\nThe calculated product name (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol matches option B.\n\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Correct)\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern)\nD) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern and stereochemistry)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name:\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me-), although it's delivered as part of the cuprate complex.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles, and their reaction with epoxides is primarily governed by sterics. They attack the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   Let's examine the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 and C6:\n        *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being connected to C2 and C6 within the ring and the epoxide oxygen. It is a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogen).\n        *   **C6** is connected to C5 and C1 within the ring, the epoxide oxygen, and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon.\n    *   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more hindered than C6 due to the presence of the methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me-) from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   This backside attack results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   Since the attack is at C6, the stereocenter at C6 will invert its configuration.\n    *   The original configuration of C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   After the reaction, the configuration at this carbon will become **R**.\n    *   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-making steps, so their configurations will be retained.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The attack of Me- on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O-). A subsequent aqueous workup (which is assumed in such problems) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   Let's summarize the changes based on the original numbering:\n        *   An -OH group is now at C1.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C1.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C3.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C4.\n        *   A new methyl group (from the cuprate) is added at C6.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. To name it correctly according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the ring. The carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned as C1. Then, we number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n        *   Let's call the original C1 (now with OH and Me) the \"new C1\".\n        *   The methyl groups are at original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n        *   We can number clockwise (new C1 -> old C2 -> old C3 ...) or counter-clockwise (new C1 -> old C6 -> old C5 ...).\n        *   Numbering counter-clockwise: New C1 (old C1), New C2 (old C6), New C3 (old C5), New C4 (old C4), New C5 (old C3). The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Numbering clockwise: New C1 (old C1), New C2 (old C2), New C3 (old C3). The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Comparing the sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). Thus, the correct numbering gives the locants 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product's Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   We need to find the configuration (R or S) for the chiral centers in the product, which are at C1, C2, C4, and C5 (in the new numbering system).\n    *   We map the original stereocenters to the new ones and apply the changes:\n        *   **New C1** comes from **Old C1**. Configuration is retained. Original was (1R) -> Product is **(1R)**.\n        *   **New C2** comes from **Old C6**. Configuration is inverted. Original was (6S) -> Product is **(2R)**.\n        *   **New C4** comes from **Old C4**. Configuration is retained. Original was (4R) -> Product is **(4R)**.\n        *   **New C5** comes from **Old C3**. Configuration is retained. Original was (3R) -> Product is **(5R)**.\n    *   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe search results confirm the key principles for the reaction of organocuprates (Gilman reagents) with epoxides.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft, nucleophilic reagents that attack epoxides in an SN2 fashion. This attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which leads to an inversion of configuration at the carbon center being attacked. The overall result is a *trans*-diaxial opening when applied to cyclic systems like cyclohexene oxides.\n\nBased on this, the analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate and Reagent**:\n    *   Substrate: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Reagent: Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**:\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center within the epoxide.\n    *   C6 has no methyl group substituent, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   The nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type opening. The methyl nucleophile attacks C6 from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   This results in the inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The initial configuration is (6S), so after inversion, it becomes (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction and are retained.\n    *   The epoxide ring opens, and after workup (which is implicit), the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n4.  **Identify and Name the Product**:\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain. A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   To name the product, the ring must be re-numbered according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols. The carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the set {1, 2, 4, 5}. The former C6 is now C2, former C3 is now C5, and former C4 is now C4.\n    *   The product name is therefore 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n5.  **Assign the Stereochemistry to the Product**:\n    *   Configuration at new C1 (old C1) is retained: **(1R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C2 (old C6) is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C4 (old C4) is retained: **(4R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C5 (old C3) is retained: **(5R)**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis detailed analysis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which has specific consequences for the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of the product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` part of the name indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The oxygen is designated as position 7, and it bridges carbons 1 and 6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4, with the specified R/S configurations.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, or lithium dimethylcuprate. This Gilman reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity of the Reaction:**\nOrganocuprates are considered soft nucleophiles. In reactions with asymmetric epoxides under basic or neutral conditions, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given substrate, the epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, C5, and O7).\n*   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen atom, and O7).\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent will attack at this position.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry of the Reaction:**\nThe reaction proceeds via a backside S_N2 attack. A key characteristic of the S_N2 mechanism is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the substitution occurs.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n*   This causes the C6-O bond to break, and the stereochemical configuration at C6 is inverted.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as (6S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be (R).\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   A new methyl group is added to C6. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated C1. This corresponds to C1 of the reactant. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The nucleophilic attack happened at C6 of the starting material, which becomes C2 in the final product, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereocenters at reactant C3 and C4 are undisturbed and become C5 and C4 in the product, respectively, retaining their 'R' configuration.\n*   The crucial point is the inversion at the site of attack. The C6 carbon of the reactant becomes the C2 carbon of the product, and its configuration inverts from S to R.\n*   Thus, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (1R,2**S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,2**R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOptions C and D have an incorrect substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...). Options A and B have the correct substitution pattern (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl...). The determining factor is the stereochemistry at C2, which must be R due to the inversion of configuration. This eliminates option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bridgehead carbons where the fusion occurs are C1 and C6. The oxygen atom of the epoxide is labeled as atom 7.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to determine the 3D structure. By carefully applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the following structure can be determined:\n    *   The epoxide ring is oriented 'down' (alpha face).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is 'up' (beta face), making it *trans* to the epoxide.\n    *   The hydrogen at C6 is 'up' (beta face), also *trans* to the epoxide.\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is 'up' (beta face).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is 'up' (beta face).\n\nLet's represent this with a 2D drawing with wedges (up) and dashes (down):\n```\n          Me(4, wedge)\n         /\n     --C4(H,dash)--\n    /               \\\n C5(H,H)             C3(H,dash)--Me(3,wedge)\n /                       \\\nC6(H,wedge)-------------C2(H,H)\n \\  (O,dash)   /\n  \\          /\n   C1(Me,wedge)\n     `-. /\n        O\n```\n*Note: This is a complex 3D structure, and its correct assignment is crucial.*\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves backside attack and inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack):** The problem states that the attack occurs at the *less hindered carbon*. Let's examine the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is highly sterically hindered.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a hydrogen, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is significantly less hindered than C1.\n\nBased on the rule provided, the attack should occur at C6. This would lead to a product with a new methyl group at C6 and an OH group at C1. The resulting product would be a **1,3,4,6-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nHowever, none of the options (A, B, C, D) have this substitution pattern. They are either `1,2,4,5-` or `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This strongly suggests that the reaction does not follow the general rule in this specific case, and the attack must occur at the *more hindered* carbon, C1. This type of outcome can happen in complex bicyclic systems or when electronic factors, favoring charge stabilization at the more substituted carbon, override sterics.\n\n**3. The Correct Pathway: Attack at the More Hindered Carbon (C1)**\n\nLet's proceed with the hypothesis that the attack occurs at C1.\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C1.\n*   **Step 2: Stereochemistry of Attack.** The attack is Sₙ2-like. The leaving group is the C1-O bond, which is 'down' (alpha). Therefore, the nucleophile must attack from the 'up' side (beta).\n*   **Step 3: Inversion and Bond Breaking.** The attack from 'up' inverts the configuration at C1, breaking the C1-O bond. The electrons from this bond move to the oxygen atom.\n*   **Step 4: Protonation.** An acid-water workup protonates the resulting alkoxide at C6, forming an alcohol (OH) group.\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\nLet's trace the fate of each part of the molecule.\n\n*   **Numbering Change:** The OH group defines the new C1. So, the old C6 becomes the new C1. The old C1 becomes the new C2, and so on around the ring.\n    *   Reactant C6 → Product C1\n    *   Reactant C1 → Product C2\n    *   Reactant C3 → Product C4\n    *   Reactant C4 → Product C5\n*   **Stereochemistry of Unchanged Centers:**\n    *   The configurations at C3 and C4 are not affected by the reaction. So, Reactant C3(R) becomes Product C4(R), and Reactant C4(R) becomes Product C5(R).\n*   **Stereochemistry at the New OH Carbon (Product C1):**\n    *   This carbon was C6 in the reactant. Its configuration was (6S), with bonds to O(down), H(up), C1, and C5. These bonds (except C6-O) are not broken. The C6-O bond becomes C6-OH. The priorities of the attached groups do not change their order. Therefore, the configuration remains S. The product has a stereocenter at **C1 which is (S)**.\n*   **Stereochemistry at the site of attack (Product C2):**\n    *   This was C1 in the reactant. It had a Me group 'up'. The nucleophilic attack from 'up' inverts the center, pushing the original methyl group 'down'. The carbon is no longer a stereocenter as it becomes a gem-dimethyl group (C(Me)₂).\n*   **Final Product Assembly:**\n    *   The OH group is at C1 (from the 'down' epoxide O at C6).\n    *   The gem-dimethyl group is at C2.\n    *   The Me group at C4 is 'up' (beta).\n    *   The Me group at C5 is 'up' (beta).\n    *   Let's determine the R/S of the final product based on this derived structure.\n        *   **Product C1 (Old C6):** We established its configuration is (S).\n        *   **Product C4 (Old C3):** We established its configuration is (R).\n        *   **Product C5 (Old C4):** We established its configuration is (R).\n    *   So, the predicted product is **(1S, 4R, 5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis prediction does not perfectly match any of the options. Let's reconsider the C1 configuration in the product. While the atom priorities O>C1>C5>H become OH>C2>C6>H, and the order seems preserved, the change from a constrained bicyclic system to a more flexible cyclohexane can alter the 3D arrangement in a way that flips the R/S designation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the product stereochemistry assuming inversion happened, leading to **(1R, 4R, 5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nLet's analyze the reaction that would form this product:\n*   Product Name: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   This name requires that C1 is (R), C4 is (R), and C5 is (R).\n*   The (4R, 5R) part is consistent with our analysis of the spectator centers C3 and C4.\n*   The (1R) requires that the original C6(S) center somehow becomes (R) in the final product. Let's trace this carefully.\n    *   Reactant C1(R) is attacked. Me- attacks from 'up' (beta), opposite to the 'down' (alpha) C1-O bond. Inversion occurs.\n    *   The product has the OH at C1 (from reactant C6). The C6-O bond was 'down', so OH is 'down' (alpha). The C6-H was 'up', so H is 'up' (beta).\n    *   Let's assign the configuration for this new C1 center. Priorities: OH > C2(gem-diMe) > C6(CH2) > H. The lowest priority group (H) is 'up' (wedge). So we trace the path 1->2->3 and reverse the result. Path OH(1,down) -> C2(2, in plane) -> C6(3, in plane) is counter-clockwise. Reversing CCW gives **(R)**.\n    *   So, the configuration at C1 is indeed (R).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pathway involving attack at the more hindered C1 site correctly predicts the stereochemistry of all centers in option A.\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n2.  **Reaction:** Attack of Me⁻ at the more hindered C1, against the general rule but dictated by the available answers.\n3.  **Mechanism:** Sₙ2 attack from the 'up' (beta) face, opposite the 'down' (alpha) C1-O bond.\n4.  **Resulting Product Structure:**\n    *   OH group at the new C1 (old C6) is 'down' (alpha).\n    *   Me groups at C4 and C5 (from old C3 and C4) remain 'up' (beta).\n5.  **Stereochemical Assignment:** This structure corresponds to **(1R, 4R, 5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring (the 7-oxa part). The `[4.1.0]` bridge notation confirms this structure. Let's label the carbons of the cyclohexane ring C1 through C6, with the epoxide linking C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   It is substituted with methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute configurations of the four stereocenters (C1, C3, C4, C6) are given as (1R), (3R), (4R), and (6S), respectively.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate).\n    *   This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe problem provides two key rules for the reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This means the reaction is sterically controlled.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added.\" This indicates an Sₙ2-type mechanism. The nucleophile performs a backside attack on one of the epoxide carbons, breaking the C-O bond.\n\n**3. Apply the Rules to the Specific Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the site of nucleophilic attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The nucleophilic methyl group can attack either C1 or C6 of the epoxide ring.\n    *   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n        *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (`1-methyl...`).\n        *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (since it's not mentioned otherwise and is a stereocenter).\n    *   A methyl group is much larger than a hydrogen atom. Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the product's carbon skeleton.**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, and the epoxide ring opens. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups were at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The original C6, now bearing a new methyl group, is adjacent to the new C1, so it will be numbered C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. We are left with options A and D.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the stereochemistry of the product.**\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the point of attack (C6) and retention of configuration at all other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n    *   The starting configurations are: (1R), (3R), (4R), (6S).\n    *   The configurations of the stereocenters that are not attacked are retained:\n        *   C1 remains (R). In the product, this is **1R**.\n        *   C4 remains (R). In the product, this is **4R**.\n        *   C3 remains (R). In the product, this is C5, and its configuration remains **R**.\n    *   Now, we must determine the configuration of the new stereocenter at C2 (the original C6). The starting configuration at C6 is (S). The Sₙ2 reaction causes an inversion of configuration.\n    *   **Detailed analysis of the inversion at C6:** A simple switch from (S) to (R) is only guaranteed if the substituent priorities do not change order. Here, the leaving group (O, priority #1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, which will have a lower priority than C1 and the other ring carbon). Thus, we must determine the final configuration based on the geometry of the attack.\n        *   The reaction is a backside attack. To determine the stereochemistry, we first need to know the orientation of the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen). The configuration at C6 is (S). The substituents in order of priority are O > C1 > C5 > H. For C6 to be (S), with the lowest priority group (H) pointing away from the viewer (dash/alpha), the path O → C1 → C5 must be counter-clockwise. This means the epoxide oxygen is pointing toward the viewer (wedge/beta).\n        *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the back side, i.e., from the alpha face (dash).\n        *   The inversion at C6 pushes the original H from the alpha face to the beta face (wedge).\n        *   So, in the product, the new stereocenter C2 (original C6) has the new methyl group on the alpha face (dash) and the original hydrogen on the beta face (wedge).\n        *   Let's assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog configuration to this new center (C2). The substituents are C1 (bearing OH and Me), C3 (CH₂), the new Me, and H. The priority order is C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n        *   The lowest priority group (H) is on the beta face (wedge). According to the CIP rules, when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, the configuration is the reverse of what the path indicates.\n        *   Tracing the path from highest to lowest priority (C1 → C3 → Me), we observe a clockwise (CW) direction on the ring.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group (H) is wedge, we reverse the result: CW becomes (S).\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 in the product is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Assemble the final product name.**\n    *   Combining the configurations of all stereocenters in the product: (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   The full IUPAC name is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThis name and configuration match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires a careful application of the rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity for the ring-opening of epoxides with organocuprates (Gilman reagents).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 with the specified stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate). This reagent delivers a methyl nucleophile (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\n1.  Identify the carbons of the epoxide ring: C1 and C6.\n2.  Compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, and C6).\n    *   **C6** is a **secondary** carbon (bonded to a hydrogen, C5, and C1).\n3.  A secondary carbon is less sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The methyl group attacks C6 from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack). This breaks the C6-O bond, and the epoxide ring opens. The oxygen, which remains attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻), and is subsequently protonated during the reaction workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n2.  **Product Skeleton & IUPAC Numbering:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring with four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is given the number 1.\n    *   Thus, the original C1 (with the -OH group) becomes the **new C1**.\n    *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (original C6) becomes the **new C2**.\n    *   The other carbons are renumbered accordingly: original C4 becomes new C4, and original C3 becomes new C5.\n    *   The product has methyl groups at the new C1, C2, C4, and C5 positions. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This structural information eliminates options A and B, which describe a `2,2,4,5-` isomer.\n\n3.  **Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **At New C2 (from original C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration. The starting configuration at C6 was **S**. Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 will be **R**.\n    *   **At New C1 (from original C1):** This center was not attacked, so its configuration is retained. It was **R** and remains **R**.\n    *   **At New C4 (from original C4):** This center was unaffected by the reaction. It was **R** and remains **R**.\n    *   **At New C5 (from original C3):** This center was also unaffected. It was **R** and remains **R**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagent:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n        *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring (the 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core).\n        *   The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n        *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   The stereochemistry at the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is specified as R, R, R, and S, respectively.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This provides a soft nucleophile, `Me-` (a methyl anion equivalent).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism, Regioselectivity, and Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The problem statement provides a key rule for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n        *   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n        *   C1 is a quaternary carbon because it is bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms (C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n        *   C6 is a tertiary carbon because it is bonded to three other non-hydrogen atoms (C1, C5, O) and one hydrogen.\n        *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group (`Me-`) will occur at C6.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem also states: \"in the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n        *   This describes an Sₙ2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism.\n        *   The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack).\n        *   The starting configuration at the attack site, C6, is given as `S`.\n        *   Due to the Sₙ2 mechanism, there will be an inversion of configuration at C6. Therefore, the stereochemistry at this carbon in the product must be `R`.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction involves the `Me-` nucleophile attacking C6, and the C6-O bond breaking. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after acidic or aqueous workup.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group and a methyl group on C1 (from the starting material), a new methyl group on C6, and the original methyl groups on C3 and C4. So, it's a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n    *   To name the product using IUPAC rules, the carbon atom bearing the primary functional group (-OH) gets the lowest possible number, C1. This carbon was C1 in the starting material.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (positions) to the methyl groups.\n        *   Numbering C1 → C2(old C6) → C3(old C5) → C4(old C4) → C5(old C3) → C6(old C2) places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Thus, the base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This conclusion eliminates options A and C, which have the incorrect molecular structure `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (this would result from an attack at C1).\n\n4.  **Determine the Full Stereochemical Name of the Product:**\n    *   We are left with options B and D:\n        *   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry of each center in the product:\n        *   **At C2 (the site of attack, old C6):** We established that the configuration must invert from `S` to `R`. So, the product must be `2R`. This immediately eliminates option B (which has `2S`) and points strongly to option D.\n        *   **At C4 (old C4) and C5 (old C3):** These centers are not directly involved in the reaction. Their geometric configuration is retained. Therefore, their R/S descriptors are expected to remain the same. Old C3 was `R`, so new C5 is `R`. Old C4 was `R`, so new C4 is `R`. This is consistent with both options B and D.\n        *   **At C1:** This center is not attacked, but one of its bonds (C1-O) is broken. The geometric configuration is retained. However, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents can change, which might change the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that the priorities of the substituents on C1 do change, which should invert the descriptor from `R` to `S`. Option D lists C1 as `R`.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   There is a conflict. The fundamental chemical principle of Sₙ2 inversion dictates that C6(`S`) must become C2(`R`). This selects option D.\n    *   A rigorous application of CIP priority rules suggests C1(`R`) should become C1(`S`), which contradicts option D.\n    *   In such scenarios in chemistry problems, the stereochemical outcome of the core reaction mechanism (the Sₙ2 inversion) is the most critical and defining feature. Errors in assigning CIP descriptors for remote, complex centers in provided options are more common than the question contradicting a fundamental reaction principle.\n    *   Therefore, we prioritize the fact that C2 must be `R`. This makes D the only plausible answer.\n\n    The correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n### Breakdown of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: The reagent is Me2CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent. These reagents are a source of soft nucleophiles, in this case, a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Key Principles**: The problem provides two crucial rules for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides, which are well-established in organic chemistry:\n    *   **Regioselectivity**: The incoming nucleophile (the methyl group from the cuprate) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring. This occurs because organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and the reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the SN2 reaction mechanism.\n\n3.  **Applying the Principles to the Specific Molecule**:\n    *   **Identifying the point of attack**: The epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane system.\n        *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n        *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n        *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and it will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent.\n    *   **Determining the stereochemical outcome**: The attack on C6 proceeds via an SN2 mechanism.\n        *   The initial configuration at C6 is given as (S).\n        *   An SN2 reaction causes an inversion of stereochemistry.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at the carbon atom that was C6 will become (R) in the product.\n    *   **Predicting the product's structure**:\n        *   The methyl group attacks C6, and the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   A new methyl group is now attached to the former C6.\n        *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the reaction and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n4.  **Naming the Final Product**:\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1.\n    *   **Mapping from old numbering to new**:\n        *   Old **C1** (with an R configuration, a methyl group, and the new -OH group) becomes the new **C1**. Its configuration remains (R).\n        *   Old **C6** (with an S configuration, attacked by Me⁻) becomes the new **C2**. Its configuration inverts to (R).\n        *   Old **C4** (with an R configuration and a methyl group) becomes the new **C4**. Its configuration remains (R).\n        *   Old **C3** (with an R configuration and a methyl group) becomes the new **C5**. Its configuration remains (R).\n    *   The resulting product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5, making it a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors are (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n    Combining the name and stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Epoxide Structure:**\n    *   The core is a `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` which is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide.\n    *   The bridgehead carbons where the epoxide is fused are C1 and C6.\n    *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n3.  **Determine Regioselectivity:** The user prompt correctly states that organocuprates, being soft nucleophiles, attack the *less* sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary center.\n    *   C6 is substituted only with hydrogens (apart from the ring carbons and oxygen), making it a tertiary center.\n    *   Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack). This attack results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The site of attack is C6, which has an initial configuration of (S).\n    *   The S_N2 attack will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n    *   The C1-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked, so its configuration is retained. The same applies to the stereocenters at C3 and C4.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol.\n    *   The hydroxyl group is on the original C1. For IUPAC naming, this carbon becomes C1 of the product.\n    *   The original C1 also has a methyl group.\n    *   A new methyl group from the Gilman reagent is added to the original C6. Following IUPAC rules to give the lowest locants, this carbon becomes C2.\n    *   The methyl groups on the original C3 and C4 are now on C5 and C4, respectively (renumbering the ring starting from the C1-OH).\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n6.  **Assign Stereochemistry to the Product:**\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** Configuration is retained. It was (1R) and remains (R).\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** Configuration is inverted due to S_N2 attack. It goes from (6S) to (R). Thus, the product has a (2R) center.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** Configuration is retained. It was (4R) and remains (R).\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** Configuration is retained. It was (3R) and remains (R).\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The final product has the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nThe reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism. Based on the principles of this reaction, the outcome for the specified reactant can be determined by following two key rules regarding regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Reactants Analysis:**\n*   **Epoxide:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound containing a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The epoxide connects carbons 1 and 6 of the cyclohexane core.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent, which serves as a source for a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nThe first rule dictates that the nucleophile from the organocuprate will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   Carbon-1 (C1) of the epoxide is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   Carbon-6 (C6) of the epoxide is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\nFollowing this rule, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) will preferentially attack the less hindered C6.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe second rule states that the reaction is an S_N2-type attack, which means the nucleophile adds to the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon center that is attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the attacked carbon, C6, is (S).\n*   Due to the S_N2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become (R).\nThe configurations of the other chiral centers in the molecule (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n**4. Product Formation:**\nThe nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n**5. Product Identification:**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The final product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereochemistry at the chiral centers is determined as follows:\n    *   **C1:** Retains its (R) configuration.\n    *   **C2 (originally C6):** Inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n    *   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the full IUPAC name of the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

It is a secondary carbon within the epoxide framework (tertiary overall).\n*   Due to the presence of the methyl group on C1, the C6 position is significantly less sterically hindered.\n*   **Conclusion**: The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton\n*   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring.\n*   A new methyl group is added to the carbon that was originally C6.\n*   The oxygen atom, which remains attached to the original C1, is protonated during the workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product, we follow IUPAC nomenclature. The carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is C1. Numbering to give the lowest possible locants places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the product's skeleton is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options A and C, which have a different skeleton (`2,2,4,5-...`). We are left with options B and D.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereoselectivity\nThe reaction is stereospecific and proceeds with an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n*   **Stereocenters Retained**: The configurations of the chiral centers that are not attacked (C1, C3, and C4) are retained. So, `(1R)`, `(3R)`, and `(4R)` will be maintained in the product at the corresponding carbons. After renumbering for the product, these become `(1R)`, `(5R)`, and `(4R)`, respectively.\n*   **Stereocenter Inverted**: The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(6S)**. The Sₙ2 mechanism causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out). However, to determine the final R/S descriptor, we must re-evaluate using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, as the priorities of the attached groups change.\n    *   **At reactant C6 (S):** The priorities are: `O` (1) > `C1` (2) > `C5` (3) > `H` (4).\n    *   **At product C2 (from old C6):** The substituents are now `C1(OH)` (1) > `C3(ring)` (2) > `new Me` (3) > `H` (4). The leaving group (O, priority 1) has been replaced by a group of a different priority (Me, priority 3). This is a known situation where a geometric inversion does **not** result in a flip of the R/S descriptor.\n    *   A careful analysis shows that after the geometric inversion, the new arrangement of substituents with the new priorities at this center gives a final configuration of **(S)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The configuration at the attacked carbon C6 (which becomes C2 in the product) is **S**.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nCombining the stereochemical analysis:\n*   The carbon from old C1 is **(1R)**.\n*   The carbon from old C6 is **(2S)**.\n*   The carbon from old C4 is **(4R)**.\n*   The carbon from old C3 is **(5R)**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane:** This is the core structure. It consists of a cyclohexane ring fused with a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6. The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl:** There are methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S):** This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring in a planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to show the stereochemistry.\n*   The bicyclo[4.1.0] system implies a cis-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on a wedge).\n*   **At C1 (R):** The substituents are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, and -CH3. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must also be \"up\" (wedge), cis to the epoxide.\n*   **At C6 (S):** The substituents are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, and -H. For the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be \"down\" (dash), trans to the epoxide.\n*   **At C3 (R):** The substituents are -C2-, -C4-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be \"up\" (wedge).\n*   **At C4 (R):** The substituents are -C5-, -C3-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must also be \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:** The epoxide ring and all three methyl groups are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (we've defined this as \"up\" or beta).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and attack epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is a backside attack, meaning the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack**\n\nThe epoxide is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less sterically hindered.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The C6-O bond is \"up\" (wedge). The nucleophile (Me⁻) must perform a backside attack, so it will approach from the \"down\" side (dash).\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, forming a lithium alkoxide at C1. Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting configuration at C6 is **S**. The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of configuration, so the new stereocenter at this carbon will be **R**. The new methyl group will be \"down\" (alpha), and the original hydrogen at C6 will be pushed \"up\" (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry at other centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the reaction, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   C1 remains **R**.\n    *   C3 remains **R**.\n    *   C4 remains **R**.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol. The -OH group is at the original C1 position. There are methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), and C5(old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C3(old C4), C4(old C3), and C6(old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. So the name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted (S -> R) -> **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The prompt states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and are highly sensitive to steric hindrance. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to two other ring carbons (C2, C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom and two other ring carbons (C1, C5) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    Due to the significant steric bulk of the methyl group on C1 compared to the hydrogen on C6, the incoming nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will preferentially attack the less hindered **C6**. This regioselectivity eliminates options C and D, which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds through an S_N2-type mechanism. A key feature of the S_N2 reaction is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack).\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**.\n    *   The S_N2 attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an acidic workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions (C1, C3, C4) and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (original C1) is now C1. The carbon that was attacked (original C6) is now C2.\n*   The stereochemistry of the product will be:\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C6 inverts to become C2: (6S) → **(2R)**\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C3 retains its configuration and becomes C5: **(5R)**\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with the specified absolute configurations.\n    *   The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is across C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   The attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the oxygen (attached to C1) is later protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Constitution of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The starting molecule has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The product will have an -OH and a -CH₃ on the original C1. It will have a new -CH₃ on the original C6. It will retain the original -CH₃ groups at C3 and C4.\n    *   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at the new C1, new C2 (old C6), new C4 (old C4), and new C5 (old C3). The locants are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and B, which are constitutional isomers resulting from attack at the wrong carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) **retain their absolute configuration**.\n    *   Let's map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product:\n        *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n        *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R)\n        *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n        *   Reactant C6 (S) → Product C2 (inverted configuration)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options C and D.\n    *   The final step is to determine the configuration at C2, which results from the inversion of C6(S). While the geometric configuration is inverted, the R/S descriptor might not flip from S to R because the priorities of the substituents change. We must analyze this carefully.\n        *   Priorities at reactant C6: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   Priorities at product C2: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a Walden inversion, meaning the spatial arrangement of the three non-reacting groups (H, C1, C5) is inverted relative to the central carbon.\n        *   Let's analyze the consequence for the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that when the leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3), and the other priorities shift, the descriptor for the inverted center remains (S).\n        *   Therefore, C6(S) becomes C2(S) after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product has the absolute configuration (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This corresponds to the name (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the product of a chemical reaction.\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis:\n# 1.

The `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring. The fusion points are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring with the epoxide fused to it. The stereochemistry at C1 and C6 determines that the epoxide ring is cis-fused. Let's assume the oxygen atom is on the 'up' (beta) face of the ring.\n*   At **C1**, which is `R`, the C1-O bond is 'up'. For it to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C6**, which is `S`, the C6-O bond is 'up'. For it to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C3**, which is `R`, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C4**, which is `R`, the methyl group must also be 'down' (alpha).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the oxygen atom on one face, and all three methyl groups are on the opposite face.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n\nThe reagent is **Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, a Gilman reagent.\n*   This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe problem states a key rule for organocuprates reacting with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n*   Clearly, C6 is sterically less hindered than C1.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This means the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken (the backside).\n*   In our structure, the C6-O bond is on the 'up' face.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile must attack C6 from the **'down' face**.\n*   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed to the 'up' position. The new methyl group is added to the 'down' position.\n*   The C1-O bond also breaks (after the initial attack), and upon aqueous workup, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\nLet's summarize the resulting structure:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is opened to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is at the original C1 position, and its stereochemistry is retained ('up').\n*   The methyl group at the original C1 position remains 'down'.\n*   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain 'down'.\n*   A new methyl group is added at the original C6 position and is 'down'.\n\nNow, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   **Parent Name:** The main functional group is the alcohol, so it is a `cyclohexanol`. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Starting from the OH-carbon as C1, numbering counter-clockwise (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give locants {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so we use this numbering scheme.\n*   **Full Name (without stereochemistry):** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the R/S configuration for the chiral centers in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   **New C1 (original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was R in the starting material. So, it is **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (original C6):** The configuration is inverted due to the Sₙ2 attack. The original configuration was S. One might assume it becomes R, but we must re-evaluate using CIP rules because the substituent priorities have changed.\n    *   At New C2, the groups are H ('up'), Me ('down'), C1, and C3.\n    *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards us ('up'), we trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group towards the viewer means the configuration is **S**. So, it is **2S**.\n*   **New C4 (original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` means the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, which defines an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given R/S configurations define the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows:\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the α-face (pointing \"down\" relative to the plane of the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The hydrogen atom at C6 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that organocuprates attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack. The problem states that this results in an \"inversion of configuration\" at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.\n    *   The nucleophile (CH₃⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the α-face (down).\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will attack C6 from the β-face (top).\n\n**3. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack at C6:** The incoming methyl group adds to the β-face of C6. The C6-O bond breaks. This causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration of C6 was S, so the new configuration at this carbon will be R.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not affected by the reaction, so the -OH group will be on the α-face (down), just as the oxygen atom was.\n3.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they retain their original R configurations.\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned the lowest possible number, C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant is the new C1 of the product.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now substituted with the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (The alternative numbering would give 1, 3, 4, 6, which is a higher set of locants).\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3\n3.  **Base Name:** The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe now assign the R/S configuration to each stereocenter in the product based on the reaction mechanism:\n*   **New C1 (from Old C1):** The configuration is retained. Old C1 was R. → **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (from Old C6):** The configuration is inverted. Old C6 was S. → **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (from Old C4):** The configuration is retained. Old C4 was R. → **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (from Old C3):** The configuration is retained. Old C3 was R. → **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which can be used to determine the structure of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring, and the \"7-oxa\" designation confirms this is an epoxide. The stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S) defines the specific three-dimensional arrangement of the substituents. Based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the epoxide oxygen and the methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 are all on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (beta, or 'up').\n\n2.  **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, lithium dimethylcuprate. In this reagent, the methyl group (Me) acts as a soft nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The first rule provided states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack this position.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The second rule states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an S_N2-type reaction mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond of the epoxide (anti-attack).\n    *   In the starting material, the epoxide ring is on the beta face ('up').\n    *   The methyl nucleophile must therefore attack C6 from the alpha face ('down').\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The hydrogen originally at C6 (alpha) is pushed to the beta position, and the new methyl group takes the alpha position.\n    *   The C1-O bond also breaks (as part of the ring opening), and the oxygen atom is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked and retains its original configuration. The resulting -OH group will be on the beta face.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected by the reaction and retain their configurations.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, a new product is formed:\n*   The cyclohexane ring remains.\n*   An alcohol (-OH) is formed at C1, with beta stereochemistry.\n*   A new methyl group is added at C6, with alpha stereochemistry.\n*   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 retain their positions and stereochemistry.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. Numbering proceeds around the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, which results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThe final step is to assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each chiral center in the product:\n*   **C1:** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C2 (originally C6):** The starting configuration was S. The SN2 attack causes a geometric inversion. However, due to changes in substituent priorities under the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the final designation for this center is S. This is a known phenomenon where geometric inversion does not lead to an R/S descriptor change.\n*   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its original R configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe analysis of the reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate relies on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) mechanism. This mechanism has specific consequences for both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring (forming the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core). The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. There are methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates are known to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a secondary carbon.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry:**\nThe reaction proceeds through an SN2-type mechanism, which results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus remain unchanged as (1R, 3R, 4R).\n\n**4. Product Identification and Nomenclature:**\nThe attack of the methyl group on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and subsequent protonation (during workup) places a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1. The resulting product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name the product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the highest priority and is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the carbon that was attacked (the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Stereochemical Assignment:**\nCombining the stereochemical outcomes with the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThus, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction involves the ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this reaction are key to determining the correct product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and, in reactions with epoxides, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom and carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and three other carbons (C2, C5, and C6).\n    *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen and three other carbons (C1, C2, and C5).\n    *   Comparing the two, C6 is the less sterically hindered position. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   This causes an inversion of the stereochemistry at C6. The starting material has a (6S) configuration. After the reaction, this center will have an (R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming step with the nucleophile, so its configuration (1R) is retained.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected, so their configurations (3R, 4R) are retained.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure\n\n*   **Attack at C6**: The methyl group adds to C6.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the C1-O bond becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an aqueous workup (which is implicit in this type of reaction).\n*   **Resulting Structure**: The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 from the original molecule, plus a new methyl group at the site of attack (C6).\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product**:\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. This carbon also has a methyl group.\n    *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (originally C6) is now C2. It has the newly added methyl group.\n    *   The original C4 is still C4.\n    *   The original C3 is now C5.\n    *   The product is named 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### Determining the Product Stereochemistry\n\n*   **C1**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C2 (from C6)**: Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n*   **C4 (from C4)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C5 (from C3)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe calculated product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, C1 and C6. This is also known as cyclohexene oxide.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nTo apply the reaction rules, we must first determine the 3D structure, specifically the relative orientation (up/down or beta/alpha) of the epoxide and the substituents. Let's assume the plane of the cyclohexane ring is the reference.\n\n1.  Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing 'up' (beta face).\n2.  We need to place the substituents (Me on C1, H on C6, Me on C3, Me on C4) as either 'up' (beta) or 'down' (alpha) to satisfy the given R/S configurations.\n    *   **At C6 (S):** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be S, the H at C6 must also be 'up' (beta, syn to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C1 (R):** The groups are O, C6, C2, Me. Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha, anti to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C4 (R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, H. Priorities are C3 > C5 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must be 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C3 (R):** The groups are C4, C2, Me, H. Priorities are C4 > C2 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be 'down' (alpha).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide oxygen: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Methyl: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **up (beta)**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). The nucleophile is effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6. The C6-O bond is 'up' (beta), so the attack occurs from the 'down' (alpha) side.\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom becomes an alkoxide (O⁻), which is then protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n3.  Let's trace the stereochemistry of each part of the molecule:\n    *   **At C1:** The configuration is **retained**. The original C1-Me was 'down' (alpha), and it remains 'down'. The C1-O bond was 'up' (beta), so the new C1-OH group is 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C6:** The configuration is **inverted**. The incoming methyl group adds from the 'down' (alpha) side. The original C6-H was 'up' (beta), and it remains 'up'.\n    *   **At C3 and C4:** These centers are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are **retained**. C3-Me remains 'down' (alpha), and C4-Me remains 'up' (beta).\n\n**Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry:**\n*   C1-OH: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Me: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Me (newly added): **down (alpha)**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Numbering:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The -OH group gets priority, so it is on C1. We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on C1, C3, C4, and C6 of the original ring.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C6 → C5 → C4 → C3 → C2 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5 → C6 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}. So the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches options A and B.\n\n2.  **Assigning R/S Configuration to the Product:** We use the relative stereochemistry determined in Step 3 and the new numbering system.\n    *   New C1 is original C1.\n    *   New C2 is original C6.\n    *   New C4 is original C4.\n    *   New C5 is original C3.\n\n    Let's assign the configuration for each chiral center using wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha).\n    *   **C1:** OH (wedge), Me (dash). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Looking down the C1-Me bond (lowest priority, dash), the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from C6):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C2-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C1 → C3 → Me is clockwise. Since we are looking from the front, we reverse the result. Clockwise → Counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (from C4):** Me (wedge), H (dash). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C4-H bond (lowest priority, dash), the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from C3):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Looking down the C5-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C4 → C6 → Me is counter-clockwise. Reverse the result. Counter-clockwise → Clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\nThe full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Scaffold:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, which are numbered C1 and C6 according to bicyclic nomenclature.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration at the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure. We can draw the molecule in a half-chair conformation, which is typical for cyclohexene derivatives. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C1 (must be R):** The priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH3. For the configuration to be (R) with the oxygen \"up\", the C1-methyl group must be pointing \"down\" (on the α face).\n*   **At C6 (must be S):** The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be (S) with the oxygen \"up\", the hydrogen at C6 must also be pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C3 (must be R):** The priorities are C4(with Me) > C2 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C3-methyl group must be in an axial-like \"down\" position (α face).\n*   **At C4 (must be R):** The priorities are C3(with Me) > C5 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C4-methyl group must be in an equatorial-like \"up\" position (β face).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the following stereochemical features (visualized with the epoxide ring on the top face):\n*   Epoxide O: Up (β)\n*   C1-Me: Down (α)\n*   C3-Me: Down (α)\n*   C4-Me: Up (β)\n*   C6-H: Up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is a methyl anion (Me⁻), which is considered a \"soft\" nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is \"up\" (β), the methyl group will attack from the \"down\" side (α). This is known as an anti-diaxial opening.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The Me⁻ group attacks C6 from the α face (\"down\").\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen, which is attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n3.  A subsequent acidic workup (not explicitly shown but always implied) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n4.  The resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexanol. The ring will adopt a stable chair conformation.\n\nLet's track the stereochemistry of each group in the product:\n*   **At C1:** The C1-O bond becomes C1-OH. Since the oxygen was \"up\" (β), the OH group is \"up\" (β). The original C1-Me group was \"down\" (α) and remains so.\n*   **At C6:** The incoming Me group attacks from \"down\" (α). The original H at C6 was \"up\" (β) and remains so.\n*   **At C3 & C4:** The methyl groups are not involved in the reaction and retain their original stereochemistry: C3-Me is \"down\" (α) and C4-Me is \"up\" (β).\n\n**Step 4: Name the Product and Determine its Absolute Configuration**\n\nFirst, we need to number the cyclohexane ring of the product according to IUPAC rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group is **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the epoxide.\n\nWe then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Path 1 (clockwise): C1 -> orig C2 -> orig C3 -> orig C4 -> orig C5 -> orig C6. Methyl groups are at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n*   Path 2 (counter-clockwise): C1 -> orig C6 -> orig C5 -> orig C4 -> orig C3 -> orig C2. Methyl groups are at 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nThe set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nNow, we must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) of the most stable conformer.\n\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** The anti-diaxial opening initially produces a high-energy chair conformer with the C1-OH and the new C2-Me in axial positions. The ring will flip to a more stable conformer.\n    *   Initial conformer (less stable): C1-OH (axial), C1-Me (equatorial), C2-Me (axial), C4-Me (equatorial), C5-Me (axial). (3 axial groups)\n    *   Flipped conformer (more stable): C1-OH (equatorial), C1-Me (axial), C2-Me (equatorial), C4-Me (axial), C5-Me (equatorial). (2 axial groups)\n    We will assign the R/S configuration based on this more stable flipped conformer.\n\n*   **R/S Assignment (on the stable conformer):**\n    *   **C1:** Has OH (eq, β), Me (ax, α). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Viewing down the C1-Me (axial) bond, the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (orig C6):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C2-H (axial) bond, the path C1 → C3 → Me is counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (orig C4):** Has Me (ax, β), H (eq, α). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C4-H (equatorial) bond is tricky, but careful analysis shows the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (orig C3):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Viewing down the C5-H (axial) bond, the path C4 → C6 → Me is clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\nCombining these results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to predict the product of a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide using an organocuprate reagent. We must apply the given rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Rules:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide and is also substituted with a methyl group (from the name `1,3,4-trimethyl...`). This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide but has no methyl substituent. It is bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 attack inverts this configuration, so the new stereocenter at this position will be **(R)**.\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (which is standard procedure to isolate the alcohol product) protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\nThe reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   **Structure:** The product has an -OH group at the original C1 position and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are also present.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as **C1** in the product's name.\n    2.  We must number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible set of locants. The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one on C6.\n        *   **Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups are at positions 1 (on new C1), 2 (the new methyl on original C6), 4 (on original C4), and 5 (on original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   **Numbering clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the locant sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower. Thus, the correct base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Assigning Final Stereochemistry:** We use the correct (counter-clockwise) numbering to assign the stereodescriptors.\n    *   **New C1** (was original C1): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (was original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (was original C4): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (was original C3): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n\nThe full and correct IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This matches our result perfectly.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this mechanism).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge is an oxygen atom, meaning this is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   To determine the 3D structure, we use the given stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S). We can draw the molecule on a plane with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to represent its stereochemistry. A consistent assignment is:\n        *   The epoxide oxygen is on the 'up' face (beta, wedge).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (1R) configuration. (Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (6S) configuration. (Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (3R) configuration. (Priorities: C4 > C2 > Me > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (4R) configuration. (Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H).\n    *   So, the starting material has the epoxide ring on one face of the cyclohexane ring, and the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are all on the opposite face.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent and Reaction:**\n    *   The reagent is **Me2CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n        1.  The alkyl group attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Attack:**\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   C6 is less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n    *   In our model, the C6-O bond is 'up'. Thus, the Me⁻ attacks C6 from the 'down' side.\n    *   This attack causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed 'up'. The new methyl group from the cuprate is added to the 'down' position.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen atom, which is still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). After acidic workup (implied), it becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C1-O bond was 'up', the resulting OH group at C1 will also be 'up'.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The OH group is at C1 and is 'up'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4 is 'down'.\n    *   The new methyl group (from Me2CuLi) is at C6 and is 'down'.\n    *   So, the final product has an 'up' OH group, and all four methyl groups are 'down' (i.e., trans to the OH group).\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   First, we must number the product according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6. Numbering from the new C1 (original C1), the methyl locants are {1, 3, 4, 6}, regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   *Note*: The options provide product names with locants {1, 2, 4, 5} or {2, 2, 4, 5}. This indicates a flaw in the problem statement, as the locants derived from the starting material do not match those in the options. We must assume this is a typo in the question and proceed by determining the correct stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the product we've derived, and find the option that matches it. The most likely scenario is that the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes C2 in the product name provided in the options.\n    *   Now, we assign the R/S configuration to each chiral center of our derived product structure (OH up, all four Me down), assuming the numbering {1, 2, 4, 5} as given in options B and D.\n        *   **C1**: Has OH(up), Me(down). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. With Me(4) pointing away (down/dash), the sequence OH(1)→C2(2)→C6(3) is clockwise. Thus, **C1 is (R)**.\n        *   **C2 (original C6)**: Has new Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C1(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. Since H is towards us, we reverse the assignment. Thus, **C2 is (S)**.\n        *   **C4**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C5(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is counter-clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C4 is (R)**.\n        *   **C5**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C4(1)→C6(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C5 is (S)**.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the C5 assignment using a chair conformation, as planar drawings can be misleading. In the most stable chair, C5-Me is axial (down) and C5-H is equatorial (up). Let's put the lowest priority group (H) in the back by rotating the molecule. This is complex. Let's re-verify the C5 R/S assignment from the options. Both B and D list C5 as (R). Let's re-calculate.\n    *   Let's use the stable chair conformation: OH(eq,up), C1-Me(ax,down), C2-Me(eq,down), C4-Me(eq,down), C5-Me(ax,down).\n        *   **C5**: Me is axial down (away). H is equatorial up (front-ish). Priorities: C4(1) > C6(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Let's put Me(3) in the back. The sequence C4(1) -> C6(2) -> H(4) is clockwise. So, **C5 is (R)**.\n    *   So the calculated stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Our calculated product stereochemistry is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This matches option B exactly.\n\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived stereochemistry.**\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nDespite the inconsistency in the locant numbering between the starting material and the options, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction points unambiguously to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules regarding its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which are key to determining the final product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are also methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: Me2CuLi (a Gilman reagent) provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me-).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are considered \"soft\" nucleophiles. In reactions with epoxides, they preferentially attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material. Due to the SN2 inversion, its configuration in the product will become (R).\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained, so it remains (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations also remain (R).\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The reaction adds a new methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The original C1 (now with an -OH and a methyl group) is the new C1.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one), 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred as it is lower.

We will use wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha).\n\n*   To satisfy the given stereochemical descriptors (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S), the correct structure is:\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is **alpha** (pointing down, dashed).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is **beta** (pointing up, wedged).\n    *   The hydrogen at C6 is **beta** (pointing up, wedged).\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is **beta** (pointing up, wedged).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is **alpha** (pointing down, dashed).\n\nLet's verify this assignment:\n*   **C1 (R):** Priorities: O(1) > C6(2) > C2(3) > Me(4). The lowest priority group (Me) is wedged (up). The path from 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise. Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the configuration from S to R. This is correct.\n*   **C6 (S):** Priorities: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The lowest priority group (H) is wedged (up). The path from 1 to 2 to 3 is clockwise. Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the configuration from R to S. This is correct.\n*   **C3 (R):** Priorities: C4(1) > C2(2) > Me(3) > H(4). The methyl group is wedged (up), so the hydrogen is dashed (down). The path from 1 to 2 to 3 is clockwise. The lowest priority group is pointing away, so the configuration is R. This is correct.\n*   **C4 (R):** Priorities: C3(1) > C5(2) > Me(3) > H(4). The methyl group is dashed (down), so the hydrogen is wedged (up). The path from 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise. Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the configuration from S to R. This is correct.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). The nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. The problem states two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** (SN2-like).\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction Rules to the Reactant**\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, and C6).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen, C1, and C5).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the Me⁻ nucleophile will attack C6. This eliminates options A and B, which would result from attack at C1.\n\n*   **Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide is alpha (down).\n    *   The attack must be anti-periplanar, meaning the Me⁻ will approach from the **beta face** (top side).\n    *   The hydrogen at C6, which was originally beta (up), will be pushed down to the alpha position.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and after acidic workup, the oxygen attached to C1 becomes an alcohol (-OH). Since the C1-O bond was alpha, the resulting -OH group at C1 is also **alpha** (down).\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nBased on the reaction, the substituents and their stereochemistry in the product are:\n*   At C1: An **alpha** -OH group and a **beta** methyl group.\n*   At C3: A **beta** methyl group (unchanged).\n*   At C4: An **alpha** methyl group (unchanged).\n*   At C6: A new **beta** methyl group (from the cuprate) and an **alpha** hydrogen (due to inversion).\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The parent compound is a cyclohexanol. The OH group defines C1. To give the methyl substituents the lowest locants, we number counter-clockwise.\n    *   Old C1 -> New C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   Old C6 -> New C2 (has a new -Me)\n    *   Old C5 -> New C3\n    *   Old C4 -> New C4 (has -Me)\n    *   Old C3 -> New C5 (has -Me)\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This confirms we should be looking at options C and D.\n\n*   **Assign R/S to the product's stereocenters:**\n    *   A careful R/S assignment on the product derived from the named starting material yields (1S, 2R, 4S, 5S). This does not match any of the options.\n    *   However, its enantiomer is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R), which matches option D. This suggests there might be an error in the provided name of the starting material in the question, and the intended reactant was the enantiomer. Let's verify this by reacting the enantiomer.\n\n**Alternative Path: Reacting the Enantiomer**\n\n*   Let's assume the starting material was the enantiomer: (1S,3S,4S,6R).\n    *   Structure: Epoxide-beta, C1-Me-alpha, C6-H-alpha, C3-Me-alpha, C4-Me-beta.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    *   Attack at C6 (less hindered).\n    *   C6-O bond is beta (up), so attack is from the alpha side (down).\n    *   New Me at C6 is alpha. H at C6 inverts to beta.\n    *   -OH at C1 is beta.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   At C1: beta -OH, alpha -Me.\n    *   At C6: alpha -Me, beta -H.\n    *   At C3: alpha -Me.\n    *   At C4: beta -Me.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry (after re-numbering):**\n    *   New C1: **R**\n    *   New C2: **S**\n    *   New C4: **R**\n    *   New C5: **R**\n*   This gives the product **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D exactly. Given the choices, it is highly probable that the intended reaction leads to this product.\n\nFinal Answer is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe reaction between an organocuprate, like lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), and an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The outcome of this reaction is governed by specific rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction involves (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). The bicyclic compound is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons 1 and 6. The nucleophile provided by the cuprate is a methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The first rule provided states that the incoming alkyl group (the nucleophile) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is formed between carbon C1 and carbon C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is also a tertiary carbon, but it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered position, and the nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack C6. This determines the connectivity of the resulting product, eliminating options that would arise from an attack at C1. The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, leaving the oxygen attached to C1, which becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an aqueous workup.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The second rule states that an inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon atom that is attacked. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The initial stereochemical configuration of C6 is given as (S).\n    *   Due to the Sₙ2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters in the molecule (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Initial Stereochemistry**:\n    *   C1: R\n    *   C3: R\n    *   C4: R\n    *   C6: S\n*   **Reaction Outcome**:\n    *   Attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The ring opens, and the C1-O bond becomes a C1-OH group. The stereocenter at C1 remains (R).\n    *   A new methyl group attaches to C6, and its stereocenter inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 remain (R).\n*   **Product Naming (IUPAC)**: The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6).\n    *   **New C1** corresponds to the **Old C1**. It has an -OH group and a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** corresponds to the **Old C6**. It now has a methyl group. Its configuration has inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** corresponds to the **Old C4**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** corresponds to the **Old C3**. It has a methyl group. Its configuration remains **(R)**.\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Reaction Analysis**\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction is between a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and an organocuprate (Gilman reagent), Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The Gilman reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (CH3-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Where does the nucleophile attack?**\n*   Organocuprates are \"soft\" nucleophiles and react with epoxides via an SN2-like mechanism. A key rule for this reaction is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The substrate `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   Let's examine the substitution at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is a secondary carbon center.\n*   Comparing the tertiary C1 and the secondary C6, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity: What is the stereochemical outcome?**\n*   The SN2 reaction mechanism involves a backside attack, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The configurations of chiral centers not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n*   Let's track the stereochemistry of each chiral center:\n    *   **Attack Site (C6):** The initial configuration at C6 is (S). Since the nucleophile attacks this carbon, its configuration will be inverted to **(R)**.\n    *   **Other Chiral Centers (C1, C3, C4):** These centers are not attacked. No bonds to these chiral atoms are broken or formed. Therefore, their configurations are retained.\n        *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring by adding a new methyl group to C6 and, after an aqueous workup, forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we prioritize the hydroxyl group. The carbon it's attached to (the original C1) becomes the new C1.\n*   We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (New C1 ← Old C1; New C2 ← Old C6; New C4 ← Old C4; New C5 ← Old C3). This gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Combining this with the stereochemistry determined in step 3:\n    *   New C1 (from old C1) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C2 (from old C6) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C4 (from old C4) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from old C3) is **(R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5.

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is A.\n\nThe correct option is: A\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze and Draw the Reactant Structure\nThe reactant is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6, and the oxygen is atom 7. This is a derivative of cyclohexene oxide.\n2.  **Substituents**: `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute configuration of the chiral centers. To satisfy all these configurations simultaneously, we must determine the orientation of the epoxide and the methyl groups.\n    *   Let's assume the cyclohexane ring is in a chair-like conformation.\n    *   A careful analysis of the R/S configurations reveals the following structure:\n        *   The epoxide ring is on the **alpha face** (pointing down).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n\n    *   **Verification of Stereocenters:**\n        *   **C1 (1R)**: Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the epoxide down (alpha) and Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n        *   **C6 (6S)**: Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the epoxide down (alpha) and H up (beta), the configuration is S.\n        *   **C3 (3R)**: Priorities C2 > C4 > Me > H. With Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n        *   **C4 (4R)**: Priorities C3 > C5 > Me > H. With Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction\n*   **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a \"soft\" methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction**: Organocuprates react with epoxides in an SN2-type nucleophilic ring-opening reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity\n*   The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n*   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity\n*   The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond).\n*   The epoxide ring is on the alpha face (down). So, the C6-O bond is pointing downwards.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the **beta face (up)**. This is called *anti*-attack.\n*   The SN2 reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Product Structure\n1.  **Attack at C6**: A new methyl group adds to C6 from the beta face (up).\n2.  **Inversion at C6**: The hydrogen atom originally at C6 (beta, up) is pushed to the alpha face (down).\n3.  **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n4.  **Work-up**: The resulting alkoxide ion at C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was alpha (down), the OH group will be on the alpha face (down).\n5.  **Spectator Groups**: The methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected and retain their beta (up) orientation.\n\n*   **Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The OH group is at C1 (alpha, down).\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is beta (up).\n    *   The new methyl group at C6 is beta (up).\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is beta (up).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is beta (up).\n    *   In conclusion, all four methyl groups are *cis* to each other (beta/up), and the hydroxyl group is *trans* to all of them (alpha/down).\n\n### Step 6: Name the Product and Assign Absolute Configurations\n1.  **IUPAC Numbering**: The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To give the substituents the lowest locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Old C1 → New C1 (has OH, Me)\n    *   Old C6 → New C2 (has Me)\n    *   Old C5 → New C3\n    *   Old C4 → New C4 (has Me)\n    *   Old C3 → New C5 (has Me)\n    *   The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n2.  **Assign R/S Configuration**: We assign the absolute configuration to each chiral center (C1, C2, C4, C5) based on the 3D structure derived in Step 5.\n    *   **C1**: Attached to OH (down), Me (up), C2, C6. Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C2**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C1, C3. Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **S**. (Note: SN2 inversion occurred, but due to changes in substituent priorities, the S descriptor of reactant C6 remains S for product C2).\n    *   **C4**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C3, C5. Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C5**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C4, C6. Priorities: C6 > C4 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n\n3.  **Final Product Name**: The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Step 7: Compare with Options\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived structure and name.**\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

The name indicates the following:\n        *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: A 6-membered ring (cyclohexane) fused with a 3-membered ring (the epoxide). The epoxide bridge is between carbons C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are located on carbons C1, C3, and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem states: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and O7.\n    *   Carbon C1 is attached to a methyl group, C2, C6, and O7. It is a quaternary carbon (tetrasubstituted).\n    *   Carbon C6 is attached to a hydrogen, C1, C5, and O7. It is a tertiary carbon (trisubstituted).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanol derivative where the -OH group is at the position of the original C1, and a new methyl group is at the position of the original C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product Skeleton:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) is designated as C1 in the product's IUPAC name.\n    *   This C1 also has the original methyl group from the starting material.\n    *   The new methyl group from the cuprate is on the adjacent carbon (original C6), which becomes C2 in the product name (numbering to give substituents the lowest locants).\n    *   The other original methyl groups are at C3 and C4 of the starting material. In the new numbering scheme, these become C5 and C4, respectively.\n    *   Product numbering: New C1 = Old C1; New C2 = Old C6; New C3 = Old C5; New C4 = Old C4; New C5 = Old C3; New C6 = Old C2.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The configurations of the chiral centers that are not part of the reaction (old C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   The configuration of the chiral center that is attacked (old C6) is inverted.\n\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted. The starting configuration was **S**. An inversion of stereochemistry means the 3D arrangement of the groups is flipped (e.g., a group that was 'down' is pushed 'up' by the incoming nucleophile from 'down'). We must determine the resulting R/S designation based on the new structure and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n\n    *   **Let's analyze the inversion at C6 -> C2:**\n        *   **At Old C6:** The configuration is S. The CIP priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n        *   **Reaction:** A backside attack replaces the C6-O bond with a C6-Me bond. The geometry inverts.\n        *   **At New C2 (Old C6):** The groups are now C1, C5 (which is new C3), H, and a new Me.\n        *   **New CIP priorities at C2:** The priority of the attached groups changes. C1 (bearing an OH group) is priority 1. C3 (a CH₂ group in the ring) is priority 2. The new methyl group is priority 3. Hydrogen is priority 4. So, C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   **Determining the new R/S label:** We must determine the configuration from the inverted geometry. The SN2 attack forces the substituents to flip their relative positions. If the original H at C6 was, for example, *alpha* (dashed, pointing down), the inversion would push it to *beta* (wedged, pointing up) as the new methyl group attacks from the *alpha* face.\n        *   Let's assume the starting epoxide O was *beta* (wedged). Then the H at C6 must be *alpha* (dashed) for the molecule to have S configuration.\n        *   After inversion, the new Me is *alpha* (dashed) and H is *beta* (wedged).\n        *   To determine the configuration at New C2, we look at the arrangement: C1(1), C3(2), Me(3, dashed), H(4, wedged).\n        *   According to the CIP rules, when the lowest priority group (H, priority 4) is wedged (pointing towards the viewer), we determine the direction of the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n        *   The sequence C1 -> C3 -> Me traces a clockwise (R) path.\n        *   Since H(4) is wedged, we reverse R to S.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at New C2 is **S**.\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Product Name:**\n    *   Skeleton: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Stereochemistry:\n        *   C1: **R**\n        *   C2: **S**\n        *   C4: **R**\n        *   C5: **R**\n    *   The full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The core structure is a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states that the alkyl group of the cuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a general rule for the S_N2-type opening of epoxides by basic or neutral nucleophiles.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6, the sterically less hindered position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group at C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   After an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom (attached to C1) is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. Let's determine their positions based on IUPAC nomenclature for the final product:\n        *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. This carbon also has its original methyl group.\n        *   Numbering the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants, the adjacent carbon (the original C6) where the new methyl group attached becomes C2.\n        *   The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 of the reactant are now at positions C5 and C4, respectively, in the product.\n        *   Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This allows us to eliminate options B and C.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity**: The problem states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the S_N2 reaction, where the nucleophile performs a backside attack relative to the leaving group.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (S) as given in the reactant's name.\n    *   The inversion of configuration means the stereocenter at this carbon will become (R) in the product.\n    *   In the product's IUPAC name, this carbon is C2. Therefore, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C3 and C4 in the reactant) are expected to retain their configuration. In the product, these correspond to C5 and C4. The reactant had (3R) and (4R), which correspond to (5R) and (4R) in the product.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is given as (1R) in the reactant. This center is not attacked, and its configuration is generally retained.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the product must be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol with a (2R), (4R), and (5R) configuration. Comparing the remaining options:\n    *   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe inversion at the site of attack (reactant C6 becoming product C2) from (S) to (R) definitively points to option D as the correct product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe reaction involves the opening of a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by a Gilman reagent, Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). To determine the final product, we must consider the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of this reaction.\n\n**1. Structure of the Reactant:**\nThe starting material is a bicyclic epoxide. The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered epoxide ring. The epoxide connects carbons 1 and 6. The molecule is further substituted with methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4, with the specific stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (a soft nucleophile) is an Sₙ2-type reaction. As a general rule, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide ring and is bonded to a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide ring but is only bonded to hydrogen atoms (and the ring carbons), making it a secondary carbon.\n\nTherefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe ring-opening proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves a backside attack by the nucleophile. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the point of attack, C6, is **S**.\n*   After the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to **R**.\n\nThe C1-O bond of the epoxide will break, and the oxygen will be protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The stereochemistry at C1 is not inverted as no bonds to the stereocenter are broken. Similarly, the stereocenters at C3 and C4 are unaffected by the reaction.\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   **Initial Stereocenters:** C1 (R), C3 (R), C4 (R), C6 (S).\n*   **Nucleophile:** A methyl group (Me).\n*   **Attack Site:** C6.\n*   **Resulting Stereocenters in the Product (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols):**\n    *   The original C1 becomes **C1** of the cyclohexanol. It retains its **R** configuration. It bears the hydroxyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   The original C6 becomes **C2**. The attack causes inversion from S to **R**. It now bears a new methyl group from the cuprate.\n    *   The original C3 becomes **C4**. It retains its **R** configuration.\n    *   The original C4 becomes **C5**. It retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **Nomenclature:** The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Final Name:** Combining the stereochemistry and the structure gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states, and chemical principles confirm, that the nucleophilic alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide is formed across carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not. Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction is an Sₙ2 displacement, which occurs with a complete inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked. The initial configuration at C6 is given as (S). The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n\n3.  **Fate of Other Stereocenters**:\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they will retain their original (R) configurations.\n    *   The bond between C1 and the epoxide oxygen is cleaved, and upon workup, this oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the nucleophilic attack does not occur at C1, its configuration is retained as (R).\n\n### Determining the Product:\n\n*   **Starting Material Stereochemistry (Original Numbering)**: C1 is (R), C3 is (R), C4 is (R), and C6 is (S).\n*   **Reaction Outcome**: The methyl group attacks C6, inverting its stereocenter from (S) to (R). The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain unchanged.\n*   **Product Structure**: The reaction opens the bicyclic ring to form a substituted cyclohexanol. The original C1 now bears both its original methyl group and a new hydroxyl group. The original C6 now bears the new methyl group from the cuprate.\n*   **IUPAC Renumbering**: For naming the product, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The adjacent carbon, the original C6, becomes the new C2. Following this, the original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry (IUPAC Numbering)**:\n    *   New C1 (from original C1): (R)\n    *   New C2 (from original C6): Inverts from (S) to (R)\n    *   New C4 (from original C4): (R)\n    *   New C5 (from original C3): (R)\n\nThe resulting product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol with the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The name also provides the absolute stereochemistry at these chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction**\nThe problem statement provides the key rules for this transformation:\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (the methyl group from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereospecificity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1, C6, and the oxygen atom. The two carbons where the attack can occur are C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two positions:\n    *   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to the oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group. It is a **tertiary** carbon center (within the bicyclic system).\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to the oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom. It is a **secondary** carbon center.\n*   A secondary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, according to the rule, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   When the methyl nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n*   A subsequent acidic workup (implied in this type of reaction) protonates the resulting alkoxide (O⁻) to form an alcohol (OH) group.\n*   Therefore, the final product will have:\n    *   An OH group at the position of the original C1.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4.\n    *   A **new** methyl group at C6.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. Let's determine its IUPAC name. The carbon bearing the OH group receives the lowest number, so the original C1 is the new C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The adjacent carbon (the original C6) has the newly added methyl group, so we number in that direction.\n    *   New C1 = Original C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Original C6 (has new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Original C5\n    *   New C4 = Original C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Original C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Original C2\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The starting material has the absolute configuration: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack at C6. This means the stereochemistry at C6 will be inverted.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) will retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's track the changes:\n    *   Configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C3 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C6 inverts from **S** to **R**.\n*   Now, we map these configurations onto the newly numbered product:\n    *   Product C1 (from original C1) has the configuration **(1R)**.\n    *   Product C2 (from original C6) has the configuration **(2R)**.\n    *   Product C4 (from original C4) has the configuration **(4R)**.\n    *   Product C5 (from original C3) has the configuration **(5R)**.\n*   The full IUPAC name for the product, including stereochemistry, is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6.

Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The numbering system for bicyclic compounds starts at one bridgehead (C1), goes around the longest bridge (C2-C3-C4-C5) to the other bridgehead (C6), and then numbers the atoms in the shorter bridge (O7).\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This is the most complex part. We need to determine the 3D arrangement of all groups.\n    *   The fusion of the epoxide to the 6-membered ring must be **cis**. This means the two C-O bonds (C1-O7 and C6-O7) are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing **up (beta)**.\n    *   This cis-fusion forces the other substituents on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C6) to be on the opposite face. In this case, the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C6. However, the given stereochemistry (1R, 6S) seems contradictory if both are *trans* to the epoxide. Let's verify.\n        *   **Priorities at C1:** O > C6 > C2 > Me. If Me is down (alpha, trans to the up-epoxide), the configuration is (1R). This matches the name.\n        *   **Priorities at C6:** O > C1 > C5 > H. If H is down (alpha, trans to the up-epoxide), the configuration is (6R). This contradicts the name (6S).\n    *   To obtain (6S), the hydrogen at C6 must be **up (beta, cis to the up-epoxide)**. A swap from down to up inverts the configuration from R to S. This implies an unusual conformation, but it is necessary to satisfy the given IUPAC name.\n    *   **Stereocenters C3 and C4:** For (3R) and (4R), with the methyl groups being higher priority than hydrogen, both methyl groups must be pointing **up (beta)**. They are cis to each other and cis to the epoxide ring.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide ring: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C1: **down (alpha)**\n*   Hydrogen at C6: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C3: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C4: **up (beta)**\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Rule 1: Regioselectivity:** The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n    *   This immediately rules out options A and B, which would result from an attack at C1. (Attack at C1 would lead to a product with an OH on C6 and two methyls on C1, which when re-numbered according to IUPAC rules gives a 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanol derivative).\n\n*   **Rule 2: Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n    *   This is a classic Sₙ2-type reaction. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   Since the epoxide C-O bond at C6 is **up (beta)**, the `Me⁻` nucleophile must attack from the **down (alpha)** side.\n    *   The configuration at C6, which was **(S)**, will invert to **(R)**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product Structure and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The `Me⁻` attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n2.  **Stereochemistry of Centers:**\n    *   **Center of Attack (Old C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to (R). In the final product, this carbon will be C2 in the IUPAC name. So, we expect a **(2R)** configuration.\n    *   **Other Epoxide Carbon (Old C1):** This carbon is not attacked, and its configuration is retained. It started as (1R) and remains **(1R)**. This will be C1 in the product name.\n    *   **Other Chiral Centers (Old C3 and C4):** These are remote from the reaction site, so their configurations are also retained. Old C3 was (R), and Old C4 was (R).\n3.  **Renaming the Product (IUPAC):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the -OH at Old C1, so this carbon becomes **New C1**.\n    *   To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number clockwise around the ring.\n    *   Old C6 (the site of attack) becomes **New C2**.\n    *   Old C5 becomes **New C3**.\n    *   Old C4 becomes **New C4**.\n    *   Old C3 becomes **New C5**.\n    *   Old C2 becomes **New C6**.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Conclusion\nComparing our derived product with the given options:\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect regiochemistry)\nB) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect regiochemistry)\nC) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Matches our analysis)\n\nThe correct product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons 1 and 6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`CH₃⁻`).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem gives two crucial rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereochemistry:** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the point of attack (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regiochemistry):**\n*   We compare the steric hindrance at the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it's bonded to a methyl group.\n*   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, as it's bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n*   The methyl group on C1 makes it significantly more crowded than C6. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. A subsequent workup step protonates the oxygen (now on C1) to form an alcohol (-OH).\n*   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexanol. To name it correctly, the carbon with the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes the new C2.\n*   The substituents on the product are:\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group on the new C1.\n    *   The newly added methyl group on the new C2.\n    *   The original methyl group from C4 is now on the new C4.\n    *   The original methyl group from C3 is now on the new C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n*   **At C2 (the site of attack, original C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration. The starting material was `(6S)`. Inversion of S gives R. So, the product is **(2R)**.\n*   **At C1, C4, C5 (original C1, C4, C3):** These chiral centers are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are retained.\n    *   Original `(1R)` remains **(1R)**.\n    *   Original `(4R)` remains **(4R)**.\n    *   Original `(3R)` becomes **(5R)** after renumbering.\n*   Putting it all together, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   The derived product name and stereochemistry, `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]` system indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` indicates the CH2 of the cyclopropane is replaced by an oxygen, forming an epoxide across the C1-C6 bond of the cyclohexane.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given stereodescriptors are (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to understand the 3D structure this name represents. We can draw a 2D representation of the molecule viewed from the top. The epoxide ring creates a rigid `cis`-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is \"up\" (represented by wedges).\n    *   To satisfy the given R/S assignments, we can deduce the orientation of the substituents:\n        *   **Epoxide:** The C1-O and C6-O bonds are \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   **At C1 (1R):** The methyl group must be \"down\" (dash).\n        *   **At C6 (6S):** The hydrogen atom must be \"down\" (dash).\n        *   **At C3 (3R):** The methyl group must be \"down\" (dash), and the hydrogen \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   **At C4 (4R):** The methyl group must be \"down\" (dash), and the hydrogen \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The epoxide is reacted with `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent), followed by a proton source (implied workup).\n*   **Mechanism:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that open epoxides via an SN2-like mechanism. Key rules for this reaction are:\n    1.  The nucleophile (in this case, `Me-`) attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon.\n    3.  The attack happens from the side opposite to the C-O bond, leading to **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    4.  The resulting alkoxide is protonated during workup to form an alcohol (-OH).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n\n*   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6. The nucleophile `Me-` can attack either carbon.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group.\n*   **C6** is substituted with only a hydrogen atom.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The `Me-` nucleophile attacks C6 from the \"down\" side (anti to the \"up\" C6-O bond). This causes the C6-O bond to break and results in an inversion of configuration at C6.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The original configuration at C6 was (S). Inversion leads to an (R) configuration at this carbon. The original H atom at C6 was \"down\", so it becomes \"up\". The new methyl group is added to the \"down\" position.\n*   **Formation of Alcohol at C1:** The C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks, with the electrons moving to the oxygen, forming an alkoxide. This alkoxide is then protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not inverted because the bond broken is C1-O, not a bond to a substituent on the chiral center itself. The new C1-OH bond will be in the same position as the original C1-O bond, i.e., \"up\".\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their spatial arrangement of atoms is preserved.\n\n**5. Name the Product and Verify Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group at the original C1 position.\n    *   A new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n    *   The original methyl groups at the C3 and C4 positions.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. To give the substituents the lowest locant set, we number the ring clockwise from the new C1.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   New C2 = Old C6\n    *   New C3 = Old C5\n    *   New C4 = Old C4\n    *   New C5 = Old C3\n    *   New C6 = Old C2\n    The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Final Stereochemistry Determination (Logical Transformation):** We can determine the configuration of each stereocenter in the product by considering how it's transformed from the starting material.\n    *   **Product C1:** Corresponds to reactant C1. The configuration is preserved. Reactant C1 is (R), so product C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Product C2:** Corresponds to reactant C6. The configuration is inverted. Reactant C6 is (S), so product C2 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Product C4:** Corresponds to reactant C4. The configuration is preserved. Reactant C4 is (R), so product C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Product C5:** Corresponds to reactant C3. The configuration is preserved. Reactant C3 is (R), so product C5 is **(R)**.\n    *(Note: Preservation of configuration (e.g., R -> R) holds because the relative CIP priorities of the substituents around the chiral center do not change upon renumbering the ring for the product.)*\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe reaction in question is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me₂CuLi). To determine the correct product, we must apply the established rules for this type of reaction regarding regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### **1. Regioselectivity: Site of Attack**\n\nOrganocuprates are soft nucleophiles that react with epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. A key principle of these reactions is that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a tertiary center, as it is bonded to three other carbon atoms (C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is a secondary center, bonded to two other carbon atoms (C1 and C5).\n\nGiven the lower steric hindrance at C6, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from the Gilman reagent will selectively attack this position. This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\nThis regioselectivity leads to a product with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the original C1, and a new methyl group on the original C6. The resulting skeleton is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options C and D, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1 position.\n\n### **2. Stereoselectivity: Inversion of Configuration**\n\nThe Sₙ2-like mechanism of epoxide opening by organocuprates involves a backside attack by the nucleophile, which results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at carbon C6.\n*   The problem states that the initial configuration of C6 is (S).\n*   The reaction causes an inversion of this configuration. Therefore, the resulting stereocenter at this position will have an (R) configuration.\n\n### **3. Product Structure and IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\nWe must now determine the IUPAC name for the resulting stereoisomer.\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the original C1) is designated as C1 in the final product.\n*   The numbering of the cyclohexane ring proceeds to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The next substituent is the newly added methyl group at the adjacent carbon (the original C6), so this becomes C2.\n*   The stereocenter that was attacked (original C6) is now C2 in the product.\n*   Since the configuration at C6 inverted from (S) to (R), the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\nLooking at the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOnly option A has the required (2R) configuration at the C2 position. The other stereocenters, (1R, 4R, 5R), are consistent with the original reactant's stereochemistry, as they are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe reaction involves the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate (Gilman reagent). To determine the product, we must consider the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n    *   The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**:\n    *   The user prompt correctly states that when saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group attached, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**, the less hindered position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure**:\n    *   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an acidic workup step (which is standard procedure).\n    *   A new methyl group is added to C6.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions C1, C3, C4, and the new one at C6.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the primary functional group (the -OH) receives the lowest possible number, so it is designated as the new C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants.\n        *   Old C1 (with OH and Me) becomes New C1.\n        *   Old C6 (with the new Me) becomes New C2.\n        *   Old C5 becomes New C3.\n        *   Old C4 (with a Me) becomes New C4.\n        *   Old C3 (with a Me) becomes New C5.\n    *   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This structural name eliminates options B and D, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The prompt also correctly states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n        *   The configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C3 remains **R**. In the final product name, this corresponds to C5, so C5 is **R**.\n    *   The reaction occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **S**. Due to the Sₙ2 attack, this center undergoes inversion.\n    *   In most cases, a geometric inversion of a chiral center leads to an inversion of its Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) descriptor. While exceptions exist if the substituent priorities change in a specific way, the general rule is that inversion means S becomes R and R becomes S.\n    *   Applying this rule, the S configuration at C6 inverts to an **R** configuration at the corresponding carbon in the product (which is the new C2).\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. The fusion is `cis`. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen points \"up\" (beta face).\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4. A hydrogen is at C6.\n*   **Stereochemistry from the name:**\n    *   The problem provides the absolute configuration of all stereocenters. We don't need to determine them from scratch, but we must use them to understand the reaction's outcome. The key stereocenters for the reaction are the epoxide carbons: C1 (R) and C6 (S).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon where the nucleophile adds. This is a characteristic Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon center (bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon center (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more sterically hindered than C6 due to the presence of the methyl group.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Numbering**\n\n*   The Me⁻ attacks C6, and the C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after protonation during workup, becomes an -OH group.\n*   The original cyclohexane C-C framework remains intact.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. It has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6. The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring from C1 towards the original C6.\n    *   Product C1 = Reactant C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   Product C2 = Reactant C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   Product C3 = Reactant C5\n    *   Product C4 = Reactant C4 (has -Me)\n    *   Product C5 = Reactant C3 (has -Me)\n    *   Product C6 = Reactant C2\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2-dimethyl implies attack at C1).\n\n**5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Untouched Centers:** The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 of the reactant are not involved in the bond-breaking/forming part of the reaction. Their configurations are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 is (R) → Product C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   Reactant C4 is (R) → Product C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   Reactant C3 is (R) → Product C5 is **(R)**.\n*   **Center of Attack:** The stereocenter at C6 undergoes Sₙ2 attack, leading to **inversion of configuration**.\n    *   Reactant C6 has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   The attack by Me⁻ inverts the stereocenter. We need to determine if the resulting configuration at product C2 is R or S.\n    *   This is not a simple S → R flip because the substituents, and thus their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities, change. The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, and the incoming group is methyl.\n    *   Let's analyze the transformation. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the face opposite the C6-O bond. This is an `anti` attack. The original substituent at C6 (a hydrogen) and the other ring connections are pushed to the opposite side (a Walden inversion).\n    *   Given the starting configuration C6(S), a rigorous analysis of the geometry before and after inversion (considering the change in CIP priorities where O is replaced by Me) shows that the new stereocenter at C2 in the product has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   [Detailed check: Priorities at C6(reactant): O > C1 > C5 > H. With a standard representation, C6(S) means H is anti to the C6-O bond. After inversion, the new Me group takes this anti position, and H moves. Priorities at C2(product): C1 > C5 > Me > H. The inverted geometry with the new priority order results in an (S) assignment.]\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   Combining the stereochemical results:\n    *   C1 is (R)\n    *   C2 is (S)\n    *   C4 is (R)\n    *   C5 is (R)\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent, R₂CuLi) is a well-established method for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **Epoxide:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide bridge connects carbons C1 and C6. C1 has a methyl substituent, while C6 has a hydrogen.\n    *   **Organocuprate:** Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are sterically sensitive nucleophiles. The provided information and general principles of organic chemistry state that the nucleophile will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent will attack at this position.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction. This has two important stereochemical consequences:\n    *   **Inversion of Configuration:** The stereocenter at the site of attack undergoes an inversion of its configuration. The starting material has an (S) configuration at C6. The backside attack will invert this center to an (R) configuration in the product.\n    *   **Retention of Configuration:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their original configuration. Thus, the configurations at C1 (1R), C3 (3R), and C4 (4R) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Substitution Pattern:** The nucleophilic attack of a methyl group at C6 of the bicycloheptane ring opens the epoxide. The C6-O bond breaks, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This results in a cyclohexanol derivative with the following substituents based on the original ring numbering:\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group on C1.\n    *   A new methyl group on C6.\n    *   A methyl group on C3.\n    *   A methyl group on C4.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** To name the final product, the ring is renumbered according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols.\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group receives the highest priority and is designated C1 of the product. This corresponds to C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants. Numbering from C1 (original) towards C6 (original) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This numbering scheme {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than the alternative {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Therefore, the product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n3.  **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** Configuration is retained from the reactant (1R). So, the product is (1R).\n    *   **C2:** This is the original C6. The configuration is inverted from (6S) to (R). So, the product is (2R).\n    *   **C4:** This is the original C4. The configuration is retained (4R). So, the product is (4R).\n    *   **C5:** This is the original C3. The configuration is retained (3R). So, the product is (5R).\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is also substituted with a methyl group.\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion ('Me⁻').\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The reaction is a nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and undergo SN2-type reactions.\n*   The key rule for this reaction is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, Oxygen, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, Oxygen, and a hydrogen).\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**. The C6-O bond will break, and the C1-O bond will cleave to form an alcohol at C1 after acidic workup.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The attack follows an **SN2 mechanism**, which means it proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The attack of the methyl group occurs at C6 from the side opposite the epoxide's oxygen atom.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **S**. Due to the SN2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become **R**.\n*   The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged (**3R** and **4R**).\n*   The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds attached directly to the C1 chiral center are broken. Thus, the configuration at C1 is retained as **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring, resulting in a cyclohexanol derivative.\n*   The substituents on the product ring are:\n    *   An -OH group and a -Me group at the original C1.\n    *   A new -Me group (from the cuprate) at the original C6.\n    *   The original -Me groups at C3 and C4.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the ring. The carbon with the -OH group is assigned as C1. To give the other methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring clockwise.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Old C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Old C5\n    *   New C4 = Old C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Old C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Old C2\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the Absolute Configurations to the Product**\n*   We map the configurations from our analysis onto the new numbering system:\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6): Configuration is inverted from S to **R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the stereochemical outcome of the reaction between\n    (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and Me2CuLi.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

The carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6. The cyclohexane ring provides the rest of the bicyclic system.\n*   We need to determine the stereochemistry of all chiral centers based on the given name. We can draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring to assign the stereochemistry using wedge (up, β) and dash (down, α) bonds.\n\nLet's assign the stereochemistry for each center:\n1.  **C6 (6S):** C6 is part of the epoxide. The groups are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, -H. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. To have an 'S' configuration, we must place the lowest priority group (H) in a way that the sequence O → C1 → C5 is counter-clockwise (or clockwise if H is pointing towards the viewer). If we assume the epoxide oxygen is **down (dash)**, the hydrogen at C6 must be **up (wedge)**. Viewing with H pointing towards us, the sequence O → C1 → C5 is clockwise, which correctly gives an S configuration. So, the epoxide is on the α-face (down).\n2.  **C1 (1R):** C1 has a methyl group. The groups are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, -CH₃. The CIP priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH₃. The oxygen is down (dash). To get an R configuration, with the lowest priority group (CH₃) in the back (down, dash), the sequence O → C6 → C2 must be clockwise. This is the case. Therefore, the methyl group at C1 is **down (dash, α)**.\n3.  **C4 (4R):** C4 has a methyl group. The priorities are C3 > C5 > CH₃ > H (C3 is higher priority than C5 because C3 will be attached to a methyl group). To have an R configuration, with H in the back (down, dash), the sequence C3 → C5 → CH₃ must be clockwise. This is achieved if the methyl group is **up (wedge, β)**.\n4.  **C3 (3R):** C3 has a methyl group. The priorities are C4 > C2 > CH₃ > H (C4 is higher priority than C2 because C4 has a methyl group). To have an R configuration, with H in the back (down, dash), the sequence C4 → C2 → CH₃ must be clockwise. This is achieved if the methyl group is **up (wedge, β)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide: down (α)\n*   1-Methyl: down (α)\n*   3-Methyl: up (β)\n*   4-Methyl: up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of attack.**\n*   The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the \"soft\" nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and two ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a hydrogen and two ring carbons.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at this position.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the reaction.**\n*   The reaction is an Sɴ2-type ring opening. The problem states that **inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added**.\n*   The C6-O bond of the epoxide is pointing **down (α)**.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the opposite side, which is the **up (β) face**.\n*   The original stereocenter at C6 had a configuration of **S**. Due to the inversion, the new stereocenter at C6 in the product will have an **R** configuration.\n*   The attack opens the ring by breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is unchanged, as are the stereocenters at C3 and C4.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\nLet's assemble the product structure based on the analysis:\n*   A cyclohexane ring is formed.\n*   At C1 (original numbering): An -OH group pointing down (α) and a -CH₃ group pointing down (α). The configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   At C6 (original numbering): The new methyl group from the cuprate is pointing **up (β)**. The original hydrogen is pushed down (α). The configuration has inverted from S to **R**.\n*   At C3 (original numbering): The methyl group remains **up (β)**. The configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   At C4 (original numbering): The methyl group remains **up (β)**. The configuration is retained as **R**.\n\nNow, we need to name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the parent name is **cyclohexanol**. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring starting from C1 to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Let's check the two possible numbering directions from our C1 (the original C1).\n    *   Numbering clockwise (C1 → original C2 → original C3...): The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1,3,4,6}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise (C1 → original C6 → original C5...): The methyl groups are at C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3). The locant set is {1,2,4,5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1,3,4,6} and {1,2,4,5}, the latter is lower. So, the correct numbering is counter-clockwise.\n3.  **Full Name:** The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to the product.**\nUsing the correct IUPAC numbering (New C1=Old C1, New C2=Old C6, New C4=Old C4, New C5=Old C3):\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **1R** configuration.\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted from S to R. So, the product has a **2R** configuration.\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **4R** configuration.\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was R. So, the product has a **5R** configuration.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the result with the given options.**\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Matches our derived product perfectly.**\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It should be 2R, not 2S.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\n**Detailed Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This name describes a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` part is cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), which is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   As stated in the problem, organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and prefer to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. This is a key principle for regioselectivity.\n    *   The mechanism is an S_N2-type reaction, which means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken. This leads to an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure and Regioselectivity:**\n    *   Let's visualize the epoxide. It's a cyclohexene oxide derivative. The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it has two hydrogens in the parent cyclohexane, one of which is part of the cyclohexane ring skeleton).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. The methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Attack:**\n    *   The attack on C6 follows an S_N2 mechanism, causing an **inversion of configuration** at C6.\n    *   Let's determine the initial configuration of C6. The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-...`. So, C6 has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Due to the S_N2 attack, the stereocenter at C6 will invert. An (S) center will become an (R) center (assuming the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities of the substituents don't change in a way that would retain the S descriptor despite geometric inversion, which is unlikely here).\n    *   The C-O bond at C6 is broken, and a new C-C bond is formed with the incoming methyl group. The C-O bond at C1 is also cleaved, and upon acidic workup (implied in these reactions), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is opened at the C6-O bond.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   An -OH group is formed at C1.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n6.  **Name the Product and Determine Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **Numbering:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon it is attached to (the original C1) is the new C1. To get the lowest locants for the methyl groups, we number the ring counter-clockwise: C1 -> C6(old) -> C5(old) -> C4(old) -> C3(old).\n        *   The methyls are at C1 (original), C2 (newly added), C4 (original), and C5 (from original C3).\n        *   The product is a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This eliminates options B and D.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:**\n        *   The configuration at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) is retained.\n        *   The configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n        *   Let's translate the old configurations to the new numbering:\n            *   Original C1 (1R) -> New C1. Configuration is **(1R)**.\n            *   Original C6 (6S) -> New C2. Configuration inverts to **(2R)**.\n            *   Original C4 (4R) -> New C4. Configuration is **(4R)**.\n            *   Original C3 (3R) -> New C5. Configuration is **(5R)**.\n        *   The complete stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)**.\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   The product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Based on established principles of reactivity, we can determine the resulting product by following a logical sequence of steps.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism:**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The given R/S descriptors define its specific three-dimensional structure.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon atom. In the given bicyclic system, the epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms), making it highly hindered. C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three non-hydrogen atoms and one hydrogen), which is significantly less hindered. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism, which results in a \"backside attack\". This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the carbon-oxygen bond, leading to an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Course of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting material has an S configuration at C6. Due to the Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile, this center will undergo inversion, resulting in an R configuration in the product.\n*   **Retention at Other Centers:** The reaction does not involve breaking or forming bonds at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4). Therefore, their absolute configurations remain unchanged. C1 stays R, C3 stays R, and C4 stays R. Note that while the 3D arrangement at C1 is unchanged, its R/S descriptor could theoretically change if the priority of its neighboring groups changes. However, a detailed analysis shows the priority order of the substituents around C1 does not change, thus it remains R.\n\n**3. Structure and Nomenclature of the Product:**\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond, opening the epoxide ring. Subsequent protonation (assumed in the workup step) of the resulting alkoxide at C1 yields a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Renaming:** The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered towards the newly added methyl group. This leads to the following correspondence between the old and new numbering:\n    *   Old C1 → New C1 (has -OH and a methyl group)\n    *   Old C6 → New C2 (has the newly added methyl group)\n    *   Old C4 → New C4 (has a methyl group)\n    *   Old C3 → New C5 (has a methyl group)\n*   **Final Product Name:** Based on the retention and inversion of stereocenters, the product's configuration is:\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1) remains **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6) inverts from S to **R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4) remains **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3) remains **R**.\n\nCombining these elements, the final product is identified as **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe analysis of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi) is based on well-established principles of organocuprate chemistry.\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type**: The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group. Gilman reagents are known to react with epoxides in a ring-opening reaction that forms a new carbon-carbon bond. This reaction is mechanistically similar to an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt and chemical literature confirm that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of an unsymmetrical epoxide. In the given bicyclic epoxide, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 bears a methyl group, making it a more substituted and sterically hindered position. C6, while part of the bicyclic system, does not have an additional alkyl substituent. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond. This backside attack results in an inversion of the configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration. The inversion of configuration will change it to (R).\n    *   The configuration at C1, which is (R), is not attacked and remains unchanged. This carbon will bear the resulting hydroxyl group.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters, C3 (R) and C4 (R), are also unaffected by the reaction.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after workup (which is implied), an alcohol is formed at C1.\n    *   The original cyclohexane ring now has four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the hydroxyl group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 remains C1 in the product.\n    *   The carbon that was attacked (C6) is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2. The other carbons are numbered around the ring. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   The final product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **C1**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (1R, ...).\n    *   **C2 (from C6)**: Undergoes inversion from (S) to (R). The product is (..., 2R, ...).\n    *   **C4 (from C4)**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (..., 4R, ...).\n    *   **C5 (from C3)**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (..., 5R).\n\nCombining these determines the final product's stereochemistry as (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R). This corresponds to option D.\n\nTherefore, the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me₂CuLi yields (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), with an epoxide is a cornerstone of organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereochemistry of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three other carbons and an oxygen), and it bears a methyl group. C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to two other carbons and an oxygen).\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, in this case, a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In this molecule, C6 is a secondary carbon, while C1 is a tertiary carbon with a methyl group. Therefore, C6 is the less hindered site, and it is where the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction proceeds through a backside attack, characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction. This results in the inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked. The configurations of the other stereocenters in the molecule, which are not directly involved in the ring-opening, are retained.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n1.  **Site of Attack:** The incoming methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered C6 of the epoxide.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The attack breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (an implicit step to neutralize the intermediate), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The stereocenter at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material, undergoes inversion to become (R) in the product.\n    *   The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not part of the reaction and retain their original configurations: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:**\n    *   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The hydroxyl group is on C1 (from the reactant), which also has a methyl group. The newly added methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, C2 (originally C6). The other original methyl groups are now at positions C4 and C5 based on standard IUPAC numbering for the cyclohexanol product.\n    *   The final structure is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   Let's map the stereochemistry to the new name:\n        *   **C1:** Retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   **C2 (from C6):** Inverts from (S) to (R).\n        *   **C4 (from C4):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   **C5 (from C3):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the full IUPAC name of the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: This describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The numbers [4.1.0] indicate that the bridgehead carbons (let's call them C1 and C6) are connected by a path of 4 carbons (C2-C3-C4-C5), a path of 1 carbon (which is actually the other side of the epoxide, but this notation means a 3-membered ring is fused to a 6-membered ring), and a bridge of 0 atoms. The `7-oxa` means atom 7, which is part of the three-membered ring, is an oxygen.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\n*   **Drawing the structure:** We can represent the cyclohexane ring as a planar hexagon with wedges (bonds coming out of the plane, up/beta) and dashes (bonds going into the plane, down/alpha) to show the 3D arrangement.\n    *   From the stereodescriptors (1R, 6S), we can deduce that the epoxide ring and the substituents on the bridgehead carbons (C1-Me and C6-H) are on opposite faces of the cyclohexane ring. We will place the bulky epoxide ring 'up' (beta, wedge). This forces the C1-Me group and the C6-H to be 'down' (alpha, dash).\n    *   For C3 to be R (3R) and C4 to be R (4R), with their respective hydrogens in the back (alpha/dash), the methyl groups at C3 and C4 must both be 'up' (beta, wedge).\n\n*   **Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:**\n    *   Epoxide ring: up (beta, wedged bonds from C1 and C6 to O).\n    *   Methyl group at C1: down (alpha, dashed bond).\n    *   Hydrogen at C6: down (alpha, dashed bond).\n    *   Methyl group at C3: up (beta, wedged bond).\n    *   Methyl group at C4: up (beta, wedged bond).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n*   **Key Principles (as stated in the problem):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **Hindrance at C1:** C1 is a *quaternary* carbon, bonded to a methyl group in addition to the three ring carbons (C2, C6, O). Backside attack (required for Sₙ2) on the C1-O bond would have to come from the 'down' (alpha) face, which is sterically blocked by the axial-like methyl group at C1.\n*   **Hindrance at C6:** C6 is a *tertiary* carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom. Backside attack on the C6-O bond would also come from the 'down' (alpha) face, where it would encounter the axial-like hydrogen at C6.\n*   **Conclusion:** A hydrogen atom is much smaller than a methyl group. Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and it will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Attack:** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6 from the 'down' (alpha) face.\n*   **Bond breaking/formation:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains.\n*   **Inversion:** The configuration at C6 is inverted. The original H at C6 (alpha, down) is pushed 'up' (beta). The incoming methyl group attaches to the 'down' (alpha) face of C6.\n*   **Workup:** The resulting alkoxide at C1 is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was 'up', the -OH group will also be 'up' (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product's substituents:**\n    *   At `old C1`: -OH is up (beta), -Me is down (alpha).\n    *   At `old C6`: New -Me is down (alpha), -H is up (beta).\n    *   At `old C3`: -Me is up (beta), -H is down (alpha).\n    *   At `old C4`: -Me is up (beta), -H is down (alpha).\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. We need to number the ring according to IUPAC rules.\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (where `new C2` = `old C6`, `new C4` = `old C4`, `new C5` = `old C3`).\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred over {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   So, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration for the Product:** We now determine the absolute configuration at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. We use the planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down).\n\n    *   **C1:**\n        *   Priorities: -OH (1) > C2 (has Me) > C6 > -Me (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-Me) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence OH → C2 → C6 is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C1 is R**.\n\n    *   **C2 (old C6):**\n        *   Priorities: C1 (has OH) > C3 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'up' (front).\n        *   The sequence C1 → C3 → -Me is **counter-clockwise**.\n        *   Since H is in the front, we reverse the result: counter-clockwise becomes clockwise.\n        *   Therefore, **C2 is R**.\n\n    *   **C4 (old C4):**\n        *   Priorities: C5 (has Me) > C3 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence C5 → C3 → -Me is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C4 is R**.\n\n    *   **C5 (old C3):**\n        *   Priorities: C4 (has Me) > C6 > -Me > -H (4).\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H) is 'down' (back).\n        *   The sequence C4 → C6 → -Me is **clockwise**.\n        *   Therefore, **C5 is R**.\n\n*   The final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemistry, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n**1. Understanding the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` means the bridging atom (C7) of the cyclopropane is an oxygen, which makes this an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The molecule has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is explicitly given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Key Principles of the Reaction**\n\nThere are two fundamental rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the epoxide at the carbon atom that is **less sterically hindered**.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-type mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Applying the Principles to the Problem**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide ring consists of carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and is bonded to C2 and C6.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom and is bonded to C1 and C5.\n    *   Comparing the steric hindrance, C6 (bearing a hydrogen) is significantly less hindered than C1 (bearing a methyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the stereochemical outcome (Stereospecificity).**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6 and causes an inversion of its stereochemical configuration.\n    *   The starting material's name tells us that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   Due to the SN2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n        *   Configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   Configuration at C3 remains **(R)**.\n        *   Configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring. Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group (the old C1) is designated as C1 in the final product's IUPAC name.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The nucleophilic methyl group added to the old C6. This carbon is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2.\n        *   New C1 corresponds to Old C1.\n        *   New C2 corresponds to Old C6.\n        *   New C4 corresponds to Old C4.\n        *   New C5 corresponds to Old C3.\n    *   The product is named `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This eliminates options C and D which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the final stereochemistry to the product name.**\n    *   We map the configurations from our analysis onto the new numbering system:\n        *   **C1 (old C1):** Retains its configuration -> **(1R)**\n        *   **C2 (old C6):** Inverts its configuration (S -> R) -> **(2R)**\n        *   **C4 (old C4):** Retains its configuration -> **(4R)**\n        *   **C5 (old C3):** Retains its configuration -> **(5R)**\n    *   Combining these gives the full name of the product: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Our derived name matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups at these positions.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute 3D arrangement.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem states two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure of the Starting Epoxide\n\nLet's visualize the 3D structure from the IUPAC name. The epoxide fusion is cis, so we'll place it on the top (β) face of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **At C1 (R):** For C1 to be (R), the methyl group must be on the bottom (α) face.\n*   **At C6 (S):** For C6 to be (S), the hydrogen must be on the bottom (α) face.\n*   **At C3 (R) and C4 (R):** The methyl groups at these positions are on the top (β) face, on the same side as the epoxide oxygen.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regiochemistry)\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen).\n*   The general rule provided suggests an attack at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n*   **Critically, we must check the given answer choices.** An attack at C6 would place a new methyl group at C6 and form an alcohol at C1, leading to a `1,3,4,6-tetramethylcyclohexanol` product. None of the options (A, B, C, D) have this carbon skeleton.\n*   Options A and C have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` skeleton. A gem-dimethyl (`2,2-`) group can only be formed if the nucleophilic methyl attacks the carbon that already has a methyl group. In our substrate, this is **C1**.\n*   Therefore, we must conclude that the reaction proceeds via attack at the **more hindered carbon, C1**. This is a known exception to the general rule, often occurring when other parts of the molecule (like the β-methyl groups at C3 and C4) make the supposedly \"less hindered\" C6 site inaccessible.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Product from C1 Attack\n\n1.  **Attack:** The nucleophile `Me⁻` attacks C1. The reaction follows Sₙ2 stereochemistry.\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The C1-O bond is \"up\" (β). The attack must come from the opposite side, which is the \"down\" (α) face. The incoming methyl group will therefore add to the α face.\n3.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C6 and, after an aqueous workup, becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C6-O bond was \"up\" (β), the resulting -OH group is also \"up\" (β).\n4.  **Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The original C1 carbon now has two methyl groups: the original α-methyl and the newly added α-methyl.\n    *   The OH group is at the C6 position, pointing up (β).\n    *   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unaffected and remain up (β).\n\n### 5. Name the Product and Determine Its Stereochemistry\n\nWe must re-number the ring according to IUPAC rules, giving the -OH group the highest priority (locant 1).\n\n*   **Numbering:** The carbon with the OH group (the old C6) becomes the new **C1**. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise. The carbon with the two methyls (the old C1) becomes the new **C2**. The old C3 becomes the new **C4**, and the old C4 becomes the new **C5**. The name is **2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This confirms we are looking for either option A or C.\n\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry of the Chiral Centers (C1, C4, C5):**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C6):** This carbon has an -OH (up, β), an H (down, α), and is attached to C2 (the gem-dimethyl carbon) and C6. Priorities are: OH > C2 > C6 > H. With the lowest priority group (H) pointing away, we trace the path from OH → C2 → C6. This path is **clockwise**. Therefore, the configuration at C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C3):** This center was not involved in the reaction. Its original configuration was **(R)**, and it remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C4):** This center was also not involved in the reaction. Its original configuration was **(R)**, and it remains **(R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product:** The product is **(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived product with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The \"7-oxa\" indicates that the CH₂ group of the cyclopropane (at position 7) is replaced by an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6. These are the two carbons of the epoxide ring that can be attacked.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The problem explicitly states a key rule for this reaction: \"When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   We must determine which one is less hindered.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (in addition to being part of the ring). This makes it a tertiary carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C6 has no substituent other than a hydrogen atom (and being part of the ring). This makes it a secondary carbon of the epoxide.\n*   Comparing a tertiary carbon (C1) to a secondary carbon (C6), C6 is clearly the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\n*   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs from the backside of the C-O bond.\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the stereocenter at C6 will undergo inversion. The initial configuration is 6S, so the product will have an R configuration at this carbon.\n*   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-making or bond-breaking (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their relative spatial arrangement. We assume their absolute configuration R/S designation will also be retained, but we will verify this later if needed.\n\n**4. Predict the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Reaction Path:**\n    1.  The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6.\n    2.  The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom.\n    3.  This opens the epoxide ring, forming a lithium alkoxide where the oxygen is still attached to C1.\n    4.  A subsequent workup step (implied, usually with water) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   **Resulting Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n    *   At the position of original C1: one -OH group and one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C3: one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C4: one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C6: the newly added -Me group.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) receives the lowest possible number, which is **C1**.\n    2.  We number the rest of the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Starting at the new C1 and numbering clockwise towards the original C6 position: Me groups are at C1, C2 (from old C6), C4 (from old C4), and C5 (from old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Starting at the new C1 and numbering counter-clockwise towards the original C2 position: Me groups are at C1, C3 (from old C3), C4 (from old C4), and C6 (from old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the two sets {1,2,4,5} and {1,3,4,6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). So, the correct numbering gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the naming in options A and D.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   We need to find the configuration (R or S) of the chiral centers in the product: new C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   We trace the configuration from the reactant to the product based on the numbering we just established:\n    *   **New C2 comes from old C6:** The reaction at this center causes inversion of configuration. Reactant C6 is S, so product C2 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C1 comes from old C1:** This center is not attacked, so its 3D arrangement is preserved. The R/S designation depends on substituent priorities. In both reactant (C1 bonded to O, C6, C2, Me) and product (C1 bonded to OH, C2, C6, Me), the priority order of the four groups remains the same (O/OH > C-neighbor with more Me > C-neighbor with fewer Me > Me). Therefore, the configuration is retained. Reactant C1 is R, so product C1 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C4 comes from old C4:** This center is remote from the reaction site. Its configuration is retained. Reactant C4 is R, so product C4 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C5 comes from old C3:** This center is also remote. Its configuration is retained. Reactant C3 is R, so product C5 will be **R**.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry:** Combining these findings, the product has the configuration (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Based on the established principles of such reactions, two key rules apply:\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down the transformation step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Identify the epoxide carbons and determine the site of attack**: The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" indicates a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused at positions C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Determine the stereochemical outcome**:\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (6S) as given in the name.\n    *   Due to the SN2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted. Thus, the S configuration becomes R.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction, as no bonds are broken or formed at these positions.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure and IUPAC name of the product**:\n    *   The nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide. Subsequent workup with water protonates the resulting alkoxide at C1, forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group receives the highest priority and is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The adjacent carbon, which was attacked (originally C6), is now C2.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n4.  **Assign the stereochemistry to the product**:\n    *   **C1**: The configuration is retained from the starting material. Original C1 was (1R), so the product is (1R).\n    *   **C2**: This was originally C6. Its configuration inverts from (6S) to (2R).\n    *   **C4**: This was originally C3. Its configuration is retained as (3R), which corresponds to (4R) in the new numbering system.\n    *   **C5**: This was originally C4. Its configuration is retained as (4R), which corresponds to (5R) in the new numbering system.\n\nCombining these assignments gives the full name of the product as **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe user has provided a specific chemical reaction and asked to identify the product from a list of options.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic epoxide. The core structure is a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. C1 is also substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary center. C6 is a tertiary center. The stereochemistry of the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is specified.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate). This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The problem statement correctly notes that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Comparing the two epoxide carbons, C1 is more hindered (quaternary, substituted with a methyl group and part of two rings) than C6 (tertiary, part of two rings). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack of Me⁻ occurs at C6.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens, and upon acidic workup (which is standard for these reactions), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexane ring will be:\n        *   At the original C1 position: a hydroxyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C3 position: a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C4 position: a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C6 position: a new methyl group from the Gilman reagent.\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) is designated as **new C1**.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the new C1, and at positions corresponding to the original C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Let's trace the numbering from the new C1.\n        *   Path A (going toward original C2): Substituents at new C1(Me), new C3(Me, from original C3), new C4(Me, from original C4), and new C6(Me, from original C6). This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Path B (going toward original C6): Substituents at new C1(Me), new C2(Me, from original C6), new C4(Me, from original C4), and new C5(Me, from original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1, 3, 4, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5}, the latter is lower according to IUPAC rules.\n    *   Therefore, the product's systematic name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The configurations of the stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction remain unchanged. The center that is attacked undergoes inversion.\n    *   Original stereochemistry: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n    *   Let's map the old centers to the new numbering ({1,2,4,5} pattern):\n        *   **New C1** corresponds to **Original C1**. Its configuration is retained. So, it remains **R**. Product has (1R).\n        *   **New C2** corresponds to **Original C6**. This carbon was attacked, so its configuration inverts. It was S, so it becomes **R**. Product has (2R).\n        *   **New C4** corresponds to **Original C4**. Its configuration is retained. So, it remains **R**. Product has (4R).\n        *   **New C5** corresponds to **Original C3**. Its configuration is retained. So, it remains **R**. Product has (5R).\n    *   Combining these, the final product's stereochemistry is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi).\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, a Gilman reagent (an organocuprate). This provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that are well-suited for this type of reaction.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity\nThe first rule to consider is where the nucleophile will attack.\n*   For reactions with organocuprates and other strong, unhindered nucleophiles under basic or neutral conditions, the attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a classic Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and two other ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n*   **C6** is a secondary carbon, bonded to two other ring carbons (C1 and C5) and a hydrogen.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry\nThe second rule to consider is the stereochemical outcome of the attack.\n*   The ring-opening of epoxides via an Sₙ2 mechanism involves a backside attack. This means the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group at C6 will invert this center to an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The C-O bond at C1 will open and, after an aqueous workup, will form an alcohol (-OH). The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Product Structure\nBased on the analysis above, the resulting product will be a cyclohexanol with the following features:\n*   **Original C1:** Retains its (R) configuration and now has both a methyl group and a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Original C6:** Is now bonded to a new methyl group and its configuration has inverted from (S) to (R).\n*   **Original C3:** Retains its (R) configuration and methyl group.\n*   **Original C4:** Retains its (R) configuration and methyl group.\n\n### 5. Name the Final Product\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the cyclohexane ring:\n1.  The hydroxyl group (-OH) gets the highest priority, so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) becomes the new **C1**.\n2.  We number the ring to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from new C1 (towards original C2) would place methyl groups at 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from new C1 (towards original C6) places the methyl groups at 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n3.  The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering.\n4.  The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nNow, let's assign the absolute configurations based on the new numbering:\n*   **New C1** (Original C1): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (Original C6): Configuration inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (Original C4): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (Original C3): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n\nCombining the stereodescriptors and the name, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bicyclo numbering scheme means the epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6, which are adjacent in the ring. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" means there are methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   \"(1R,3R,4R,6S)\" specifies the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, \"Me⁻\".\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction Rules to the Specific Substrate**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the resulting structure.**\n    *   Attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The C-O bond at C1 breaks, and upon workup, the oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups were at C1, C3, and C4. A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n    *   To name the product, we use IUPAC nomenclature. The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Following the numbering to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants, the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern that would result from attack at C1.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the product's stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity).**\n    *   The reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the point of attack (C6).\n    *   The starting material's stereochemistry at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) center produces an **(R)** center.\n    *   The configuration at the other epoxide carbon (C1) is **retained**. The starting material is **(1R)**, so this center remains **(1R)** in the product.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C3 and C4) which are not part of the reaction are also retained.\n    *   In the IUPAC name of the product, the original C6 is now C2. So, the product must have a **(2R)** configuration. The original C1 is now C1, so it is **(1R)**.\n    *   We are looking for the product: **(1R, 2R, ...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur analysis shows that the product must have a (2R) configuration due to the inversion at the original (6S) carbon. Option A matches this requirement. Option B would imply retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this reaction. The remote stereocenters (4R, 5R) are also consistent with retention of configuration from the starting material (after renumbering).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe reaction in question involves the opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate, specifically lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), which is also known as a Gilman reagent. To determine the correct product, we must follow the established rules for this type of reaction regarding regioselectivity and stereochemistry, which were also helpfully provided in the problem description.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and O), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to H, C1, C5, and O).\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent). This reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt and general chemical principles state that organocuprates attack the *less sterically hindered* carbon of the epoxide ring. Comparing the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 (tertiary) and C6 (secondary), the C6 position is less hindered. Therefore, the methyl group from the Gilman reagent will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *inversion of configuration* at the carbon being attacked. The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their original configuration.\n    *   **At C6**: The initial configuration is S. The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an R configuration.\n    *   **At C1**: This stereocenter's configuration is R. The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds directly to the chiral carbon C1 are formed or broken in a way that would invert its stereochemistry. Thus, it retains its R configuration. The oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an acidic workup step.\n    *   **At C3 and C4**: These stereocenters are remote from the reaction site and their R configurations will not change.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, we have a new molecule with the following features based on the *original numbering* of the bicyclic system:\n*   An -OH group at C1.\n*   A methyl group at C1 (original).\n*   A methyl group at C3 (original).\n*   A methyl group at C4 (original).\n*   A new methyl group at C6.\n\nTo assign the correct IUPAC name, the resulting cyclohexanol must be re-numbered according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  The carbon bearing the highest priority functional group, the hydroxyl (-OH) group, is assigned as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n2.  The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. We have methyl groups at the new C1 (old C1), old C6, old C3, and old C4.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl substituents at positions 1, 2 (from old C6), 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so this numbering is correct.\n\nThe product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Determining the Product's Stereochemistry\n\nNow, we map the stereochemical configurations to the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (Old C1): Retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **New C2** (Old C6): Inverts from S to **R**.\n*   **New C4** (Old C4): Retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **New C5** (Old C3): Retains its **R** configuration.\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: I will identify the structure of the starting epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and the reagent, Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism**: I will apply the known principles for the reaction of epoxides with organocuprates. The user's prompt correctly states that this is an SN2-like reaction where the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, causing an inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n3.  **Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**: The epoxide is formed across carbons C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane system. I will compare the substitution at these two carbons. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not (it has a hydrogen atom). Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon and will be the site of nucleophilic attack by the methyl group from the Gilman reagent.\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The attack on C6 will proceed with inversion of stereochemistry. The initial configuration at C6 is given as (6S). After inversion, the configuration at this carbon will become R.\n    *   The stereochemical centers not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n5.  **Construct the Product**: I will assemble the final product structure and its stereochemistry based on the analysis.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide becomes a C1-OH group. Its configuration remains (1R).\n    *   The new methyl group attaches to C6, which becomes a stereocenter. Its configuration is inverted from (6S) to R.\n    *   The methyl group at C3 retains its (3R) configuration.\n    *   The methyl group at C4 retains its (4R) configuration.\n6.  **Name the Product**: I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the product, which is a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is numbered C1. The numbering will proceed around the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants. Then, I will assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each stereocenter in the product according to the new numbering.\n    *   Original C1 -> New C1 (retains R config) -> **1R**\n    *   Original C6 -> New C2 (inverts from S to R) -> **2R**\n    *   Original C4 -> New C4 (retains R config) -> **4R**\n    *   Original C3 -> New C5 (retains R config) -> **5R**\n7.  **Select the Correct Answer**: The resulting product will have the stereochemistry (1R,2R,4R,5R).

This matches option B.\nThe correct product is: B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes this framework.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations at the chiral centers are given: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S. We can visualize this with the epoxide ring situated on the \"top\" (beta or wedged) face of the cyclohexane ring. The specific configurations of the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are determined by the given R/S assignments. For this analysis, it is sufficient to know their configurations without drawing the exact conformation, as we will rely on the rules of the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\nThe reagent is Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), also known as a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Nucleophile:** This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction with Epoxides:** Organocuprates react with epoxides in an SN2-type nucleophilic substitution reaction to open the epoxide ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\nThe question states a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6, and the oxygen atom.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system. It is a tertiary carbon center (within the hydrocarbon skeleton) and quaternary overall.\n    *   C6 is substituted only with a hydrogen atom (and is part of the ring system). It is a secondary carbon center (within the hydrocarbon skeleton) and tertiary overall.\n*   **Conclusion:** C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) will attack C6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\nThe question provides another key rule: \"In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This is a characteristic feature of an SN2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (which is the epoxide oxygen).\n*   The attack occurs at C6. The original configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the SN2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted. So, the new configuration at this carbon in the product will be (R).\n*   The bonds at the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not broken during this reaction. Therefore, their configurations are retained.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Product Structure and Name**\n*   **Reaction Summary:**\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6, causing inversion from S to R.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide becomes a C1-OH bond after acidic or aqueous workup.\n    *   The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain R.\n*   **Resulting Configurations:**\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C1: Configuration remains **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C6: Configuration inverts from S to **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C3: Configuration remains **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C4: Configuration remains **R**.\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group is assigned as C1 for IUPAC naming. This corresponds to the *original* C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The substituents are now four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group. The methyl groups are on the carbons corresponding to original C1, original C3, original C4, and a new one on original C6.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring starting from the C-OH carbon. We have two choices: clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n        *   If we number clockwise: Methyls would be at 1, original C2 (no Me), original C3, original C4, original C5 (no Me), original C6. Locants: 1, 3, 4, 6.\n        *   If we number counter-clockwise: Methyls would be at 1, original C6, original C5 (no Me), original C4, original C3. Locants: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The set (1, 2, 4, 5) is lower than (1, 3, 4, 6). Thus, the correct IUPAC numbering is counter-clockwise.\n    *   The product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Assigning Stereochemistry to the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   New C1 (was original C1): Configuration is **R**. -> (1R)\n    *   New C2 (was original C6): Configuration is **R**. -> (2R)\n    *   New C4 (was original C4): Configuration is **R**. -> (4R)\n    *   New C5 (was original C3): Configuration is **R**. -> (5R)\n*   **Final Product Name:** Combining the name and stereochemistry gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Result with the Options**\nThe calculated product name (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol matches option B.\n\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Correct)\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern)\nD) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern and stereochemistry)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name:\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me-), although it's delivered as part of the cuprate complex.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles, and their reaction with epoxides is primarily governed by sterics. They attack the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   Let's examine the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 and C6:\n        *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being connected to C2 and C6 within the ring and the epoxide oxygen. It is a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogen).\n        *   **C6** is connected to C5 and C1 within the ring, the epoxide oxygen, and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon.\n    *   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more hindered than C6 due to the presence of the methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me-) from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   This backside attack results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   Since the attack is at C6, the stereocenter at C6 will invert its configuration.\n    *   The original configuration of C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   After the reaction, the configuration at this carbon will become **R**.\n    *   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-making steps, so their configurations will be retained.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The attack of Me- on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O-). A subsequent aqueous workup (which is assumed in such problems) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   Let's summarize the changes based on the original numbering:\n        *   An -OH group is now at C1.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C1.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C3.\n        *   A methyl group is still at C4.\n        *   A new methyl group (from the cuprate) is added at C6.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. To name it correctly according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the ring. The carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned as C1. Then, we number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n        *   Let's call the original C1 (now with OH and Me) the \"new C1\".\n        *   The methyl groups are at original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n        *   We can number clockwise (new C1 -> old C2 -> old C3 ...) or counter-clockwise (new C1 -> old C6 -> old C5 ...).\n        *   Numbering counter-clockwise: New C1 (old C1), New C2 (old C6), New C3 (old C5), New C4 (old C4), New C5 (old C3). The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Numbering clockwise: New C1 (old C1), New C2 (old C2), New C3 (old C3). The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3, 4, 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Comparing the sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). Thus, the correct numbering gives the locants 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product's Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   We need to find the configuration (R or S) for the chiral centers in the product, which are at C1, C2, C4, and C5 (in the new numbering system).\n    *   We map the original stereocenters to the new ones and apply the changes:\n        *   **New C1** comes from **Old C1**. Configuration is retained. Original was (1R) -> Product is **(1R)**.\n        *   **New C2** comes from **Old C6**. Configuration is inverted. Original was (6S) -> Product is **(2R)**.\n        *   **New C4** comes from **Old C4**. Configuration is retained. Original was (4R) -> Product is **(4R)**.\n        *   **New C5** comes from **Old C3**. Configuration is retained. Original was (3R) -> Product is **(5R)**.\n    *   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe search results confirm the key principles for the reaction of organocuprates (Gilman reagents) with epoxides.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft, nucleophilic reagents that attack epoxides in an SN2 fashion. This attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which leads to an inversion of configuration at the carbon center being attacked. The overall result is a *trans*-diaxial opening when applied to cyclic systems like cyclohexene oxides.\n\nBased on this, the analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate and Reagent**:\n    *   Substrate: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Reagent: Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**:\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center within the epoxide.\n    *   C6 has no methyl group substituent, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   The nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**:\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type opening. The methyl nucleophile attacks C6 from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   This results in the inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The initial configuration is (6S), so after inversion, it becomes (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction and are retained.\n    *   The epoxide ring opens, and after workup (which is implicit), the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n4.  **Identify and Name the Product**:\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain. A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   To name the product, the ring must be re-numbered according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols. The carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the set {1, 2, 4, 5}. The former C6 is now C2, former C3 is now C5, and former C4 is now C4.\n    *   The product name is therefore 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n5.  **Assign the Stereochemistry to the Product**:\n    *   Configuration at new C1 (old C1) is retained: **(1R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C2 (old C6) is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C4 (old C4) is retained: **(4R)**.\n    *   Configuration at new C5 (old C3) is retained: **(5R)**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis detailed analysis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which has specific consequences for the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of the product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` part of the name indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The oxygen is designated as position 7, and it bridges carbons 1 and 6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4, with the specified R/S configurations.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, or lithium dimethylcuprate. This Gilman reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity of the Reaction:**\nOrganocuprates are considered soft nucleophiles. In reactions with asymmetric epoxides under basic or neutral conditions, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given substrate, the epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, C5, and O7).\n*   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen atom, and O7).\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent will attack at this position.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry of the Reaction:**\nThe reaction proceeds via a backside S_N2 attack. A key characteristic of the S_N2 mechanism is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the substitution occurs.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n*   This causes the C6-O bond to break, and the stereochemical configuration at C6 is inverted.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as (6S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be (R).\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   A new methyl group is added to C6. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated C1. This corresponds to C1 of the reactant. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The nucleophilic attack happened at C6 of the starting material, which becomes C2 in the final product, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereocenters at reactant C3 and C4 are undisturbed and become C5 and C4 in the product, respectively, retaining their 'R' configuration.\n*   The crucial point is the inversion at the site of attack. The C6 carbon of the reactant becomes the C2 carbon of the product, and its configuration inverts from S to R.\n*   Thus, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (1R,2**S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,2**R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOptions C and D have an incorrect substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...). Options A and B have the correct substitution pattern (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl...). The determining factor is the stereochemistry at C2, which must be R due to the inversion of configuration. This eliminates option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bridgehead carbons where the fusion occurs are C1 and C6. The oxygen atom of the epoxide is labeled as atom 7.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to determine the 3D structure. By carefully applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the following structure can be determined:\n    *   The epoxide ring is oriented 'down' (alpha face).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is 'up' (beta face), making it *trans* to the epoxide.\n    *   The hydrogen at C6 is 'up' (beta face), also *trans* to the epoxide.\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is 'up' (beta face).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is 'up' (beta face).\n\nLet's represent this with a 2D drawing with wedges (up) and dashes (down):\n```\n          Me(4, wedge)\n         /\n     --C4(H,dash)--\n    /               \\\n C5(H,H)             C3(H,dash)--Me(3,wedge)\n /                       \\\nC6(H,wedge)-------------C2(H,H)\n \\  (O,dash)   /\n  \\          /\n   C1(Me,wedge)\n     `-. /\n        O\n```\n*Note: This is a complex 3D structure, and its correct assignment is crucial.*\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves backside attack and inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack):** The problem states that the attack occurs at the *less hindered carbon*. Let's examine the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is highly sterically hindered.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a hydrogen, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is significantly less hindered than C1.\n\nBased on the rule provided, the attack should occur at C6. This would lead to a product with a new methyl group at C6 and an OH group at C1. The resulting product would be a **1,3,4,6-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nHowever, none of the options (A, B, C, D) have this substitution pattern. They are either `1,2,4,5-` or `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This strongly suggests that the reaction does not follow the general rule in this specific case, and the attack must occur at the *more hindered* carbon, C1. This type of outcome can happen in complex bicyclic systems or when electronic factors, favoring charge stabilization at the more substituted carbon, override sterics.\n\n**3. The Correct Pathway: Attack at the More Hindered Carbon (C1)**\n\nLet's proceed with the hypothesis that the attack occurs at C1.\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C1.\n*   **Step 2: Stereochemistry of Attack.** The attack is Sₙ2-like. The leaving group is the C1-O bond, which is 'down' (alpha). Therefore, the nucleophile must attack from the 'up' side (beta).\n*   **Step 3: Inversion and Bond Breaking.** The attack from 'up' inverts the configuration at C1, breaking the C1-O bond. The electrons from this bond move to the oxygen atom.\n*   **Step 4: Protonation.** An acid-water workup protonates the resulting alkoxide at C6, forming an alcohol (OH) group.\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\nLet's trace the fate of each part of the molecule.\n\n*   **Numbering Change:** The OH group defines the new C1. So, the old C6 becomes the new C1. The old C1 becomes the new C2, and so on around the ring.\n    *   Reactant C6 → Product C1\n    *   Reactant C1 → Product C2\n    *   Reactant C3 → Product C4\n    *   Reactant C4 → Product C5\n*   **Stereochemistry of Unchanged Centers:**\n    *   The configurations at C3 and C4 are not affected by the reaction. So, Reactant C3(R) becomes Product C4(R), and Reactant C4(R) becomes Product C5(R).\n*   **Stereochemistry at the New OH Carbon (Product C1):**\n    *   This carbon was C6 in the reactant. Its configuration was (6S), with bonds to O(down), H(up), C1, and C5. These bonds (except C6-O) are not broken. The C6-O bond becomes C6-OH. The priorities of the attached groups do not change their order. Therefore, the configuration remains S. The product has a stereocenter at **C1 which is (S)**.\n*   **Stereochemistry at the site of attack (Product C2):**\n    *   This was C1 in the reactant. It had a Me group 'up'. The nucleophilic attack from 'up' inverts the center, pushing the original methyl group 'down'. The carbon is no longer a stereocenter as it becomes a gem-dimethyl group (C(Me)₂).\n*   **Final Product Assembly:**\n    *   The OH group is at C1 (from the 'down' epoxide O at C6).\n    *   The gem-dimethyl group is at C2.\n    *   The Me group at C4 is 'up' (beta).\n    *   The Me group at C5 is 'up' (beta).\n    *   Let's determine the R/S of the final product based on this derived structure.\n        *   **Product C1 (Old C6):** We established its configuration is (S).\n        *   **Product C4 (Old C3):** We established its configuration is (R).\n        *   **Product C5 (Old C4):** We established its configuration is (R).\n    *   So, the predicted product is **(1S, 4R, 5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis prediction does not perfectly match any of the options. Let's reconsider the C1 configuration in the product. While the atom priorities O>C1>C5>H become OH>C2>C6>H, and the order seems preserved, the change from a constrained bicyclic system to a more flexible cyclohexane can alter the 3D arrangement in a way that flips the R/S designation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the product stereochemistry assuming inversion happened, leading to **(1R, 4R, 5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nLet's analyze the reaction that would form this product:\n*   Product Name: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   This name requires that C1 is (R), C4 is (R), and C5 is (R).\n*   The (4R, 5R) part is consistent with our analysis of the spectator centers C3 and C4.\n*   The (1R) requires that the original C6(S) center somehow becomes (R) in the final product. Let's trace this carefully.\n    *   Reactant C1(R) is attacked. Me- attacks from 'up' (beta), opposite to the 'down' (alpha) C1-O bond. Inversion occurs.\n    *   The product has the OH at C1 (from reactant C6). The C6-O bond was 'down', so OH is 'down' (alpha). The C6-H was 'up', so H is 'up' (beta).\n    *   Let's assign the configuration for this new C1 center. Priorities: OH > C2(gem-diMe) > C6(CH2) > H. The lowest priority group (H) is 'up' (wedge). So we trace the path 1->2->3 and reverse the result. Path OH(1,down) -> C2(2, in plane) -> C6(3, in plane) is counter-clockwise. Reversing CCW gives **(R)**.\n    *   So, the configuration at C1 is indeed (R).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pathway involving attack at the more hindered C1 site correctly predicts the stereochemistry of all centers in option A.\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n2.  **Reaction:** Attack of Me⁻ at the more hindered C1, against the general rule but dictated by the available answers.\n3.  **Mechanism:** Sₙ2 attack from the 'up' (beta) face, opposite the 'down' (alpha) C1-O bond.\n4.  **Resulting Product Structure:**\n    *   OH group at the new C1 (old C6) is 'down' (alpha).\n    *   Me groups at C4 and C5 (from old C3 and C4) remain 'up' (beta).\n5.  **Stereochemical Assignment:** This structure corresponds to **(1R, 4R, 5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring (the 7-oxa part). The `[4.1.0]` bridge notation confirms this structure. Let's label the carbons of the cyclohexane ring C1 through C6, with the epoxide linking C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   It is substituted with methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute configurations of the four stereocenters (C1, C3, C4, C6) are given as (1R), (3R), (4R), and (6S), respectively.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate).\n    *   This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe problem provides two key rules for the reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This means the reaction is sterically controlled.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added.\" This indicates an Sₙ2-type mechanism. The nucleophile performs a backside attack on one of the epoxide carbons, breaking the C-O bond.\n\n**3. Apply the Rules to the Specific Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the site of nucleophilic attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The nucleophilic methyl group can attack either C1 or C6 of the epoxide ring.\n    *   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n        *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (`1-methyl...`).\n        *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (since it's not mentioned otherwise and is a stereocenter).\n    *   A methyl group is much larger than a hydrogen atom. Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the product's carbon skeleton.**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, and the epoxide ring opens. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups were at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The original C6, now bearing a new methyl group, is adjacent to the new C1, so it will be numbered C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. We are left with options A and D.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the stereochemistry of the product.**\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the point of attack (C6) and retention of configuration at all other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n    *   The starting configurations are: (1R), (3R), (4R), (6S).\n    *   The configurations of the stereocenters that are not attacked are retained:\n        *   C1 remains (R). In the product, this is **1R**.\n        *   C4 remains (R). In the product, this is **4R**.\n        *   C3 remains (R). In the product, this is C5, and its configuration remains **R**.\n    *   Now, we must determine the configuration of the new stereocenter at C2 (the original C6). The starting configuration at C6 is (S). The Sₙ2 reaction causes an inversion of configuration.\n    *   **Detailed analysis of the inversion at C6:** A simple switch from (S) to (R) is only guaranteed if the substituent priorities do not change order. Here, the leaving group (O, priority #1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, which will have a lower priority than C1 and the other ring carbon). Thus, we must determine the final configuration based on the geometry of the attack.\n        *   The reaction is a backside attack. To determine the stereochemistry, we first need to know the orientation of the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen). The configuration at C6 is (S). The substituents in order of priority are O > C1 > C5 > H. For C6 to be (S), with the lowest priority group (H) pointing away from the viewer (dash/alpha), the path O → C1 → C5 must be counter-clockwise. This means the epoxide oxygen is pointing toward the viewer (wedge/beta).\n        *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the back side, i.e., from the alpha face (dash).\n        *   The inversion at C6 pushes the original H from the alpha face to the beta face (wedge).\n        *   So, in the product, the new stereocenter C2 (original C6) has the new methyl group on the alpha face (dash) and the original hydrogen on the beta face (wedge).\n        *   Let's assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog configuration to this new center (C2). The substituents are C1 (bearing OH and Me), C3 (CH₂), the new Me, and H. The priority order is C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n        *   The lowest priority group (H) is on the beta face (wedge). According to the CIP rules, when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, the configuration is the reverse of what the path indicates.\n        *   Tracing the path from highest to lowest priority (C1 → C3 → Me), we observe a clockwise (CW) direction on the ring.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group (H) is wedge, we reverse the result: CW becomes (S).\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 in the product is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Assemble the final product name.**\n    *   Combining the configurations of all stereocenters in the product: (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   The full IUPAC name is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThis name and configuration match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires a careful application of the rules of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity for the ring-opening of epoxides with organocuprates (Gilman reagents).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 with the specified stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate). This reagent delivers a methyl nucleophile (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\n1.  Identify the carbons of the epoxide ring: C1 and C6.\n2.  Compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, and C6).\n    *   **C6** is a **secondary** carbon (bonded to a hydrogen, C5, and C1).\n3.  A secondary carbon is less sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The methyl group attacks C6 from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack). This breaks the C6-O bond, and the epoxide ring opens. The oxygen, which remains attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻), and is subsequently protonated during the reaction workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n2.  **Product Skeleton & IUPAC Numbering:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring with four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is given the number 1.\n    *   Thus, the original C1 (with the -OH group) becomes the **new C1**.\n    *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (original C6) becomes the **new C2**.\n    *   The other carbons are renumbered accordingly: original C4 becomes new C4, and original C3 becomes new C5.\n    *   The product has methyl groups at the new C1, C2, C4, and C5 positions. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This structural information eliminates options A and B, which describe a `2,2,4,5-` isomer.\n\n3.  **Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **At New C2 (from original C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration. The starting configuration at C6 was **S**. Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 will be **R**.\n    *   **At New C1 (from original C1):** This center was not attacked, so its configuration is retained. It was **R** and remains **R**.\n    *   **At New C4 (from original C4):** This center was unaffected by the reaction. It was **R** and remains **R**.\n    *   **At New C5 (from original C3):** This center was also unaffected. It was **R** and remains **R**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagent:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n        *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring (the 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core).\n        *   The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n        *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   The stereochemistry at the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is specified as R, R, R, and S, respectively.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This provides a soft nucleophile, `Me-` (a methyl anion equivalent).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism, Regioselectivity, and Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The problem statement provides a key rule for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n        *   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n        *   C1 is a quaternary carbon because it is bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms (C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n        *   C6 is a tertiary carbon because it is bonded to three other non-hydrogen atoms (C1, C5, O) and one hydrogen.\n        *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group (`Me-`) will occur at C6.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem also states: \"in the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n        *   This describes an Sₙ2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism.\n        *   The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack).\n        *   The starting configuration at the attack site, C6, is given as `S`.\n        *   Due to the Sₙ2 mechanism, there will be an inversion of configuration at C6. Therefore, the stereochemistry at this carbon in the product must be `R`.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction involves the `Me-` nucleophile attacking C6, and the C6-O bond breaking. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after acidic or aqueous workup.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group and a methyl group on C1 (from the starting material), a new methyl group on C6, and the original methyl groups on C3 and C4. So, it's a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n    *   To name the product using IUPAC rules, the carbon atom bearing the primary functional group (-OH) gets the lowest possible number, C1. This carbon was C1 in the starting material.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (positions) to the methyl groups.\n        *   Numbering C1 → C2(old C6) → C3(old C5) → C4(old C4) → C5(old C3) → C6(old C2) places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Thus, the base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This conclusion eliminates options A and C, which have the incorrect molecular structure `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (this would result from an attack at C1).\n\n4.  **Determine the Full Stereochemical Name of the Product:**\n    *   We are left with options B and D:\n        *   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry of each center in the product:\n        *   **At C2 (the site of attack, old C6):** We established that the configuration must invert from `S` to `R`. So, the product must be `2R`. This immediately eliminates option B (which has `2S`) and points strongly to option D.\n        *   **At C4 (old C4) and C5 (old C3):** These centers are not directly involved in the reaction. Their geometric configuration is retained. Therefore, their R/S descriptors are expected to remain the same. Old C3 was `R`, so new C5 is `R`. Old C4 was `R`, so new C4 is `R`. This is consistent with both options B and D.\n        *   **At C1:** This center is not attacked, but one of its bonds (C1-O) is broken. The geometric configuration is retained. However, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents can change, which might change the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that the priorities of the substituents on C1 do change, which should invert the descriptor from `R` to `S`. Option D lists C1 as `R`.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   There is a conflict. The fundamental chemical principle of Sₙ2 inversion dictates that C6(`S`) must become C2(`R`). This selects option D.\n    *   A rigorous application of CIP priority rules suggests C1(`R`) should become C1(`S`), which contradicts option D.\n    *   In such scenarios in chemistry problems, the stereochemical outcome of the core reaction mechanism (the Sₙ2 inversion) is the most critical and defining feature. Errors in assigning CIP descriptors for remote, complex centers in provided options are more common than the question contradicting a fundamental reaction principle.\n    *   Therefore, we prioritize the fact that C2 must be `R`. This makes D the only plausible answer.\n\n    The correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n### Breakdown of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

These reagents are a source of soft nucleophiles, in this case, a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Key Principles**: The problem provides two crucial rules for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides, which are well-established in organic chemistry:\n    *   **Regioselectivity**: The incoming nucleophile (the methyl group from the cuprate) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring. This occurs because organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and the reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the SN2 reaction mechanism.\n\n3.  **Applying the Principles to the Specific Molecule**:\n    *   **Identifying the point of attack**: The epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane system.\n        *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n        *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n        *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and it will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent.\n    *   **Determining the stereochemical outcome**: The attack on C6 proceeds via an SN2 mechanism.\n        *   The initial configuration at C6 is given as (S).\n        *   An SN2 reaction causes an inversion of stereochemistry.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at the carbon atom that was C6 will become (R) in the product.\n    *   **Predicting the product's structure**:\n        *   The methyl group attacks C6, and the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   A new methyl group is now attached to the former C6.\n        *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the reaction and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n4.  **Naming the Final Product**:\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1.\n    *   **Mapping from old numbering to new**:\n        *   Old **C1** (with an R configuration, a methyl group, and the new -OH group) becomes the new **C1**. Its configuration remains (R).\n        *   Old **C6** (with an S configuration, attacked by Me⁻) becomes the new **C2**.

This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Epoxide Structure:**\n    *   The core is a `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` which is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide.\n    *   The bridgehead carbons where the epoxide is fused are C1 and C6.\n    *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n3.  **Determine Regioselectivity:** The user prompt correctly states that organocuprates, being soft nucleophiles, attack the *less* sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary center.\n    *   C6 is substituted only with hydrogens (apart from the ring carbons and oxygen), making it a tertiary center.\n    *   Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack). This attack results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The site of attack is C6, which has an initial configuration of (S).\n    *   The S_N2 attack will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n    *   The C1-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked, so its configuration is retained. The same applies to the stereocenters at C3 and C4.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol.\n    *   The hydroxyl group is on the original C1. For IUPAC naming, this carbon becomes C1 of the product.\n    *   The original C1 also has a methyl group.\n    *   A new methyl group from the Gilman reagent is added to the original C6. Following IUPAC rules to give the lowest locants, this carbon becomes C2.\n    *   The methyl groups on the original C3 and C4 are now on C5 and C4, respectively (renumbering the ring starting from the C1-OH).\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Regioselectivity:**\nThe first rule dictates that the nucleophile from the organocuprate will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   Carbon-1 (C1) of the epoxide is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   Carbon-6 (C6) of the epoxide is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\nFollowing this rule, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) will preferentially attack the less hindered C6.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe second rule states that the reaction is an S_N2-type attack, which means the nucleophile adds to the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon center that is attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the attacked carbon, C6, is (S).\n*   Due to the S_N2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become (R).\nThe configurations of the other chiral centers in the molecule (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n**4. Product Formation:**\nThe nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n**5. Product Identification:**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The final product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereochemistry at the chiral centers is determined as follows:\n    *   **C1:** Retains its (R) configuration.\n    *   **C2 (originally C6):** Inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n    *   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the full IUPAC name of the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
