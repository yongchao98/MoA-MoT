Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is in a magnetic field `B_initial = B * z_hat` (where `z_hat` is the unit vector in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = - (γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution and Expectation Value\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`.\nWe know that `μz = γ * Sz`, so we need to calculate `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)>`.\nThe expectation value of `Sz` at time `t` is given by:\n`<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\nwhere `|ψ(t)>` is the state of the system at time `t`, which evolves from the initial state `|ψ(0)>` according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)> = exp(-i * (-γB * Sy) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γB * Sy * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis problem can be solved in a few ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe equation of motion for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `dμ/dt = γ (μ x B)`. This equation describes the precession of the magnetic moment vector `μ` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n*   The magnitude of the angular frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   In our case, at `t=0`, the magnetic moment is aligned with the Z-axis (`μ(0)` is in the +Z direction).\n*   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is along the Y-axis.\n*   Therefore, the magnetic moment vector `μ` will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment, `μz`, will oscillate as the vector precesses. If the angle of precession is `θ(t) = ωt`, then `μz(t) = |μ| * cos(ωt)`.\n*   The oscillation frequency is simply the precession frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Heisenberg Picture)\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the state remains fixed as `|+z>`, while the operators evolve in time. The time evolution of the `Sz` operator is given by a rotation around the y-axis (the direction of the new field `B`) by an angle `θ = γBt`.\n\n`Sz(t) = Sz(0)cos(γBt) - Sx(0)sin(γBt)`\n\nNow, we find the expectation value of `Sz(t)` in the initial state `|+z>`:\n`<Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z> = <+z| (Sz cos(γBt) - Sx sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n`<Sz(t)> = cos(γBt) <+z| Sz |+z> - sin(γBt) <+z| Sx |+z>`\n\nWe know the following for a spin-up state:\n*   `<+z| Sz |+z> = ħ/2` (The state is an eigenstate of `Sz`).\n*   `<+z| Sx |+z> = 0` (The expectation value of `Sx` in an eigenstate of `Sz` is zero).\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n`<Sz(t)> = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) - sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ * (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe average value oscillates with a function `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the classical analogy and the full quantum mechanical calculation show that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has spin 1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate with respect to the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field:\n    `H = -μ · B = -γ(Sx*Bx + Sy*By + Sz*Bz)`\n    Since the new field is `B = Bĵ`, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n    `H = -γB * Sy`\n    where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t)`. To find this, we need to calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin oscillates as:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    `<μz>(t) = γ * <Sz>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe term `cos(γBt)` describes an oscillation. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at this frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution to the quantum mechanics problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (t < 0)**\nThe particle has a spin 1/2 and is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -mu . B = -gamma * B * Sz`. The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (energy `-gamma*B*hbar/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (energy `+gamma*B*hbar/2`). The lowest energy state is `|+z>`. So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n**2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)**\nThe magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -mu . B = -gamma * B * Sy`.\n\n**3. Time Evolution of the State**\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by `|psi(t)> = U(t)|psi(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar)` is the time evolution operator. To calculate this, it's easiest to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (i.e., the eigenbasis of `Sy`).\n*   The eigenstates of `Sy` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   We can write `|+z>` as a superposition: `|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n*   Applying the time evolution operator to this superposition, the state evolves as:\n    `|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (exp(-i*E_+y*t/hbar)|+y> + exp(-i*E_-y*t/hbar)|-y>)`\n    where `E_+y` and `E_-y` are the energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   After substituting the energy values and converting back to the Z-basis, we find:\n    `|psi(t)> = cos(gamma*B*t/2)|+z> - sin(gamma*B*t/2)|-z>`\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value**\nWe need the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<mu_z>(t) = <psi(t)| gamma*Sz |psi(t)>`.\n*   Calculating this gives: `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * (hbar/2) * (cos^2(gamma*B*t/2) - sin^2(gamma*B*t/2))`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, this simplifies to:\n    `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * (hbar/2) * cos(gamma*B*t)`\n\n**5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\nThe expectation value `<mu_z>(t)` oscillates as `cos(Omega*t)`, where `Omega` is the angular frequency. By comparing this form to our result, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `Omega = gamma * B`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this logic and prints the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spin_precession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the oscillation frequency of a spin-1/2 particle's\n    magnetic moment in a changing magnetic field.\n\n    Problem Setup:\n    1. Initial state (t<0): A spin-1/2 particle is in its lowest energy state\n       in a magnetic field B pointing in the +Z direction. This means the initial\n       state |psi(0)> is the spin-up state along Z, |+z>.\n    2. New dynamics (t>0): The Z-field is turned off, and a new field of the\n       same magnitude B is turned on in the +Y direction. The system now evolves\n       under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * Sy.\n\n    Derivation:\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z>,\n    is calculated as a function of time.\n    <mu_z>(t) = <psi(t)| (gamma * Sz) |psi(t)>\n\n    The calculation, based on the principles of quantum mechanics, yields the\n    following result for the time evolution of this expectation value:\n\n    <mu_z>(t) = A * cos(gamma * B * t)\n\n    where A is the initial amplitude of the magnetic moment.\n\n    Conclusion:\n    The expression for <mu_z>(t) is a cosine function of time.

The z-component is μ_z = γS_z.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The eigenstates of S_z are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest possible energy state. Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy is E_up.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the z-axis: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The old field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B**ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n    *   The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the system does not have time to change at the moment of the switch. So, the state at t=0+ is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    *   For all t > 0, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: H_new = -**μ** · **B'** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the State (for t > 0):**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for H_new and `|ψ(0)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) * |+z>`\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector, which was initially pointing along the +Z axis, around the new magnetic field direction (the +Y axis). The angular velocity of this precession is the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, we can express the initial state `|+z>` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (i.e., the eigenstates of S_y).\n    *   The eigenstates of S_y are `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the S_z basis:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   We can write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   The energies corresponding to the S_y eigenstates are:\n        E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)\n        E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)\n    *   Now, we evolve the state in time:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_{+y}t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_{-y}t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   To find `<S_z>(t)`, we substitute the S_y eigenstates back in terms of S_z eigenstates. After some algebra (using Euler's formula `cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2` and `sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/(2i)`), we get:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<S_z>(t)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * S_z * [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * [cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The time-dependent part of this expression is `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   An oscillation of the form `cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency of `Ω`.\n    *   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(Ωt)`, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **\"Suddenly\"**: This is the key to using the sudden approximation, which states that the wavefunction does not change at the instant the Hamiltonian changes.\n*   **Observable**: The question asks for the oscillation of the *average of the z-component of the moment* (`<μ_z>`), not the spin (`<S_z>`). However, since they are related by a constant factor (`γ`), their oscillation frequency is the same.\n*   **Frequency**: In physics, \"frequency\" in this context almost always refers to the angular frequency (in radians per second), not the ordinary frequency (in Hertz). The options confirm this. The phenomenon described is Larmor precession, and the frequency `γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n\nOscillation Frequency = γB\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the output of a symbolic calculation for the problem. Let's analyze this output to determine the final answer.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Problem Statement:** We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`. The particle starts aligned with a Z-field, which is then suddenly switched to a Y-field of the same magnitude `B`.\n\n2.  **Initial State:** The particle is initially in the spin-up state along the z-axis, `|+z>`. This is the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -γB S_z`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian `H_new = -γB S_y`. The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in `<μ_z>(t) = γ <S_z>(t) = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Code Output:** The provided code output is the result of calculating `<μ_z>(t)`:\n    `0.5*gamma*hbar*cos(1.0*B*gamma*t)`\n\n    Let's rewrite this in a more standard physics notation:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = (1/2) * γ * ħ * cos(B * γ * t)`\n    `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`\n\n6.  **Identifying the Oscillation Frequency:** The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A general oscillatory function is written as `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where:\n    *   `A` is the amplitude of oscillation.\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `φ` is the phase shift.\n\n    Comparing our result, `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`, with the general form, we can identify the components:\n    *   Amplitude `A = γħ/2`\n    *   Angular frequency `ω = γB`\n    *   Phase shift `φ = 0`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency `ω`. From our analysis of the code output, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n8.  **Matching with Options:**\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B\n    C) gamma*B/2\n    D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\n    The calculated frequency `γB` matches option B. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment, such as that of a spin-1/2 particle, is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Change of Field (t = 0):** The magnetic field is instantaneously switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n\n3.  **Precession (t > 0):** The magnetic moment, which was initially pointing along the Z-axis, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This precession occurs in the X-Z plane.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:** As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection will oscillate between its initial maximum value, through zero, to a minimum value, and back.\n\nThe angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω`, which is given by the formula:\n\n`ω = γB`\n\nwhere:\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThis frequency `ω` is precisely the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. The search results confirm that for a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is `γB`. This is a standard result in quantum mechanics and magnetic resonance. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>`, can be calculated to be proportional to `cos(γBt)`, which explicitly shows an oscillation with angular frequency `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, `Sz`. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is given by `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S` by the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` (i.e., `μ = γS`), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`.\n\nIn this problem, the new magnetic field is `B = Bŷ`, so the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`, where `Sy` is the Y-component of the spin operator.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of any spin component will be an oscillation. This is the quantum mechanical analogue of Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate as `cos(γBt)`. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe physical process described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle has a spin magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin angular momentum operator. The magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (in the +Z direction). The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field, meaning it is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis. This is the lowest energy eigenstate for the initial Hamiltonian H = -γB S_z.\n\n2.  **Change in Hamiltonian (t = 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B** = B**ŷ** (in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the system is H' = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):** The initial spin state (spin-up along Z) is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The spin vector will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This precession occurs in the X-Z plane.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of ⟨μ_z⟩:** As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, will vary sinusoidally.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The rate of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, ω. The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field B and the gyromagnetic ratio γ. The formula for the angular frequency of precession is ω = γB.\n\nA detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this result. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is found to be ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). Consequently, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt). The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of *t* inside the cosine function, which is γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ⃗ = γS⃗`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S⃗` is the spin operator.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B⃗ = B ẑ`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ⃗ ⋅ B⃗ = -γ(S⃗ ⋅ B ẑ) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is `E_up`.

Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle is in a magnetic field `B_z = B * z_hat`. Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ . B_z = -γ * S_z * B`. Since the moment is aligned, the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state vector is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n*   **Final State (t > 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_y = B * y_hat`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ . B_y = -γ * S_y * B`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. The time-evolved state `|ψ(t)>` is given by:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / hbar) |ψ(t=0)>`\nSubstituting the expressions for `H_new` and `|ψ(t=0)>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / hbar) |+z>`\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / hbar) |+z>`\n\nThis expression describes a rotation of the initial state `|+z>` around the Y-axis by an angle `θ(t) = γ * B * t`. This physical phenomenon is known as **Larmor precession**. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, will precess around the new magnetic field axis (+Y).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <γ * S_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`.\nThe expectation value of `S_z` at time `t` is:\n`<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this in a few ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Direct Calculation)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian.**\n    The new Hamiltonian is proportional to `S_y`. The Pauli matrix for `S_y` is `S_y = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    The initial state `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y` (`|+y>` and `|-y>`).\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * |+y> - (i/√2) * |-y>`\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    The eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>` have energies `E_+ = -γB(hbar/2)` and `E_- = +γB(hbar/2)` under `H_new`.\n    The time evolution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/hbar) * |+y> - (i/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/hbar) * |-y>`\n    Let `ω = γB`. Then `E_+ = -ω*hbar/2` and `E_- = +ω*hbar/2`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2) * |+y> - (i/√2) * exp(-iωt/2) * |-y>`\n\n3.  **Convert back to the Z-basis and calculate `<S_z>`**.\n    After substituting the Z-basis representations of `|+y>` and `|-y>` and simplifying (using Euler's formulas), we find the state vector at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n\n4.  Now, calculate the expectation value:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z>(t) = (hbar/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (hbar/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (hbar/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The oscillation is described by the `cos(ωt)` term. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    Since we defined `ω = γB`, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture\n\nThe Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator `A` is `dA/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [A, H]`.\nFor `A = S_z` and `H = -γBS_y`:\n`dS_z/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [S_z, -γBS_y] = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * [S_z, S_y]`\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_z, S_y] = -i*hbar*S_x`:\n`dS_z/dt = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * (-i*hbar*S_x) = +γB*S_x`\n\nSimilarly, for `A = S_x`:\n`dS_x/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [S_x, -γBS_y] = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * [S_x, S_y]`\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = i*hbar*S_z`:\n`dS_x/dt = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * (i*hbar*S_z) = -γB*S_z`\n\nWe have a system of coupled differential equations:\n1.  `dS_z/dt = γB * S_x`\n2.  `dS_x/dt = -γB * S_z`\n\nDifferentiating the first equation and substituting the second gives:\n`d²S_z/dt² = γB * (dS_x/dt) = γB * (-γB * S_z) = -(γB)² * S_z`\n`d²S_z/dt² + (γB)² * S_z = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Energy Splitting\n\nThe initial state `|+z>` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates (`|+y>` and `|-y>`) of the new Hamiltonian. The energies are `E_+ = -γB(hbar/2)` and `E_- = +γB(hbar/2)`.\nThe interference between these two energy components in the superposition causes observables (that are not diagonal in the energy basis) to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is given by the energy difference:\n`ω = ΔE / hbar = (E_- - E_+) / hbar`\n`ω = ( (γB*hbar/2) - (-γB*hbar/2) ) / hbar`\n`ω = (γB*hbar) / hbar = γB`\n\nAll three methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics that describes the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ_vec = γS_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field `B_vec` is in the +Z direction: `B_vec = B k̂`.\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ_vec ⋅ B_vec = -γ(S_vec ⋅ B k̂) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z⟩` (with energy `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with energy `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`).\n*   The lowest energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, so the new field is `B'_vec = B ĵ`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H'` that governs the time evolution for `t ≥ 0` is `H' = -μ_vec ⋅ B'_vec = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian `H'`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix. The evolution operator becomes:\n    `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n*   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix, we can expand the operator with `θ = γBt/2`:\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y)|+z⟩`\n*   Since `I|+z⟩ = |+z⟩` and `σ_y|+z⟩ = i|-z⟩`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + isin(γBt/2)(i|-z⟩) = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we need to calculate `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|γS_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Let's evaluate the expectation value:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ (⟨cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|⟩) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩)`\n*   We use the properties `S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩`, and the orthogonality of the states (`⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1`, `⟨-z|-z⟩ = 1`, `⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0`). The cross-terms vanish, leaving:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ [cos²(γBt/2)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ + sin²(γBt/2)⟨-z|S_z|-z⟩]`\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ [cos²(γBt/2)(ħ/2) + sin²(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)]`\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expression for the expectation value `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time. The general form for an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   The coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Hamiltonian\n\n*   **Initial Situation (t < 0):** A spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`, where `μ = γS` is the magnetic moment and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the spin-up `|+z⟩` and spin-down `|-z⟩` states. The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_down = +γ(ħ/2)B`. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   **New Situation (t ≥ 0):** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_y B`.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Solving the Time Evolution\n\nTo find `|ψ(t)⟩`, it is most convenient to express the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to the spin operator `S_y`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we denote as `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates of S_y:**\n    *   `|+y⟩` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n    *   `|-y⟩` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`.\n*   **Energy Eigenstates of H:**\n    *   For `|+y⟩`, the energy is `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   For `|-y⟩`, the energy is `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n\nNext, we express the initial state `|+z⟩` in terms of `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. The standard relations are:\n`|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n`|-z⟩ = (-i/√2) (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)`\n\nSo, the initial state is:\n`|ψ(0)⟩ = (1/√2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) |-y⟩`\n\nNow, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are energy eigenstates, the evolution is simple:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-iE_+t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-iE_-t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`. We need to calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nTo do this, we need to know how `S_z` acts on the `y`-basis states:\n`S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |-y⟩`\n`S_z |-y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩`\n\nNow we can compute the expectation value:\n`S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n`= (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) S_z|+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) S_z|-y⟩ ]`\n`= (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) (ħ/2)|-y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) (ħ/2)|+y⟩ ]`\n`= (ħ/(2√2)) [ e^(-iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nNow, we take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)|`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\n`⟨ψ(t)| = (1/√2) [ e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ]`\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ] ⋅ (ħ/(2√2)) [ e^(-iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis (`⟨+y|+y⟩ = 1`, `⟨-y|-y⟩ = 1`, `⟨+y|-y⟩ = 0`), we get:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(-iγBt/2)e^(-iγBt/2) + e^(iγBt/2)e^(iγBt/2) ]`\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(-iγBt) + e^(iγBt) ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formula, `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`, we find:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ 2 cos(γBt) ] = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThis is a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. By comparing this to our result, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency, which describes the precession of the spin expectation vector around the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment `μ` (which is proportional to its spin `S`, `μ = γS`) is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Change of Field**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The magnetic moment, which was pointing in the Z direction, now finds itself in a magnetic field pointing along the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Precession**: The magnetic field `B` exerts a torque on the magnetic moment `μ`, causing the magnetic moment vector to rotate, or precess, around the new field direction (+Y axis).\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-component**: As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. Since the initial moment was entirely along the Z-axis, it starts at its maximum value and then decreases, passes through zero, reaches a minimum (pointing in the -Z direction), and then returns to its initial state. This periodic change is an oscillation.\n\n5.  **Frequency Calculation**: The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω`, and is given by the formula:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle, a constant that relates its magnetic moment to its angular momentum.\n    *   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`, will oscillate according to the equation:\n`<μz(t)> = <μz(0)> * cos(ωt) = <μz(0)> * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` in the cosine function, which is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis physical situation describes the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new field direction.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`, will oscillate as the spin precesses. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):** The particle is aligned with the Z-axis, so its state is the \"spin up\" eigenstate of the Sz operator, denoted as `|+z>`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):** The magnetic field is now `B` in the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian `H` which governs the evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B = -γ(S · B) = -γB*Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Calculation:** By carrying out the quantum mechanical calculation, it can be shown that `<Sz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`.\n6.  **Frequency:** The term `cos(γBt)` describes an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin. Therefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates at the Larmor frequency.\n\nGiven the options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, Sz.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment is no longer aligned with the field. The magnetic field exerts a torque on the magnetic moment, causing it to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic moment (μ), the spin angular momentum (S), and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is given by μ = γS. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field B is H = -μ ⋅ B.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` is given by the torque equation `d<S>/dt = γ(<S> × B)`. This equation shows that the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial state has the spin aligned along the Z-axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` is applied along the Y-axis.\n*   The spin vector, and thus the magnetic moment, will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment will oscillate as its projection onto the Z-axis changes over time.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nThe particle is spin 1/2 and is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\nGiven $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\nThe z-component of spin is $S_z$. For a spin 1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ and $-\\hbar/2$, corresponding to the eigenstates $|+z\\rangle$ (spin up) and $|-z\\rangle$ (spin down).\n\nThe initial Hamiltonian is $H_i = -\\gamma S_z B$. The energy eigenvalues are $E = -\\gamma B m_s \\hbar$, where $m_s = \\pm 1/2$.\n*   For spin up ($|+z\\rangle$), $E_{\\uparrow} = -\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n*   For spin down ($|-z\\rangle$), $E_{\\downarrow} = +\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n\nAssuming $\\gamma B > 0$, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time $t=0$ is:\n$|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+z\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\nAt $t=0$, the magnetic field is switched to $\\vec{B}' = B\\hat{j}$ (pointing in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian for $t>0$ is:\n$H_f = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}' = -\\gamma (\\vec{S} \\cdot B\\hat{j}) = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian:\n$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iH_f t / \\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t / \\hbar} |+z\\rangle = e^{i \\gamma B t S_y / \\hbar} |+z\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nWe need to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n$\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$.\n\nWe can solve this using two common methods.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Ehrenfest's Theorem)\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin operator is given by:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[\\vec{S}, H_f]\\rangle$\n\nSubstituting $H_f = -\\gamma B S_y$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_z, -\\gamma B S_y]\\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_z, S_y]\\rangle$\n\nUsing the spin commutation relation $[S_z, S_y] = -i\\hbar S_x$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}(-i\\hbar \\langle S_x \\rangle) = \\gamma B \\langle S_x \\rangle$  (Eq. 1)\n\nSimilarly, for $\\langle S_x \\rangle$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_x, -\\gamma B S_y]\\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_x, S_y]\\rangle$\n\nUsing the commutation relation $[S_x, S_y] = i\\hbar S_z$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}(i\\hbar \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle$ (Eq. 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations. We can solve them by differentiating Eq. 1 with respect to time:\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle$\n\nSubstitute Eq. 2 into this:\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B (-\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -(\\gamma B)^2 \\langle S_z \\rangle$\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n$\\omega = \\gamma B$\n\n#### Method 2: Energy Eigenstate Decomposition\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the expectation value of an observable in a two-level system is given by the energy difference between the levels, $\\omega = \\Delta E / \\hbar$.\n\n1.  Find the eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian $H_f = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$.\n2.  The energy eigenvalues are therefore:\n    *   $E_1 = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n    *   $E_2 = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n3.  The energy difference between these two states is:\n    $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}\\right) = \\gamma B \\hbar$.\n4.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition:\n    $\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B$.\n\nThis method works because the initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is a superposition of the energy eigenstates of $H_f$ (which are the eigenstates of $S_y$), and the observable $S_z$ has non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements in the $S_y$ basis. Both conditions are met.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The average z-component of the particle's moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$, oscillates with an angular frequency of $\\omega = \\gamma B$. This is the well-known Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe problem describes a classic quantum mechanical phenomenon known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle has a spin of 1/2, and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up state with respect to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian and Time Evolution**: The interaction between a magnetic moment `μ` and a magnetic field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Given that the magnetic moment is `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator), the new Hamiltonian, after the field is switched to the +Y direction, becomes `H = -γB * Sy`. The state of the particle will then evolve over time according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession**: When the magnetic field is suddenly changed, the spin of the particle does not instantly realign. Instead, the expectation value of the spin vector begins to precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). The z-component of the magnetic moment is proportional to the z-component of the spin, `μz = γSz`. We are interested in the average, or expectation value, of this component, which is `<μz(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Oscillation**: The calculation of the expectation value `<μz(t)>` shows that it oscillates. The expectation value of the spin's z-component, `<Sz(t)>`, will vary as `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n\n5.  **The Oscillation Frequency**: This angular frequency of precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ωL`. The formula for the Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio and the magnitude of the magnetic field. The frequency `ω` is given by the equation:\n\n    `ω = γB`\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem using quantum mechanics principles, which will be implemented in the Python code:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:** The particle is initially in a magnetic field along the +Z direction and its spin is aligned with it. This means the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `|+z⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|-z⟩ = [0, 1]`, the initial state vector `ψ(0)` is `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:** When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the system's evolution is given by `H = -μ · B = -γ(S · B)`. Since the new field is `B` in the +Y direction, `H = -γB * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system at a later time `t`, `ψ(t)`, is found by applying the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` to the initial state `ψ(0)`.\n    *   `ψ(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) ψ(0)`\n    *   Substituting `H = -γB * Sy`, this becomes `ψ(t) = exp(iγB*t*Sy/ħ) ψ(0)`.\n    *   The spin operator `Sy` can be expressed using the Pauli matrix `σ_y` as `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    *   This simplifies the operator to `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩`. This is equal to `γ⟨Sz⟩`. The expectation value of `Sz` at time `t` is calculated as `⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:** The resulting expression for `⟨μz⟩(t)` will be a function that oscillates with time, typically in the form of `cos(ωt)` or `sin(ωt)`. The angular frequency `ω` is the oscillation frequency we are looking for.\n\nThe Python code below will use the `sympy` library to perform these matrix and symbolic calculations to find the expression for `⟨μz⟩(t)` and identify its oscillation frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import I, Matrix, cos, sin, Symbol, exp, pi\n\ndef solve_spin_oscillation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's\n    magnetic moment in a magnetic field.\n\n    The problem involves a spin initially aligned in the +Z direction, which is then\n    subjected to a magnetic field in the +Y direction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

Define the Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`. The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ_vec . B_vec = -γ(S_vec) . (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`.\n    *   `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n**2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)**\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B'_vec = B * y_hat` is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ_vec . B'_vec = -γ(S_vec) . (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Time Evolution of the State**\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`. We want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, where `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. A very effective method for this is to use the Heisenberg picture or Ehrenfest's theorem.\n\n**Method: Using the Equations of Motion for Expectation Values (Ehrenfest's Theorem)**\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by:\n`d/dt ⟨A⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩`\n\nLet's apply this to `⟨S_z⟩` and `⟨S_x⟩`:\n*   **For `⟨S_z⟩`:**\n    `d/dt ⟨S_z⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, -γB * S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_z, S_y]⟩`\n    Using the spin commutator relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    `d/dt ⟨S_z⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨-iħS_x⟩ = γB⟨S_x⟩`  --- (Equation 1)\n\n*   **For `⟨S_x⟩`:**\n    `d/dt ⟨S_x⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, -γB * S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_x, S_y]⟩`\n    Using the spin commutator relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`.\n    `d/dt ⟨S_x⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨iħS_z⟩ = -γB⟨S_z⟩` --- (Equation 2)\n\n**4.

The average, or expectation value, of the spin components perpendicular to an applied magnetic field will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian (the energy operator) of the system is given by `H = -μ · B = -γ * B * S_y`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `B` is the magnetic field, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, can be shown to evolve according to the equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² * <S_z>`\n\n4.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for `<S_z>(t)` is a sinusoidal oscillation. The angular frequency `ω` of this oscillation is the term inside the square, which is `ω = γB`. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`, is directly proportional to `<S_z>` (since `μ_z = γS_z`), so it oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nThis precession of the spin's expectation value around the magnetic field is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin expectation value points along +Z. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment, and thus the spin, begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y).\n\nAs the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nHere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThis result can be derived formally using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but it is a standard result in quantum mechanics and magnetic resonance. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate as cos(γBt), meaning the frequency of oscillation is indeed γB. This frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, S_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the spin begins to precess around the new axis of the magnetic field.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the system in the presence of a magnetic field **B** is given by H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **μ** is the magnetic moment. Since **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ**S** ⋅ **B**.\n\nWith the new magnetic field **B** = B**ŷ**, the Hamiltonian is H = -γB S_y. The time evolution of the expectation value of any operator that does not explicitly depend on time is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion. For the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z⟩, its expectation value will oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by ω = γB (in angular frequency units). The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z(t)⟩, and consequently the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, will oscillate with this frequency.\n\nThe detailed calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin is ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). The argument of the cosine function is ωt, which means the angular frequency of oscillation is ω = γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2. Its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the vector equation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem statement `μ = γSz` is a common shorthand for the z-component `μz = γSz`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. This means the spin is also aligned with the +Z direction, which minimizes the interaction energy `E = -μ · B`.\n    *   The state of a spin-1/2 particle aligned with the +Z axis is the \"spin-up\" eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, which we denote as `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is given by the interaction energy with the new field:\n        `H = -μ · B = -γS · (B ĵ) = -γB Sy`\n        where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-direction and `ĵ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession Method):**\n    *   A classical magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ × B`, which causes it to precess around the magnetic field direction.\n    *   The quantum mechanical analogue, described by the Ehrenfest theorem, is that the *expectation value* of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field `B`.\n    *   The equation of motion is `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> × B)`.\n    *   This equation describes precession around the vector `B` with an angular frequency `Ω`, known as the Larmor frequency, given by:\n        `Ω = γB`\n    *   In our problem, the initial spin expectation value is `<S(0)>`, which points in the +Z direction (since the state is `|+z>`, `<Sx(0)>=0`, `<Sy(0)>=0`, `<Sz(0)> = +ħ/2`).\n    *   The new magnetic field `B` points in the +Y direction.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `<S(t)>` will precess around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane, starting from the Z-axis.\n    *   The z-component of a vector precessing in the XZ-plane with angular frequency `Ω` is described by a cosine function:\n        `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(Ωt) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is an oscillation described by `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Quantum State Evolution Method):**\n    *   We need to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. A standard way is to express the initial state in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB Sy`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a superposition of these new eigenstates:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   The time evolution of the state `|ψ(t)>` is given by applying the time evolution operator `exp(-iHt/ħ)`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iE_+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_- t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n        where `E_+` and `E_-` are the energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of Sy)`, so `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Substituting these into the state evolution equation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(i γB t / 2) |+y> + exp(-i γB t / 2) |-y> ]`\n    *   To find the expectation value of `Sz`, we can transform this state back to the z-basis. Doing so (the detailed algebra is shown in the thought process) yields:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<Sz>(t)`:\n        `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n        `<Sz>(t) = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        Using `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [ cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2) ]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   Again, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the semi-classical Larmor precession argument and the full quantum mechanical calculation show that the average of the z-component of the moment, `<μz>(t)>`, oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\n    The calculated frequency is `γB`, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin can be either \"up\" or \"down\" along a given axis. \"Aligned\" means the spin is in the higher energy state that corresponds to the magnetic moment pointing along the field. However, the potential energy is `U = -μ ⋅ B`. To be aligned, `μ` and `B` should be parallel, which minimizes the energy. If `γ > 0`, `μ_z` and `S_z` have the same sign. So `μ` is parallel to `B` when `S_z` is positive. Therefore, the particle is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    In quantum mechanics, this state is represented by the eigenvector of the `S_z` operator with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. Let's denote this state as `|+z>`. So, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new magnetic field is `B_vec = B j_hat` (where `j_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    The interaction of a magnetic moment `μ` with a magnetic field `B_vec` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec`.\n    The magnetic moment operator `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    So, `μ = γ(S_x i_hat + S_y j_hat + S_z k_hat)`.\n    The Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is:\n    `H = - (γS) ⋅ (B j_hat) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)`.\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The expression simplifies to:\n    `U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`.\n    We need to calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    Let's find the state `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n    To evaluate this, we can express the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y`. The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    In the z-basis:\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    From these, we can write the initial state `|+z>` as:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n    Now, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y`, the action of `U(t)` is simple:\n    `U(t)|+y> = exp(iωt(+ħ/2)/ħ) |+y> = exp(iωt/2) |+y>`\n    `U(t)|-y> = exp(iωt(-ħ/2)/ħ) |-y> = exp(-iωt/2) |-y>`\n\n    So, the state at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) * (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ U(t)|+y> + U(t)|-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iωt/2)|+y> + exp(-iωt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n    Now, we convert back to the z-basis to calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (exp(iωt/2) + exp(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iωt/2) - exp(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we can calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Using `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, and the orthogonality of the states:\n    `<S_z(t)> = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n    The expression for `<μ_z(t)>` is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(Ωt)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n    In our case, the argument of the cosine is `ωt`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (at t=0):**\n    *   The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment (**μ** = γ**S**) is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction (**B₀** = B **k̂**). This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate where its spin points along the +Z axis.\n    *   In the standard |↑>, |↓> basis (also known as the S_z basis), this state is the \"spin-up\" state.\n    *   So, the initial state vector at t=0 is |ψ(0)> = |+z>.\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian for Time Evolution (for t > 0):**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction: **B** = B **ĵ**.\n    *   The interaction energy between the magnetic moment and this new field is given by the Hamiltonian, H:\n        H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**\n    *   Substituting the expressions for **μ** and **B**:\n        H = -(γ**S**) ⋅ (B**ĵ**) = -γB S_y\n    *   This Hamiltonian is constant for t > 0 and will govern the evolution of the system.\n\n3.  **Analyze the System's Dynamics (Heisenberg Picture):**\n    *   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ_z(t)>. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is proportional to the expectation value of the S_z operator, <S_z(t)>. We need to find how <S_z(t)> oscillates.\n    *   The Heisenberg picture provides a direct way to see how the operators evolve in time. The Heisenberg equation of motion for any operator A is:\n        d**A**/dt = (i/ħ) [H, **A**]\n    *   Let's apply this to the S_z operator:\n        d(S_z)/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_z] = (i/ħ) [-γB S_y, S_z]\n        d(S_z)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) [S_y, S_z]\n    *   Using the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators, [S_y, S_z] = iħS_x, we get:\n        d(S_z)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) (iħS_x) = γB S_x  (Eq. 1)\n    *   This equation shows that the rate of change of S_z is coupled to S_x. To solve this, we must also find the time evolution of S_x:\n        d(S_x)/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_x] = (-iγB/ħ) [S_y, S_x]\n    *   Using the commutation relation [S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z:\n        d(S_x)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) (-iħS_z) = -γB S_z  (Eq. 2)\n\n4.  **Derive the Equation of Oscillation:**\n    *   We now have a system of two coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the operators, <S_z(t)> and <S_x(t)>:\n        1.  d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>\n        2.  d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>\n    *   To find an equation solely for <S_z>, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)\n    *   Now, substitute the second equation into this result:\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>)\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The derived equation, d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>, is the standard mathematical equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: d²x/dt² = -ω²x.\n    *   By direct comparison, the angular frequency (ω) of the oscillation of <S_z> is:\n        ω = γB\n    *   Since <μ_z(t)> is directly proportional to <S_z(t)>, it oscillates with the same frequency. This frequency, γB, is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\nInitially, the magnetic field is $\\vec{B}_0 = B\\hat{z}$. The Hamiltonian is $H_0 = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_0 = -\\gamma S_z B$. The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy state. The energies for spin-up ($|+\\rangle_z$, eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$) and spin-down ($|-\\rangle_z$, eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$) are $E_+ = -\\gamma B \\hbar/2$ and $E_- = +\\gamma B \\hbar/2$. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state.\nThus, the initial state of the particle at $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle_z$.\n\n**2. New Hamiltonian:**\nAt $t=0$, the field is switched to $\\vec{B'} = B\\hat{y}$. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for $t>0$ is $H' = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B'} = -\\gamma S_y B$.\n\n**3. Time Evolution and Oscillation Frequency:**\nThe state of the particle will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian $H'$. The initial state $|+\\rangle_z$ is not an eigenstate of $H'$ (since $S_z$ and $S_y$ do not commute). Therefore, the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of $H'$.\n\nThe eigenstates of $H' = -\\gamma B S_y$ are the eigenstates of the $S_y$ operator, which we denote as $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$. Their corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n*   $E'_+ = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}$ (for state $|+\\rangle_y$)\n*   $E'_- = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}$ (for state $|-\\rangle_y$)\n\nWhen a quantum system is in a superposition of two energy eigenstates with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, the expectation value of any observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate with an angular frequency given by the Bohr frequency rule:\n$\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar}$\n\nIn this case, the energy difference is $\\Delta E = E'_- - E'_+ = (\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}) - (-\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}) = \\gamma\\hbar B$.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is therefore:\n$\\omega = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B$\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation value of the spin vector, $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$, precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis) at this frequency. Consequently, its projection onto the z-axis, $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, will oscillate sinusoidally with this angular frequency. The same applies to the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n**Detailed Calculation (as performed in the reasoning steps):**\nA full calculation of the expectation value $\\langle\\mu_z(t)\\rangle$ confirms this result:\n$\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$\nFrom this expression, it is clear that the angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is $\\gamma B$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in the \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change**: The Z-direction field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude, B, is turned on along the +Y direction. The spin of the particle does not change instantaneously.\n\n3.  **Precession**: The magnetic moment (and thus the spin) begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This precession occurs at the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Larmor Frequency**: The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ · B`. For a spin, where `μ = γS` (`γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`. The equation of motion for the spin shows that it precesses around the magnetic field with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of the Z-component**: As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change. If the spin vector starts along the Z-axis, it will rotate in the X-Z plane (as it precesses around Y). The value of the z-component will trace out a cosine function over time. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the precession frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a spin-up eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The new Hamiltonian is given by H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB*S*y, where **μ** is the magnetic moment operator, **B** is the magnetic field, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and *S*y is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\nThe spin vector, which is initially pointing along the Z-axis, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The expectation value of the spin's components will evolve in time according to the Ehrenfest theorem or by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector <**S**> is d<**S**>/dt = γ(<**S**> × **B**). Since **B** is in the Y direction, this leads to the following set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components:\n\n*   d<*S*x>/dt = γB<*S*z>\n*   d<*S*y>/dt = 0\n*   d<*S*z>/dt = -γB<*S*x>\n\nDifferentiating the equation for <*S*z> with respect to time gives:\nd²<*S*z>/dt² = -γB(d<*S*x>/dt) = -γB(γB<*S*z>) = -(γB)²<*S*z>\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency ω = γB. Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and consequently the z-component of the magnetic moment, oscillates with an angular frequency of γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe initial condition is that the spin is aligned along +Z, so at t=0, <*S*z> has its maximum value of ħ/2, and <*S*x> is zero. The solution for the z-component is <*S*z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine function.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment (in this case, arising from the particle's spin) is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in the \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis. When this field is switched off and a new field of the same magnitude, B, is applied in the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y).\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and thus the z-component of the magnetic moment, will oscillate as the spin vector precesses. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nHere, ω is the angular frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this. The initial state is the eigenstate of the spin operator S_z. The time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian, H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y. By solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is found to be:\n\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)\n\nFrom this expression, the angular frequency of oscillation is clearly ω = γB. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis is a classic problem of magnetic resonance and Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle has a spin magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the z-component of spin is $S_z$.\n    *   The magnetic field is $\\vec{B}_{init} = B \\hat{k}$ (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma S_z B$.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means its magnetic moment is parallel to the field, which corresponds to the lowest energy state (ground state). For the energy $E = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$ to be minimal, $\\vec{\\mu}$ must be parallel to $\\vec{B}$. Since $\\vec{\\mu}$ is proportional to $\\vec{S}$, the spin must also be pointing in the +Z direction.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at $t=0$ is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, which we denote as $|+\\rangle_z$ or $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. In vector notation, this is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   For this state, the expectation value of the z-component of spin is $\\langle S_z \\rangle = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B \\hat{j}$ (in the +Y direction). The magnitude $B$ remains the same.\n    *   For all $t \\ge 0$, the new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is $H_{new} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma S_y B$.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):**\n    The time evolution of the state vector $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i H_{new} t / \\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$\n    Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i (-\\gamma B S_y) t / \\hbar} |+\\rangle_z = e^{i (\\gamma B t) S_y / \\hbar} |+\\rangle_z$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n    We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| \\mu_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n\n    This can be solved in a few ways.\n\n    **Method 1: The Precession Analogy (Intuitive approach)**\n    The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n    $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma (\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B})$\n    This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the direction of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.\n    *   Initially, at $t=0$, the spin is aligned with the old Z-axis: $\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle = (\\hbar/2)\\hat{k}$.\n    *   For $t>0$, the field is along the Y-axis: $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{j}$.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane with an angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n    *   The z-component of this precessing vector, $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$, will oscillate. The vector starts at its maximum z-value, so its time dependence will be a cosine function.\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle S_z(0) \\rangle \\cos(\\omega t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The average magnetic moment is then $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   From this expression, we can see that the oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n    **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    We need to evaluate $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{i (\\gamma B t) S_y / \\hbar} |+\\rangle_z$.\n    We use the matrix representation in the z-basis:\n    $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $|+\\rangle_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{i (\\gamma B t) (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y) / \\hbar} = e^{i (\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}) \\sigma_y}$.\n    Let $\\alpha = \\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}$. The operator becomes $e^{i\\alpha\\sigma_y}$.

Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction (S_z). When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new axis. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. The particle is aligned with a magnetic field **B** = B**ẑ**, meaning its spin is in the spin-up state along the z-axis. In the S_z basis, this state |ψ(0)> is represented as:\n    |ψ(0)> = |+z> = (1, 0)\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B** = B**ŷ**. The new Hamiltonian governing the system is:\n    H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ(**S** ⋅ **B**) = -γB S_y\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a later time t, |ψ(t)>, is given by:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ_z>(t), which is γ<S_z>(t).\n    <S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>\n    Substituting the expression for |ψ(t)>:\n    <S_z>(t) = <ψ(0)| e^(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The calculation shows that the expectation value of the spin's z-component oscillates over time:\n    <S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    <μ_z>(t) = γ <S_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The equation for <μ_z>(t) is a cosine function.

We can solve this by calculating the time evolution of the quantum state and then finding the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Set up the quantum system:** Define the initial state of the spin-1/2 particle. Since it's aligned with a field in the +Z direction, its initial state `|ψ(0)>` is spin-up along Z, denoted as `|+z>`.\n2.  **Define the dynamics:** When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ · B = -γB*S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. We will use Python with the SymPy library to carry out this matrix exponentiation.\n4.  **Find the expectation value:** We will calculate the average (or expectation) value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Identify the frequency:** The resulting expectation value will be an oscillating function of time, proportional to `cos(Ωt)`. The angular frequency `Ω` is the value we are looking for. We will extract this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_spin_oscillation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's \n    magnetic moment using quantum mechanics and symbolic computation with SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the physical quantities and operators using SymPy.\n    # We can set hbar=1, as it will cancel out in the final frequency calculation,\n    # but we will keep it for rigor.\n    gamma, B, t, hbar = sp.symbols('gamma B t hbar', real=True, positive=True)\n    i = sp.I\n\n    # The spin operators in the S_z basis (where |+z> is [1,0]^T).\n    S_y = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[0, -i], [i, 0]])\n    S_z = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # Step 2: Define the initial state of the system, |+z>.\n    psi_initial = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n    # Step 3: Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0, with the magnetic field along +Y.\n    H_y = -gamma * B * S_y\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the time evolution of the state vector using the evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar).\n    # We use the identity exp(i*a*PauliMatrix) = cos(a)*I + i*sin(a)*PauliMatrix\n    # The argument to the exponential is (-i*H_y*t/hbar) = (i*gamma*B*t/hbar)*S_y\n    # This simplifies to i*(gamma*B*t/2)*sigma_y.

Its state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n2.  **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin angular momentum `S`, with the relation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μz = γSz`.\n3.  **Initial Condition:** The particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. In quantum mechanics, \"aligned\" usually implies the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n4.  **Energy:** The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `E = -μ · B`. Initially, this is `E = -μz * B = -γ * Sz * B`.\n5.  **Lowest Energy State:** To minimize energy `E`, the value of `Sz` must be maximized. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the `Sz` operator are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The maximum value is `+ħ/2`.\n6.  **Initial State Vector:** Therefore, at `t=0`, the particle is in the \"spin up\" eigenstate of `Sz`. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard Z-basis, this state is represented by the vector `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Dynamics for t > 0\n\n1.  **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched from the Z-direction to the Y-direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the evolution of the system for `t > 0` is based on the new field.\n    `H = -μ · B = -μy * B`\n    Since `μy = γSy`, the new Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`.\n3.  **Sy Operator:** The spin operator `Sy` for a spin-1/2 particle in the Z-basis is:\n    `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n4.  **Hamiltonian Matrix:** Substituting `Sy` into the Hamiltonian expression:\n    `H = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n### Step 3: Evolve the State in Time\n\n1.  **Schrödinger Equation:** The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian (which we have for `t>0`), the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n2.  **Time Evolution Operator:** Let's calculate the operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)`.\n    `-iHt/ħ = -i * (-γB(ħ/2)σy) * t / ħ = i * (γBt/2) * σy`\n    So, `U(t) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy)`.\n3.  **Pauli Matrix Property:** We can use the useful identity `exp(iθn·σ) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)n·σ`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `n·σ` is a Pauli matrix.\n    Here, `θ = γBt/2` and `n·σ = σy`.\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * I + i * sin(γBt/2) * σy`\n    In matrix form:\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n4.  **Calculate |ψ(t)>:** Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    This can be written as `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Expectation Value and Find the Frequency\n\n1.  **Observable:** We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`. Since `μz = γSz`, this is `γ<Sz(t)>`. We first find `<Sz(t)>`.\n2.  **Expectation Value Calculation:** `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    *   The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   `<Sz(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n3.  **Trigonometric Identity:** Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n4.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<Sz(t)>`, oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`. The expectation value of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, therefore oscillates with the same frequency. This phenomenon is known as Larmor Precession, and `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This phrasing is key to establishing the initial state as the lowest energy eigenstate, `|+z>`.\n*   **Hamiltonian Sign**: The energy is `E = -μ·B`, so the Hamiltonian has a negative sign, `H = -γB Sy`. A mistake here would alter the time evolution.\n*   **Sudden Approximation**: The change in the magnetic field is \"sudden,\" which means the state of the system does not change during the switch. `|ψ(t=0+)> = |ψ(t=0-)>`.\n*   **Angular Frequency**: The question asks for \"frequency.\" The options provided (`γB`, etc.) have units of radians/second, which is angular frequency (`ω`), not ordinary frequency (`f = ω/2π`).\n*   **Heisenberg Picture (Alternative):** One could also solve this using the Heisenberg picture, where operators evolve in time. The equations of motion `d<S>/dt = <[S,H]>/iħ` lead to a set of coupled differential equations for `<Sx>`, `<Sy>`, and `<Sz>`, which shows that `<Sz>` oscillates with frequency `γB`. This provides a good consistency check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the expectation value `<μz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a two-component spinor. The basis states are typically chosen as the eigenstates of the `S_z` operator, the spin projection along the z-axis.\n*   `|+z>` (spin-up): `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>`\n*   `|-z>` (spin-down): `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>`\n\nThe problem states that initially, the particle's magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. The energy is minimized when `S_z` is maximized, meaning the particle is in the spin-up state.\nTherefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is:\n`|ψ(0)> = |+z>`\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian for t > 0\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is:\n`H = -μ · B_new = -γ (S · (B j_hat)) = -γB S_y`\nwhere `S_y` is the operator for the y-component of the spin.\n\n### 3. Determine the Time Evolution of the State\nThe state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\nTo calculate this, it is easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `S_y`, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of `S_y`.\nThe eigenvectors of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively. The corresponding eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y` are:\n*   `E_+y = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` (for state `|+y>`)\n*   `E_-y = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` (for state `|-y>`)\n\nNext, we express the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` in terms of the `S_y` eigenvectors. The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis eigenvectors is:\n`|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\nNow we can apply the time evolution operator:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y> ]`\n\nSince `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates, the operation is simple:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-iE_+y t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-y t/ħ)|-y> ]`\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`. Let's first calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nTo do this easily, we can convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `z`-basis. Using `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`, we substitute them into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ exp(iγBt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iγBt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formulas, `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/(2i)`, this simplifies to:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\nNow we can calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n`<S_z(t)> = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nApplying `S_z` to the ket:\n`S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>] = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nNow, taking the inner product:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] [cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nDue to the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(2 * (γBt/2))`\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is then:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for the average z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\nIn our result, `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2) cos(γBt)`, the argument of the cosine function is `γBt`.\nTherefore, the angular frequency of oscillation `Ω` is:\n`Ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The magnetic moment vector precesses about the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `Ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Oscillation Frequency Determined by Larmor Precession\n\nWhen a spin-1/2 particle, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, is suddenly subjected to a magnetic field of the same magnitude (B) in the +Y direction, the z-component of its magnetic moment will oscillate. This oscillation is a direct consequence of a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) and the magnetic field strength (B).\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is **γB**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with the Z-axis, meaning it is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-direction.\n2.  **New Dynamics**: When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-axis, the particle's magnetic moment experiences a torque. This torque causes the spin vector not to align with the new field, but to precess (or wobble) around it. This is analogous to a spinning top precessing in a gravitational field.\n3.  **Hamiltonian and Time Evolution**: The system's evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H = -μ · B = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the spin operator for the y-component. Solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation shows that the initial \"spin-up\" state evolves into a superposition of \"spin-up\" and \"spin-down\" states.\n4.  **Expectation Value**: The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the magnetic moment (<μz>) is then calculated as a function of time. This calculation reveals that <μz> oscillates.\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The resulting equation for the expectation value is of the form <μz>(t) ∝ cos(γBt). The angular frequency of this oscillation, known as the Larmor frequency, is ω = γB. This frequency is fundamental in applications like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nThe calculation confirms that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to γB. The fact that the initial state was aligned along the Z-axis and the new field is along the Y-axis causes the z-component's expectation value to vary, tracing a cosine function with this specific frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis problem describes a classic case of magnetic resonance and Larmor precession. A spin-1/2 particle, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the Z direction, is suddenly subjected to a magnetic field of the same strength but in the Y direction. This causes the particle's spin, and thus its magnetic moment, to precess around the new field direction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the particle's motion:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: At time t=0, the particle's spin is aligned with the +Z direction. This means it is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Magnetic Field**: For t > 0, the magnetic field points along the +Y direction. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, a magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque, causing it to precess around the direction of the field.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession**: This precession is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) and the magnetic field strength (B). The time evolution of the spin is a rotation around the magnetic field axis with frequency ω = γB.\n\n4.  **Motion of the Spin**: The initial spin vector is pointing along the Z-axis. The new magnetic field is along the Y-axis. Therefore, the spin vector will start to precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n\n5.  **Z-Component Oscillation**: As the spin vector rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection will oscillate between its initial maximum value and a minimum value with a cosine dependence. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will be proportional to cos(ωt).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Frequency**: The angular frequency (ω) of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency.\n    *   ω = γB\n\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the z-component of the spin (μz = γ*Sz). Therefore, the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment will also oscillate with the same angular frequency.\n\nThe oscillation is described by `cos(γBt)`, and the angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** At t=0, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Sz operator, specifically the \"spin-up\" state, denoted as |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (H) of the system for t ≥ 0 is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment (μ) and the magnetic field (B):\n    H = -μ ⋅ B\n    Since μ = γS, where S is the spin operator, and B is in the +Y direction (B = Bŷ), the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = - (γS) ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB S_y\n    Here, S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system |ψ(t)⟩ evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, the state at time t is:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of S_z:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z(t)⟩, which is given by:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n    Substituting the expression for |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| e^(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩\n\n5.  **Heisenberg Picture (Alternative approach):** It is often simpler to consider the time evolution of the operator in the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of the S_z operator is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z(t)]\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γBS_y, S_z] = (-iγB/ħ)[S_y, S_z]\n    Using the angular momentum commutation relation [S_y, S_z] = iħS_x, we get:\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħS_x) = γBS_x\n\n    Similarly, we can find the time evolution of S_x:\n    dS_x(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γBS_y, S_x] = (-iγB/ħ)[S_y, S_x]\n    Using [S_x, S_y] = iħS_z, we get [S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z.\n    dS_x(t)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħS_z) = -γBS_z\n\n6.  **Solving the Differential Equations:** We now have a system of coupled differential equations:\n    *   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩\n    *   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩\n\n    Differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation gives:\n    d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB (d⟨S_x⟩/dt) = γB (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩\n\n    This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: d²x/dt² = -ω²x. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation ω is:\n    ω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis in this case) with the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    Initially, the particle's magnetic moment `mu = gamma * S` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`, with the spin pointing up. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n    So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, so `B_vector = B * y_hat`. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system for `t > 0` is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field:\n    `H = -mu . B_vector = -(gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n    Here, `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-gamma * B * Sy) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * Sy * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n\n4.  **Work in the Eigenbasis of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    The calculation is simplest in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `Sy`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding eigenstates are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n    The energies of these states are the eigenvalues of `H`:\n    *   `E_+y = <+y|H|+y> = -gamma * B * <+y|Sy|+y> = -gamma * B * (ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_-y = <-y|H|-y> = -gamma * B * <-y|Sy|-y> = -gamma * B * (-ħ/2) = +gamma * B * (ħ/2)`\n\n    The energy difference between these two levels is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y = (gamma * B * ħ / 2) - (-gamma * B * ħ / 2) = gamma * B * ħ`.\n\n5.  **Express the Initial State in the New Basis:**\n    We need to write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the standard `Sz` basis:\n    `|+z> = [1, 0]`\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * [1, i]`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * [1, -i]`\n    From these, we can find that:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time-Evolved State:**\n    Now we apply the time evolution operator to the initial state expressed in the `Sy` basis:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y>]`\n    Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-i*E_+y*t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i*E_-y*t/ħ)|-y>]`\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(i * gamma * B * t / 2)|+y> + exp(-i * gamma * B * t / 2)|-y>]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`.\n    `<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| gamma * Sz |ψ(t)> = gamma * <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n\n    To calculate `<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`, it's convenient to switch `|ψ(t)>` back to the `Sz` basis.

The expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the magnetic field `B` at the Larmor frequency `ω = gamma * B`. Since the spin starts along the Z-axis and the field is along the Y-axis, the Z-component of the spin will oscillate as `cos(ωt)`, and the oscillation frequency is `ω`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics and the derivation of the answer.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`)**\n    *   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment operator is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, a magnetic field `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The energy eigenvalues of `H_initial` are `-γB(m_s ħ)`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n    *   To minimize the energy, `m_s` must be `+1/2` (assuming a positive `γ`, as is conventional). Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z>` is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`, this is the initial state vector.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (`t ≥ 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the field is switched to `B_new = B ĵ` in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution of the system, is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time-evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting our Hamiltonian `H`:\n        `U(t) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y / ħ)`\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n        `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n    *   We can expand this exponential operator using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = I cos(θ) + iσ_n sin(θ)`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `θ = γBt/2`.\n    *   The state vector at time `t` becomes:\n        `|ψ(t)> = [I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)] |+z>`\n    *   We know that `σ_y |+z>` gives `i|-z>`. Substituting this:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> + i sin(γBt/2) (i|-z>) = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Moment**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we first calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   `S_z` acts on its eigenstates: `S_z|+z> = +(ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`, etc.), the expression simplifies to:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos²(γBt/2) - (ħ/2)sin²(γBt/2)`\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A function of the form `A cos(ωt)` has an angular frequency of `ω`.\n    *   By inspection, the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation of `<μ_z(t)>` is `γB`.

The expectation value of the magnetic moment of the particle will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the +Y axis) at a specific frequency, known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin is aligned with the Z-axis. When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-axis, the spin vector begins to precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz⟩, therefore oscillates.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, in a magnetic field **B** is given by the equation:\n\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ (⟨**S**⟩ × **B**)\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThis equation shows that the spin vector precesses around the magnetic field vector **B** with an angular frequency of:\n\nω = γB\n\nThis angular frequency is the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's break down the components. The magnetic field is **B** = B**ŷ**. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (⟨Sx⟩, ⟨Sy⟩, ⟨Sz⟩). The cross product results in a set of differential equations:\n*   d⟨Sx⟩/dt = -γB⟨Sz⟩\n*   d⟨Sy⟩/dt = 0\n*   d⟨Sz⟩/dt = γB⟨Sx⟩\n\nTaking the time derivative of the third equation and substituting the first equation into it, we get:\n\nd²⟨Sz⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨Sx⟩/dt) = γB(-γB⟨Sz⟩) = -(γB)²⟨Sz⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency ω is γB. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (`μ = γS`). For the moment to be aligned with the field and the energy to be minimized, the spin must be in the \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as `|+Z>`.\n\n2.  **Change in System**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude, `B`.\n\n3.  **New Hamiltonian**: The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field: `H = -μ · B`. With the new field, this becomes `H = - (γS) · (Bŷ) = -γB S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution**: The initial state `|+Z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time. The expectation value (or average) of any measurement will change. The spin vector will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This precession is called Larmor precession.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. For a magnetic moment `μ = γS` in a magnetic field `B`, the Larmor frequency is given by `ω = |γB|`.\n\n6.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component**: As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The spin starts aligned with `+Z`. As it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will decrease, pass through zero, become negative, and then return to its starting position. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor precession frequency.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z(t)>`, can be calculated to be `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nThe term `cos(γBt)` shows that the value oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nMy analysis confirms that the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency. The phenomenon of a magnetic moment precessing around an external magnetic field is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by the equation ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nIn this problem, the particle's spin is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the z-direction, meaning its spin state is an eigenstate of the z-component of the spin operator, Sz. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction. This precession means that the expectation value of the spin's components in the x and z directions will oscillate.\n\nAs derived through three independent methods in the thought process (Schrödinger picture, Heisenberg picture, and Ehrenfest's theorem), the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz(t)⟩`, will oscillate according to the function `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of the time variable `t`, which is `γB`. This result is a standard outcome in quantum mechanics problems involving spin in a magnetic field.\n\nThe different methods of calculation all yield the same governing differential equation for the expectation value of the z-component of spin, `⟨Sz⟩`:\n\n`d²⟨Sz⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨Sz⟩`\n\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThis is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. The z-component is μz = γSz.\n*   The magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this system is H₀ = -**μ** · **B** = -γB Sz.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of H₀ are the eigenstates of Sz, which are |+z⟩ (spin up) and |-z⟩ (spin down).\n    *   The energy for |+z⟩ (eigenvalue Sz = +ħ/2) is E_up = -γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The energy for |-z⟩ (eigenvalue Sz = -ħ/2) is E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n*   The lowest energy state is E_up, corresponding to the spin-up state |+z⟩.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n**2. Time Evolution (t > 0)**\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB Sy.\n*   The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩.\n*   Substituting H' and |ψ(0)⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB Sy)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt Sy/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n**3. Calculating the Expectation Value ⟨μz⟩(t)**\n\nWe want to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t).\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt Sy/ħ) Sz exp(iγBt Sy/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\nThis calculation can be done in a few ways.\n\n**Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The time-evolved Sz operator, Sz(t), is given by:\nSz(t) = U†SzU, where U = exp(iγBt Sy/ħ).\n\nThe operator U represents a rotation of the spin around the Y-axis by an angle θ = γBt. The transformation for the spin operators under such a rotation is:\n*   Sx(t) = Sx cos(θ) - Sz sin(θ)\n*   Sy(t) = Sy\n*   Sz(t) = Sz cos(θ) + Sx sin(θ)\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz cos(γBt) + Sx sin(γBt).\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value using the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩:\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(0)| Sz(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = ⟨+z| (Sz cos(γBt) + Sx sin(γBt)) |+z⟩\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = cos(γBt) ⟨+z|Sz|+z⟩ + sin(γBt) ⟨+z|Sx|+z⟩\n\nWe know the following:\n*   |+z⟩ is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, ⟨+z|Sz|+z⟩ = ħ/2.\n*   The matrix for Sx in the Sz basis is Sx = (ħ/2)[[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So, Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|-z⟩. This means ⟨+z|Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0, since |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ are orthogonal.\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) + sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\nThe average of the z-component of the moment is:\n⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\n**4. Determining the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe expression for ⟨μz⟩(t) is a cosine function of time: `A cos(ωt)`. By comparing this with our result, ⟨μz⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt), we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is ω = γB.\n\n**Method 2: Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\nClassically, a magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** experiences a torque **τ** = **μ** × **B**. This torque causes the angular momentum (in this case, the spin **S**) to precess according to d**S**/dt = **τ**. Since **μ** = γ**S**, we have:\nd**μ**/dt = γ(**μ** × **B**)\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the magnetic moment vector **μ** around the magnetic field vector **B**. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, given by:\nωL = γB\n\nInitially, the moment **μ** is along the +Z axis. When the field is switched to the +Y axis, the moment vector starts to precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis will vary as cos(ωLt). Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component is the Larmor frequency, ωL = γB.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment (and thus its spin) is in an eigenstate along the +z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +y direction, the spin vector begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`\nwhere `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThis equation indicates that the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` at an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial spin expectation vector points along the +z axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` points along the +y axis.\n*   Therefore, the spin vector will precess around the y-axis. As it rotates in the x-z plane, its projection onto the z-axis (the z-component) will oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of this precession, and consequently the oscillation frequency of its z-component, is the Larmor frequency. The formula for the Larmor frequency `ω` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\nHere, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. The search results confirm that this precessional motion and its corresponding frequency are fundamental concepts in magnetic resonance and spin dynamics.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `⟨Sz⟩`, will oscillate as `cos(γBt)`. Thus, the angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the correct oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the oscillation frequency.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\nThe particle is spin-1/2 and is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin up\" state corresponding to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics notation, the initial state vector `|ψ(0)>` is the eigenstate of the spin-Z operator `S_z` with a positive eigenvalue, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n\n**2. New Hamiltonian:**\nAt time `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The interaction energy of a magnetic moment `μ` with a magnetic field `B` is given by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (`μ = γS`), the new Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution is `H = -γ * B * S_y`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, `B` is the magnetic field magnitude, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n**3. Time Evolution of Expectation Value:**\nWe are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is given by `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. To find this, we need to calculate how the expectation value of the spin operator `S_z` evolves in time, i.e., `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nUsing the laws of quantum mechanics (either the Schrödinger picture by evolving the state vector or the Heisenberg picture by evolving the operator), one can derive the time dependence of `<S_z>(t)`. The result of this calculation is:\n`<S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) * cos(γBt)`\n\n**4. Identifying the Frequency:**\nFrom the result above, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(0) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThis equation describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` (omega) is the angular frequency. By comparing this general form to our result, we can see that the oscillation frequency `ω` is equal to `γB`.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this conclusion to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_spin_precession():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the oscillation frequency of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment.\n    \n    The problem describes Larmor precession.

The relationship between its magnetic moment vector `μ` and its spin vector `S` is given by `μ = γS`. This means the components are related as `μ_x = γS_x`, `μ_y = γS_y`, and `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is initially in a uniform magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction). The interaction Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ . B_vec = -γS . (B * z_hat) = -γB S_z`.\n*   **\"Aligned\" with the Field:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This implies the system is in its lowest possible energy state. The energy levels of `H_initial` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+>_z`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|->_z`).\n    *   Energy of `|+>_z`: `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Energy of `|->_z`: `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` (the gyromagnetic ratio) is positive, the lower energy state is `E_+`. This corresponds to the spin-up state `|+>_z`. In this state, the expectation value of the spin `S_z` is `+ħ/2`, and the expectation value of the magnetic moment `μ_z` is `+γħ/2`, which points in the same direction as the magnetic field `B_vec`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the New Hamiltonian and the Dynamics\n*   **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the +Y direction. So, for `t>0`, the magnetic field is `B_vec_new = B * y_hat`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution for `t>0` is `H_new = -μ . B_vec_new = -γS . (B * y_hat) = -γB S_y`.\n*   **System Dynamics:** The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z` is an eigenstate of `S_z`, but it is *not* an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (which depends on `S_y`). Because the state is not a stationary state of the new Hamiltonian, it will evolve in time according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This time evolution manifests as a precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`.\n\nWe can use the general equation for the time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector in a magnetic field (Ehrenfest's theorem), which describes Larmor precession:\n`d<S>/dt = γ <S> x B_vec`\n\nFor our system with `B_vec = B * y_hat`:\n`d<S>/dt = γ (<S_x>x_hat + <S_y>y_hat + <S_z>z_hat) x (B * y_hat)`\n`d<S>/dt = γB [ <S_x>(x_hat x y_hat) + <S_z>(z_hat x y_hat) ]`\n`d<S>/dt = γB [ <S_x>z_hat - <S_z>x_hat ]`\n\nThis gives us a set of coupled differential equations for the components of `<S>`:\n1.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n2.  `d<S_y>/dt = 0`\n3.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n\nWe also need the initial values at `t=0`:\n*   `<S_z>(0) = <+|_z S_z |+>_z = +ħ/2`\n*   `<S_x>(0) = <+|_z S_x |+>_z = 0`\n*   `<S_y>(0) = <+|_z S_y |+>_z = 0`\n\nNow we solve the differential equations. Let's focus on `<S_z>(t)`.\nTake the time derivative of equation (3):\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)`\n\nSubstitute equation (1) into this:\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>)`\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\nBy comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>(t)` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<S_z>(t)`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. The full solution is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nConsequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`, also oscillates with the same frequency. This frequency, `ω = γB`, is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe options provided are in units of angular frequency, so the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Initial State:** Correctly identifying the initial state as `|+>_z` based on the \"alignment\" with the Z-field (lowest energy state).\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** Correctly identifying the Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y` that governs the time evolution after the field is switched.\n*   **Dynamics:** Recognizing that the non-eigenstate `|+>_z` will evolve, leading to precession around the new field axis (Y-axis).\n*   **Observable:** Understanding that the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *expectation value* `<μ_z>(t)`.\n*   **Frequency:** The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe user has provided the output from the Python code execution.

The magnetic moment of a particle in an external magnetic field will precess about the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin component along any axis is quantized, with possible values of +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ · B`. For the new field, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a time `t` after the switch is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`, where `|ψ(0)⟩` is the initial state `|+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Larmor Precession**: The new Hamiltonian causes the spin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω = γ * B`.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of `<Sz>`**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`. As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial spin was entirely along the Z-axis. As it rotates away from the Z-axis and then back towards it, the value of `<Sz>` changes.\n\nThe frequency of this oscillation is precisely the frequency of the Larmor precession. The angular frequency `ω` of this oscillation is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`. The calculation shows that the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a spin magnetic moment µ aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction, Sz. We can represent this \"spin up\" state as:\n    |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian of the System:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction with magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (H) of a magnetic moment (µ) in a magnetic field (B) is given by H = -µ · B. Since µ = γS, where S is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = -γS · B = -γB S<sub>y</sub>\n\n    Here, S<sub>y</sub> is the spin operator for the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:** The state of the particle at any time *t* is determined by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e<sup>-iHt/ħ</sup> |ψ(0)⟩ = e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> |+z⟩\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:** We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the Z-component of the spin, ⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩, as a function of time. This is calculated as:\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S<sub>z</sub> |ψ(t)⟩\n\n    To solve this, we can express the operators and states in matrix form. In the S<sub>z</sub> basis, the spin operators and the initial state are:\n\n    S<sub>z</sub> = (ħ/2) *  [ 1  0 ]\n                     [ 0 -1 ]\n\n    S<sub>y</sub> = (ħ/2) *  [ 0 -i ]\n                     [ i  0 ]\n\n    |+z⟩ = [ 1 ]\n            [ 0 ]\n\n    The time evolution operator e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> simplifies to:\n    e<sup>i(γBt/2)σ<sub>y</sub></sup> = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ<sub>y</sub>\n\n    where σ<sub>y</sub> is the Pauli Y matrix and I is the identity matrix. This gives:\n\n    e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> = [ cos(γBt/2)  sin(γBt/2) ]\n                      [ -sin(γBt/2) cos(γBt/2) ]\n\n5.  **Finding the State at Time t:**\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)  sin(γBt/2) ] [ 1 ] = [ cos(γBt/2)  ]\n              [ -sin(γBt/2) cos(γBt/2) ] [ 0 ]   [ -sin(γBt/2) ]\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩:**\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)  -sin(γBt/2) ] * (ħ/2) [ 1  0 ] * [ cos(γBt/2)  ]\n                                                     [ 0 -1 ]   [ -sin(γBt/2) ]\n\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ cos(γBt/2)  -sin(γBt/2) ] * [ cos(γBt/2)   ]\n                                                     [ sin(γBt/2)   ]\n\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n7.  **Determining the Oscillation Frequency:** The expression for ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ shows that the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The oscillation is a direct consequence of the spin precessing around the new magnetic field direction.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is therefore γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThis problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is in a spin-up state along the Z-axis. Its state vector `|ψ(0)>` is an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `S_z`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is switched to the Y-direction, `B = B_y`. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ · B = - (γS_y) * B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator in the y-direction.\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The particle's spin state evolves over time. This evolution is equivalent to the spin vector precessing around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis).\n4.  **Oscillation of <μ_z>**: The z-component of the magnetic moment is proportional to the expectation value of the spin operator `S_z`. As the spin precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate.\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by the formula `ω = γB`. This is the frequency at which the expectation value of any spin component perpendicular to the magnetic field will oscillate.\n\nSince the initial spin is along the Z-axis and the new magnetic field is along the Y-axis, the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as it precesses around the Y-axis. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this system is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **μ** = γ**S** is the magnetic moment operator and **S** is the spin operator.\n*   Substituting the values, H₀ = -γ(**S** ⋅ B **ẑ**) = -γB S₂.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   The eigenvalues of S₂ are +ħ/2 (spin-up, |↑⟩₂) and -ħ/2 (spin-down, |↓⟩₂).\n*   The energy levels are E = -γB mₛħ, where mₛ = ±1/2.\n    *   E₊ (for spin-up, mₛ=+1/2): -γB(ħ/2)\n    *   E₋ (for spin-down, mₛ=-1/2): +γB(ħ/2)\n*   Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy state is E₊, which corresponds to the spin-up state |↑⟩₂.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩₂. In the standard S₂ basis, this is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2.

The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution\n\nWe want to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ₂(t)⟩, which is equal to γ⟨S₂(t)⟩.\n⟨S₂(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S₂ |ψ(t)⟩.\n\n#### Method 1: Heisenberg Picture (Equation of Motion)\n\nA more direct way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin operators (Ehrenfest's theorem).\n\nThe equation of motion for an operator A is d⟨A⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩.\nOur Hamiltonian is H = -γB Sᵧ.\n\n1.  **For ⟨S₂⟩:**\n    d⟨S₂⟩/dt = (1/iħ) ⟨[S₂, H]⟩ = (1/iħ) ⟨[S₂, -γB Sᵧ]⟩ = (-γB/iħ) ⟨[S₂, Sᵧ]⟩\n    Using the commutation relation [Sᵧ, S₂] = iħ Sₓ, we get [S₂, Sᵧ] = -iħ Sₓ.\n    d⟨S₂⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ ⟨Sₓ⟩) = γB ⟨Sₓ⟩.\n\n2.  **For ⟨Sₓ⟩:**\n    d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = (1/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, H]⟩ = (1/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, -γB Sᵧ]⟩ = (-γB/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, Sᵧ]⟩\n    Using the commutation relation [Sₓ, Sᵧ] = iħ S₂, we get:\n    d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ ⟨S₂⟩) = -γB ⟨S₂⟩.\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations:\n(i) d⟨S₂⟩/dt = γB ⟨Sₓ⟩\n(ii) d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = -γB ⟨S₂⟩\n\nTo solve this, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = γB (d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt)\n\nNow substitute equation (ii) into this:\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = γB (-γB ⟨S₂⟩)\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = -(γB)² ⟨S₂⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x.\nBy comparing the two equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation ω is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) at an angular frequency ω = γB, which is the Larmor frequency. The projection of this precessing vector onto any other axis (like the z-axis) will oscillate with this same angular frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the \"oscillation frequency\". Given the context of physics problems and the form of the answers, this refers to the angular frequency ω.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, ⟨μ₂(t)⟩ = γ⟨S₂(t)⟩, oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The particle is spin-1/2. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   The magnetic moment is given as `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator. So `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ_z B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenvalues of the `S_z` operator are `+ħ/2` (spin-up, `|↑⟩_z`) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down, `|↓⟩_z`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E = -γB (±ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field, the particle must be in its lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy `E = -γB(ħ/2)` corresponds to the spin-up state, `S_z = +ħ/2`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up state in the Z-direction:\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `|↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]`, this is the initial state vector.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B' = -μ_y B = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n*   Substituting the Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n*   The spin operator `S_y` can be written in terms of the Pauli matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n*   The time evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iγBt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the State at Time `t`\n*   We need to evaluate the exponential of the Pauli matrix. A useful identity is `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `σ_k` is any Pauli matrix and `I` is the identity matrix.\n*   In our case, `θ = γBt/2`. So, `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n*   Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]) [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]) [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(γBt/2)|↓⟩_z`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Moment\n*   We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`.\n*   `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   First, let's find `S_z|ψ(t)⟩`:\n    `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]] = (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Next, we calculate the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. The bra `⟨ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|ψ(t)⟩`, so `⟨ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n*   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expression for `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time `t`.\n*   A general oscillation is of the form `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n*   `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The z-component of the spin therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThis problem describes the quantum mechanical phenomenon of Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n**1. Define the Initial State (at t=0):**\n\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment is a vector operator given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ**, pointing along the positive z-axis.\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) for this situation is H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = -γS_zB.\n*   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with this field. In quantum mechanics, this means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The energy eigenvalues are E = -γB(m_sħ), where m_s = ±1/2. Assuming γ is positive, the lowest energy occurs when the spin projection `m_s` is maximum, which is +1/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle is the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis. We denote this quantum state as |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n**2. Define the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the positive y-axis: **B'** = B**ŷ**.\n*   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the particle's evolution for t > 0, is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γS_yB.\n\n**3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n\nThe expectation value of an observable (like the z-component of the magnetic moment) oscillates when the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates of the governing Hamiltonian. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between these states.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian, H'.**\n    The Hamiltonian H' = -γBS_y is proportional to the S_y spin operator. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y, denoted as |+y⟩ (spin-up along y) and |-y⟩ (spin-down along y).\n    *   The eigenvalues of S_y are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of H' are:\n        *   E₊ = -γB(ħ/2)  (for the state |+y⟩)\n        *   E₋ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2) (for the state |-y⟩)\n\n*   **Step 2: Express the initial state in the new energy basis.**\n    The initial state is |+z⟩. We need to write this as a combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The standard basis transformation is:\n    |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)\n    This shows that the initial state is an equal superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the Bohr Frequency Condition.**\n    When a quantum system is in a superposition of two energy states with energies E₁ and E₂, the system will oscillate between them with an angular frequency (ω) given by the energy difference:\n    ω = |E₁ - E₂| / ħ\n\n    Let's calculate this for our system:\n    *   Energy Difference: ΔE = |E₊ - E₋| = |-γBħ/2 - (+γBħ/2)| = |-γBħ| = γBħ\n    *   Oscillation Frequency: ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nThis frequency, ω = γB, is known as the **Larmor frequency**. The expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, starts by pointing along the z-axis and then precesses in the x-z plane around the y-axis (the direction of the new field) at this frequency. The z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩(t), will therefore oscillate according to cos(γBt).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` in the cosine term, which is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThis is a classic quantum mechanics problem describing the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (at t=0):**\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, **B** = B**ẑ**.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The spin operator S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding energies are E = -γB(±ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming γ (the gyromagnetic ratio) and B are positive, the lowest energy corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of S_z, which is +ħ/2. This is the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the particle at t=0 is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.\n\n2.  **Analyze the System for t > 0:**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B**ŷ**.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y.\n    *   According to the \"sudden approximation,\" the state vector of the system does not change at the instant the Hamiltonian is switched. So, the state at t=0+ is still |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.\n\n3.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency (Method 1: Energy Gap):**\n    *   The initial state |↑⟩_z is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H (which is proportional to S_y). Therefore, the state will evolve in time.\n    *   The state can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H. The time evolution of such a superposition leads to oscillations in the expectation values of observables (like the z-component of the magnetic moment).\n    *   The angular frequency (ω) of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference (ΔE) between the energy levels of the new Hamiltonian, according to the Bohr frequency condition: ω = ΔE/ħ.\n    *   The energy levels of H = -γBS_y are determined by the eigenvalues of S_y, which are also +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n        *   Energy level 1 (eigenvalue +ħ/2 for S_y): E₁ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2.\n        *   Energy level 2 (eigenvalue -ħ/2 for S_y): E₂ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2.\n    *   The energy difference between these two levels is:\n        ΔE = E₂ - E₁ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ.\n    *   The oscillation frequency is therefore:\n        ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB.\n    *   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Verification with Symbolic Computation:**\n    We can use a Python script with `sympy` to verify the calculation of the frequency from the energy gap.\n\n    ```python\n    import sympy\n    \n    # Define symbols for the physical quantities. hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2*pi.\n    hbar, gamma, B = sympy.symbols('hbar gamma B', real=True, positive=True)\n    \n    # The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * S_y. Its energy levels are its eigenvalues.\n    # The eigenvalues of the spin operator S_y are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.\n    # The energy eigenvalues of H are therefore:\n    E1 = -gamma * B * (hbar / 2)\n    E2 = -gamma * B * (-hbar / 2)\n    \n    # The energy difference between the two eigenstates determines the oscillation frequency.\n    Delta_E = E2 - E1\n    \n    # The oscillation angular frequency omega is given by the Bohr frequency condition: omega = Delta_E / hbar.\n    omega = Delta_E / hbar\n    \n    # Print the resulting frequency.\n    print(omega)\n    \n    ```\n\n5.  **Confirmation and Final Answer:**\n    The code output, `B*gamma`, confirms our derivation.

This means the initial state of the particle's spin, at time t=0, is the \"spin up\" state along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Magnetic Field:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude, B. The Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of the system, is now determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment (μ) with this new magnetic field. The Hamiltonian H is given by H = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ĵ**) = -γB*S<sub>y</sub>, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S<sub>y</sub> is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** According to quantum mechanics, the expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the spin, <S<sub>z</sub>>, evolves in time. Its rate of change is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion, which leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components:\n    *   d<S<sub>z</sub>>/dt = γB <S<sub>x</sub>>\n    *   d<S<sub>x</sub>>/dt = -γB <S<sub>z</sub>>\n\n4.  **Solving for the Frequency:** By differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation into it, we arrive at a second-order differential equation for <S<sub>z</sub>>:\n    *   d²<S<sub>z</sub>>/dt² = - (γB)² <S<sub>z</sub>>\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the oscillation frequency ω as:\n    *   ω = γB\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>> = γ<S<sub>z</sub>>, will therefore oscillate with an angular frequency of γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes its angular momentum vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) for a magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. Since the magnetic moment is related to the spin angular momentum **S** by **μ** = γ**S** (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ(Sy * B), where Sy is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at time *t*, |ψ(t)⟩, is given by applying the time evolution operator to the initial state: |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩. In this case, the state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i * γ * B * t * Sy / ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz(t)⟩. This is calculated as ⟨ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)⟩. The operator μz is equal to γ*Sz. As the state |ψ(t)⟩ evolves, this expectation value changes.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Oscillation**: The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of spin, ⟨Sz(t)⟩, oscillates as cos(γBt). The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to this: ⟨μz(t)⟩ ∝ cos(γBt).\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency**: The term inside the cosine function is ωt, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing this to the calculated expression, we can identify the angular frequency ω as γB. This frequency, known as the Larmor frequency, is independent of the initial orientation of the spin relative to the field.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    Initially, the spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, S_z. We'll assume it's the \"spin up\" state, denoted as `|+z⟩`. The magnetic moment is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin vector operator.\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian:**\n    The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system describes the interaction energy between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, given by H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    With the magnetic field **B** = B**ŷ** (where **ŷ** is the unit vector in the Y direction), the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = -γ(S_x **x̂** + S_y **ŷ** + S_z **ẑ**) · (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\n    where `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n    We can calculate the exponential of the Hamiltonian operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n    H = -γB(ħ/2)σ_y.\n    The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp[-i(-γB(ħ/2)σ_y)t/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y]`.\n\n    Using the identity for Pauli matrices, `exp(iθn·σ) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)n·σ`, where **n** is a unit vector. Here, θ = γBt/2 and **n** is the y-direction vector **ŷ**.\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n\n    The initial state `|+z⟩` is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`. Applying the evolution operator:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y] [[1], [0]]`\n    Since σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, this becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\n    This is the state of the particle at time `t`. In the `|+z⟩`, `|-z⟩` basis, it is:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. We need to calculate `⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n    The S_z operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n    This expression describes an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω`. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt)`. By comparing, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n    ω = γB.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The projection of this precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics that describes the phenomenon of **Larmor precession**.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to its spin `S` via the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`, such that `μ = γS`. Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The interaction energy is described by the Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it occupies the lowest possible energy state. For the energy `E = -γB S_z` to be minimal (assuming `γ > 0`), the value of the spin projection `S_z` must be maximal. For a spin-1/2 particle, this corresponds to the \"spin-up\" state, `|+z>`, which has a spin projection eigenvalue of `+ħ/2`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, so `B_new = B ŷ`. The Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (since `S_z` and `S_y` do not commute). Therefore, the state is not stationary and will evolve in time. This time evolution corresponds to the physical phenomenon of the spin precessing around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Oscillation Frequency:** The frequency of this precession is known as the **Larmor frequency**. There are several ways to derive it:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Energy Splitting (Bohr Frequency)**\n        The initial state `|+z>` is a superposition of the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H_new = -γB S_y` are the spin-up `|+y>` and spin-down `|-y>` states along the y-axis.\n        *   The energy of the `|+y>` state is `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n        *   The energy of the `|-y>` state is `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n        The oscillation frequency `ω` of any observable is given by the difference in energy between the two states that form the superposition:\n        `ω = ΔE / ħ = (E_(-) - E_(+)) / ħ = (γBħ/2 - (-γBħ/2)) / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Equations of Motion)**\n        One can look at the time evolution of the expectation value of the spin operator, `⟨S⟩`. The governing equation is `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ (⟨S⟩ x B)`. This describes precession around `B` with angular frequency `ω = γB`. Since the z-component of the spin, `⟨S_z⟩`, is perpendicular to the new field `B` along the y-axis, it will oscillate as the spin precesses. The detailed calculation leads to the second-order differential equation for `⟨S_z⟩`:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = -(γB)² ⟨S_z⟩`\n        This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, where the angular frequency is clearly `ω = γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Schrödinger Picture (Explicit Calculation)**\n        A full calculation of the time-evolved state `|ψ(t)>` and the expectation value `<μ_z(t)>` yields the result:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n        This expression shows a sinusoidal oscillation. The angular frequency `ω` is the coefficient of the time variable `t` inside the cosine function. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"** means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **\"Suddenly\"** implies the quantum state does not have time to change at the moment the field is switched, a principle known as the sudden approximation.\n*   The physical phenomenon is **Larmor precession**, and the oscillation frequency is the **Larmor frequency**.\n*   All valid methods of derivation consistently yield the same result.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is **γB**.

This equation describes the precession of the magnetic moment vector `μ` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n*   The magnitude of the angular frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   In our case, at `t=0`, the magnetic moment is aligned with the Z-axis (`μ(0)` is in the +Z direction).\n*   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is along the Y-axis.\n*   Therefore, the magnetic moment vector `μ` will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment, `μz`, will oscillate as the vector precesses. If the angle of precession is `θ(t) = ωt`, then `μz(t) = |μ| * cos(ωt)`.\n*   The oscillation frequency is simply the precession frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Heisenberg Picture)\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the state remains fixed as `|+z>`, while the operators evolve in time. The time evolution of the `Sz` operator is given by a rotation around the y-axis (the direction of the new field `B`) by an angle `θ = γBt`.\n\n`Sz(t) = Sz(0)cos(γBt) - Sx(0)sin(γBt)`\n\nNow, we find the expectation value of `Sz(t)` in the initial state `|+z>`:\n`<Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z> = <+z| (Sz cos(γBt) - Sx sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n`<Sz(t)> = cos(γBt) <+z| Sz |+z> - sin(γBt) <+z| Sx |+z>`\n\nWe know the following for a spin-up state:\n*   `<+z| Sz |+z> = ħ/2` (The state is an eigenstate of `Sz`).\n*   `<+z| Sx |+z> = 0` (The expectation value of `Sx` in an eigenstate of `Sz` is zero).\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n`<Sz(t)> = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) - sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ * (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe average value oscillates with a function `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the classical analogy and the full quantum mechanical calculation show that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has spin 1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate with respect to the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field:\n    `H = -μ · B = -γ(Sx*Bx + Sy*By + Sz*Bz)`\n    Since the new field is `B = Bĵ`, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n    `H = -γB * Sy`\n    where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t)`. To find this, we need to calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin oscillates as:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    `<μz>(t) = γ * <Sz>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe term `cos(γBt)` describes an oscillation. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at this frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution to the quantum mechanics problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (t < 0)**\nThe particle has a spin 1/2 and is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -mu . B = -gamma * B * Sz`. The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (energy `-gamma*B*hbar/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (energy `+gamma*B*hbar/2`). The lowest energy state is `|+z>`. So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n**2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)**\nThe magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -mu . B = -gamma * B * Sy`.\n\n**3. Time Evolution of the State**\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by `|psi(t)> = U(t)|psi(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar)` is the time evolution operator. To calculate this, it's easiest to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (i.e., the eigenbasis of `Sy`).\n*   The eigenstates of `Sy` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   We can write `|+z>` as a superposition: `|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n*   Applying the time evolution operator to this superposition, the state evolves as:\n    `|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (exp(-i*E_+y*t/hbar)|+y> + exp(-i*E_-y*t/hbar)|-y>)`\n    where `E_+y` and `E_-y` are the energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   After substituting the energy values and converting back to the Z-basis, we find:\n    `|psi(t)> = cos(gamma*B*t/2)|+z> - sin(gamma*B*t/2)|-z>`\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value**\nWe need the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<mu_z>(t) = <psi(t)| gamma*Sz |psi(t)>`.\n*   Calculating this gives: `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * (hbar/2) * (cos^2(gamma*B*t/2) - sin^2(gamma*B*t/2))`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, this simplifies to:\n    `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * (hbar/2) * cos(gamma*B*t)`\n\n**5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\nThe expectation value `<mu_z>(t)` oscillates as `cos(Omega*t)`, where `Omega` is the angular frequency. By comparing this form to our result, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `Omega = gamma * B`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this logic and prints the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spin_precession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the oscillation frequency of a spin-1/2 particle's\n    magnetic moment in a changing magnetic field.\n\n    Problem Setup:\n    1.

The z-component is μ_z = γS_z.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The eigenstates of S_z are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest possible energy state. Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy is E_up.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the z-axis: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The old field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B**ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n    *   The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the system does not have time to change at the moment of the switch. So, the state at t=0+ is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    *   For all t > 0, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: H_new = -**μ** · **B'** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the State (for t > 0):**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for H_new and `|ψ(0)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) * |+z>`\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector, which was initially pointing along the +Z axis, around the new magnetic field direction (the +Y axis). The angular velocity of this precession is the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, we can express the initial state `|+z>` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (i.e., the eigenstates of S_y).\n    *   The eigenstates of S_y are `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the S_z basis:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   We can write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   The energies corresponding to the S_y eigenstates are:\n        E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)\n        E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)\n    *   Now, we evolve the state in time:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_{+y}t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_{-y}t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   To find `<S_z>(t)`, we substitute the S_y eigenstates back in terms of S_z eigenstates. After some algebra (using Euler's formula `cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2` and `sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/(2i)`), we get:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<S_z>(t)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * S_z * [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * [cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The time-dependent part of this expression is `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   An oscillation of the form `cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency of `Ω`.\n    *   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(Ωt)`, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **\"Suddenly\"**: This is the key to using the sudden approximation, which states that the wavefunction does not change at the instant the Hamiltonian changes.\n*   **Observable**: The question asks for the oscillation of the *average of the z-component of the moment* (`<μ_z>`), not the spin (`<S_z>`). However, since they are related by a constant factor (`γ`), their oscillation frequency is the same.\n*   **Frequency**: In physics, \"frequency\" in this context almost always refers to the angular frequency (in radians per second), not the ordinary frequency (in Hertz). The options confirm this. The phenomenon described is Larmor precession, and the frequency `γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n\nOscillation Frequency = γB\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the output of a symbolic calculation for the problem. Let's analyze this output to determine the final answer.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Problem Statement:** We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`. The particle starts aligned with a Z-field, which is then suddenly switched to a Y-field of the same magnitude `B`.\n\n2.  **Initial State:** The particle is initially in the spin-up state along the z-axis, `|+z>`. This is the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -γB S_z`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian `H_new = -γB S_y`. The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in `<μ_z>(t) = γ <S_z>(t) = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Code Output:** The provided code output is the result of calculating `<μ_z>(t)`:\n    `0.5*gamma*hbar*cos(1.0*B*gamma*t)`\n\n    Let's rewrite this in a more standard physics notation:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = (1/2) * γ * ħ * cos(B * γ * t)`\n    `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`\n\n6.  **Identifying the Oscillation Frequency:** The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A general oscillatory function is written as `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where:\n    *   `A` is the amplitude of oscillation.\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `φ` is the phase shift.\n\n    Comparing our result, `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`, with the general form, we can identify the components:\n    *   Amplitude `A = γħ/2`\n    *   Angular frequency `ω = γB`\n    *   Phase shift `φ = 0`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency `ω`. From our analysis of the code output, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n8.  **Matching with Options:**\n    A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B\n    C) gamma*B/2\n    D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\n    The calculated frequency `γB` matches option B. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment, such as that of a spin-1/2 particle, is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Change of Field (t = 0):** The magnetic field is instantaneously switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n\n3.  **Precession (t > 0):** The magnetic moment, which was initially pointing along the Z-axis, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This precession occurs in the X-Z plane.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:** As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection will oscillate between its initial maximum value, through zero, to a minimum value, and back.\n\nThe angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω`, which is given by the formula:\n\n`ω = γB`\n\nwhere:\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThis frequency `ω` is precisely the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. The search results confirm that for a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is `γB`. This is a standard result in quantum mechanics and magnetic resonance. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>`, can be calculated to be proportional to `cos(γBt)`, which explicitly shows an oscillation with angular frequency `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, `Sz`. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is given by `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S` by the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` (i.e., `μ = γS`), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`.\n\nIn this problem, the new magnetic field is `B = Bŷ`, so the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`, where `Sy` is the Y-component of the spin operator.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of any spin component will be an oscillation. This is the quantum mechanical analogue of Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate as `cos(γBt)`. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe physical process described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle has a spin magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin angular momentum operator. The magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (in the +Z direction). The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field, meaning it is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis. This is the lowest energy eigenstate for the initial Hamiltonian H = -γB S_z.\n\n2.  **Change in Hamiltonian (t = 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B** = B**ŷ** (in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the system is H' = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):** The initial spin state (spin-up along Z) is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The spin vector will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This precession occurs in the X-Z plane.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of ⟨μ_z⟩:** As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, will vary sinusoidally.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The rate of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, ω. The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field B and the gyromagnetic ratio γ. The formula for the angular frequency of precession is ω = γB.\n\nA detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this result. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is found to be ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). Consequently, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt). The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of *t* inside the cosine function, which is γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ⃗ = γS⃗`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S⃗` is the spin operator.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B⃗ = B ẑ`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ⃗ ⋅ B⃗ = -γ(S⃗ ⋅ B ẑ) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is `E_up`.

Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle is in a magnetic field `B_z = B * z_hat`. Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ . B_z = -γ * S_z * B`. Since the moment is aligned, the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state vector is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n*   **Final State (t > 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_y = B * y_hat`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ . B_y = -γ * S_y * B`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. The time-evolved state `|ψ(t)>` is given by:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / hbar) |ψ(t=0)>`\nSubstituting the expressions for `H_new` and `|ψ(t=0)>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / hbar) |+z>`\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / hbar) |+z>`\n\nThis expression describes a rotation of the initial state `|+z>` around the Y-axis by an angle `θ(t) = γ * B * t`. This physical phenomenon is known as **Larmor precession**. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, will precess around the new magnetic field axis (+Y).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <γ * S_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`.\nThe expectation value of `S_z` at time `t` is:\n`<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this in a few ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Direct Calculation)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian.**\n    The new Hamiltonian is proportional to `S_y`. The Pauli matrix for `S_y` is `S_y = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    The initial state `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y` (`|+y>` and `|-y>`).\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * |+y> - (i/√2) * |-y>`\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    The eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>` have energies `E_+ = -γB(hbar/2)` and `E_- = +γB(hbar/2)` under `H_new`.\n    The time evolution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/hbar) * |+y> - (i/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/hbar) * |-y>`\n    Let `ω = γB`. Then `E_+ = -ω*hbar/2` and `E_- = +ω*hbar/2`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2) * |+y> - (i/√2) * exp(-iωt/2) * |-y>`\n\n3.  **Convert back to the Z-basis and calculate `<S_z>`**.\n    After substituting the Z-basis representations of `|+y>` and `|-y>` and simplifying (using Euler's formulas), we find the state vector at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n\n4.  Now, calculate the expectation value:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z>(t) = (hbar/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (hbar/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (hbar/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The oscillation is described by the `cos(ωt)` term. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    Since we defined `ω = γB`, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture\n\nThe Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator `A` is `dA/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [A, H]`.\nFor `A = S_z` and `H = -γBS_y`:\n`dS_z/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [S_z, -γBS_y] = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * [S_z, S_y]`\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_z, S_y] = -i*hbar*S_x`:\n`dS_z/dt = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * (-i*hbar*S_x) = +γB*S_x`\n\nSimilarly, for `A = S_x`:\n`dS_x/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [S_x, -γBS_y] = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * [S_x, S_y]`\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = i*hbar*S_z`:\n`dS_x/dt = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * (i*hbar*S_z) = -γB*S_z`\n\nWe have a system of coupled differential equations:\n1.  `dS_z/dt = γB * S_x`\n2.  `dS_x/dt = -γB * S_z`\n\nDifferentiating the first equation and substituting the second gives:\n`d²S_z/dt² = γB * (dS_x/dt) = γB * (-γB * S_z) = -(γB)² * S_z`\n`d²S_z/dt² + (γB)² * S_z = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Energy Splitting\n\nThe initial state `|+z>` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates (`|+y>` and `|-y>`) of the new Hamiltonian. The energies are `E_+ = -γB(hbar/2)` and `E_- = +γB(hbar/2)`.\nThe interference between these two energy components in the superposition causes observables (that are not diagonal in the energy basis) to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is given by the energy difference:\n`ω = ΔE / hbar = (E_- - E_+) / hbar`\n`ω = ( (γB*hbar/2) - (-γB*hbar/2) ) / hbar`\n`ω = (γB*hbar) / hbar = γB`\n\nAll three methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics that describes the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ_vec = γS_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field `B_vec` is in the +Z direction: `B_vec = B k̂`.\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ_vec ⋅ B_vec = -γ(S_vec ⋅ B k̂) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z⟩` (with energy `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (with energy `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`).\n*   The lowest energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, so the new field is `B'_vec = B ĵ`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H'` that governs the time evolution for `t ≥ 0` is `H' = -μ_vec ⋅ B'_vec = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian `H'`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix. The evolution operator becomes:\n    `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n*   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix, we can expand the operator with `θ = γBt/2`:\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y)|+z⟩`\n*   Since `I|+z⟩ = |+z⟩` and `σ_y|+z⟩ = i|-z⟩`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + isin(γBt/2)(i|-z⟩) = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we need to calculate `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|γS_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Let's evaluate the expectation value:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ (⟨cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|⟩) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩)`\n*   We use the properties `S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩`, and the orthogonality of the states (`⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1`, `⟨-z|-z⟩ = 1`, `⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0`). The cross-terms vanish, leaving:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ [cos²(γBt/2)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ + sin²(γBt/2)⟨-z|S_z|-z⟩]`\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ [cos²(γBt/2)(ħ/2) + sin²(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)]`\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expression for the expectation value `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time. The general form for an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   The coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Hamiltonian\n\n*   **Initial Situation (t < 0):** A spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`, where `μ = γS` is the magnetic moment and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the spin-up `|+z⟩` and spin-down `|-z⟩` states. The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_down = +γ(ħ/2)B`. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   **New Situation (t ≥ 0):** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_y B`.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Solving the Time Evolution\n\nTo find `|ψ(t)⟩`, it is most convenient to express the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to the spin operator `S_y`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we denote as `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates of S_y:**\n    *   `|+y⟩` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n    *   `|-y⟩` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`.\n*   **Energy Eigenstates of H:**\n    *   For `|+y⟩`, the energy is `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   For `|-y⟩`, the energy is `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n\nNext, we express the initial state `|+z⟩` in terms of `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. The standard relations are:\n`|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n`|-z⟩ = (-i/√2) (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)`\n\nSo, the initial state is:\n`|ψ(0)⟩ = (1/√2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) |-y⟩`\n\nNow, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are energy eigenstates, the evolution is simple:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-iE_+t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-iE_-t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) e^(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) e^(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ) |-y⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`. We need to calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nTo do this, we need to know how `S_z` acts on the `y`-basis states:\n`S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |-y⟩`\n`S_z |-y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩`\n\nNow we can compute the expectation value:\n`S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n`= (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) S_z|+y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) S_z|-y⟩ ]`\n`= (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) (ħ/2)|-y⟩ + e^(-iγBt/2) (ħ/2)|+y⟩ ]`\n`= (ħ/(2√2)) [ e^(-iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nNow, we take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)|`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\n`⟨ψ(t)| = (1/√2) [ e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ]`\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iγBt/2) ⟨+y| + e^(iγBt/2) ⟨-y| ] ⋅ (ħ/(2√2)) [ e^(-iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + e^(iγBt/2) |-y⟩ ]`\n\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis (`⟨+y|+y⟩ = 1`, `⟨-y|-y⟩ = 1`, `⟨+y|-y⟩ = 0`), we get:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(-iγBt/2)e^(-iγBt/2) + e^(iγBt/2)e^(iγBt/2) ]`\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ e^(-iγBt) + e^(iγBt) ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formula, `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`, we find:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/4) [ 2 cos(γBt) ] = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThis is a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. By comparing this to our result, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency, which describes the precession of the spin expectation vector around the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment `μ` (which is proportional to its spin `S`, `μ = γS`) is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Change of Field**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The magnetic moment, which was pointing in the Z direction, now finds itself in a magnetic field pointing along the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Precession**: The magnetic field `B` exerts a torque on the magnetic moment `μ`, causing the magnetic moment vector to rotate, or precess, around the new field direction (+Y axis).\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-component**: As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. Since the initial moment was entirely along the Z-axis, it starts at its maximum value and then decreases, passes through zero, reaches a minimum (pointing in the -Z direction), and then returns to its initial state. This periodic change is an oscillation.\n\n5.  **Frequency Calculation**: The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω`, and is given by the formula:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle, a constant that relates its magnetic moment to its angular momentum.\n    *   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`, will oscillate according to the equation:\n`<μz(t)> = <μz(0)> * cos(ωt) = <μz(0)> * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` in the cosine function, which is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis physical situation describes the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new field direction.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`, will oscillate as the spin precesses. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):** The particle is aligned with the Z-axis, so its state is the \"spin up\" eigenstate of the Sz operator, denoted as `|+z>`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):** The magnetic field is now `B` in the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian `H` which governs the evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B = -γ(S · B) = -γB*Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Calculation:** By carrying out the quantum mechanical calculation, it can be shown that `<Sz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`.\n6.  **Frequency:** The term `cos(γBt)` describes an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin. Therefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates at the Larmor frequency.\n\nGiven the options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, Sz.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment is no longer aligned with the field. The magnetic field exerts a torque on the magnetic moment, causing it to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic moment (μ), the spin angular momentum (S), and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is given by μ = γS. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field B is H = -μ ⋅ B.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` is given by the torque equation `d<S>/dt = γ(<S> × B)`. This equation shows that the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial state has the spin aligned along the Z-axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` is applied along the Y-axis.\n*   The spin vector, and thus the magnetic moment, will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment will oscillate as its projection onto the Z-axis changes over time.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nThe particle is spin 1/2 and is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\nGiven $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\nThe z-component of spin is $S_z$. For a spin 1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ and $-\\hbar/2$, corresponding to the eigenstates $|+z\\rangle$ (spin up) and $|-z\\rangle$ (spin down).\n\nThe initial Hamiltonian is $H_i = -\\gamma S_z B$. The energy eigenvalues are $E = -\\gamma B m_s \\hbar$, where $m_s = \\pm 1/2$.\n*   For spin up ($|+z\\rangle$), $E_{\\uparrow} = -\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n*   For spin down ($|-z\\rangle$), $E_{\\downarrow} = +\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n\nAssuming $\\gamma B > 0$, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time $t=0$ is:\n$|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+z\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\nAt $t=0$, the magnetic field is switched to $\\vec{B}' = B\\hat{j}$ (pointing in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian for $t>0$ is:\n$H_f = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}' = -\\gamma (\\vec{S} \\cdot B\\hat{j}) = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian:\n$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iH_f t / \\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t / \\hbar} |+z\\rangle = e^{i \\gamma B t S_y / \\hbar} |+z\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nWe need to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n$\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$.\n\nWe can solve this using two common methods.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Ehrenfest's Theorem)\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin operator is given by:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[\\vec{S}, H_f]\\rangle$\n\nSubstituting $H_f = -\\gamma B S_y$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_z, -\\gamma B S_y]\\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_z, S_y]\\rangle$\n\nUsing the spin commutation relation $[S_z, S_y] = -i\\hbar S_x$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}(-i\\hbar \\langle S_x \\rangle) = \\gamma B \\langle S_x \\rangle$  (Eq. 1)\n\nSimilarly, for $\\langle S_x \\rangle$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_x, -\\gamma B S_y]\\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}\\langle[S_x, S_y]\\rangle$\n\nUsing the commutation relation $[S_x, S_y] = i\\hbar S_z$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle = \\frac{-\\gamma B}{i\\hbar}(i\\hbar \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle$ (Eq. 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations. We can solve them by differentiating Eq. 1 with respect to time:\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle S_x \\rangle$\n\nSubstitute Eq. 2 into this:\n$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B (-\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -(\\gamma B)^2 \\langle S_z \\rangle$\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n$\\omega = \\gamma B$\n\n#### Method 2: Energy Eigenstate Decomposition\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the expectation value of an observable in a two-level system is given by the energy difference between the levels, $\\omega = \\Delta E / \\hbar$.\n\n1.  Find the eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian $H_f = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$.\n2.  The energy eigenvalues are therefore:\n    *   $E_1 = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n    *   $E_2 = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n3.  The energy difference between these two states is:\n    $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}\\right) = \\gamma B \\hbar$.\n4.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition:\n    $\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B$.\n\nThis method works because the initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is a superposition of the energy eigenstates of $H_f$ (which are the eigenstates of $S_y$), and the observable $S_z$ has non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements in the $S_y$ basis. Both conditions are met.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The average z-component of the particle's moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$, oscillates with an angular frequency of $\\omega = \\gamma B$. This is the well-known Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe problem describes a classic quantum mechanical phenomenon known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle has a spin of 1/2, and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up state with respect to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian and Time Evolution**: The interaction between a magnetic moment `μ` and a magnetic field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Given that the magnetic moment is `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator), the new Hamiltonian, after the field is switched to the +Y direction, becomes `H = -γB * Sy`. The state of the particle will then evolve over time according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession**: When the magnetic field is suddenly changed, the spin of the particle does not instantly realign. Instead, the expectation value of the spin vector begins to precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). The z-component of the magnetic moment is proportional to the z-component of the spin, `μz = γSz`. We are interested in the average, or expectation value, of this component, which is `<μz(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Oscillation**: The calculation of the expectation value `<μz(t)>` shows that it oscillates. The expectation value of the spin's z-component, `<Sz(t)>`, will vary as `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n\n5.  **The Oscillation Frequency**: This angular frequency of precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ωL`. The formula for the Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio and the magnitude of the magnetic field. The frequency `ω` is given by the equation:\n\n    `ω = γB`\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem using quantum mechanics principles, which will be implemented in the Python code:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:** The particle is initially in a magnetic field along the +Z direction and its spin is aligned with it. This means the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `|+z⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|-z⟩ = [0, 1]`, the initial state vector `ψ(0)` is `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:** When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the system's evolution is given by `H = -μ · B = -γ(S · B)`. Since the new field is `B` in the +Y direction, `H = -γB * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system at a later time `t`, `ψ(t)`, is found by applying the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` to the initial state `ψ(0)`.\n    *   `ψ(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) ψ(0)`\n    *   Substituting `H = -γB * Sy`, this becomes `ψ(t) = exp(iγB*t*Sy/ħ) ψ(0)`.\n    *   The spin operator `Sy` can be expressed using the Pauli matrix `σ_y` as `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    *   This simplifies the operator to `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩`. This is equal to `γ⟨Sz⟩`. The expectation value of `Sz` at time `t` is calculated as `⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:** The resulting expression for `⟨μz⟩(t)` will be a function that oscillates with time, typically in the form of `cos(ωt)` or `sin(ωt)`. The angular frequency `ω` is the oscillation frequency we are looking for.\n\nThe Python code below will use the `sympy` library to perform these matrix and symbolic calculations to find the expression for `⟨μz⟩(t)` and identify its oscillation frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import I, Matrix, cos, sin, Symbol, exp, pi\n\ndef solve_spin_oscillation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's\n    magnetic moment in a magnetic field.\n\n    The problem involves a spin initially aligned in the +Z direction, which is then\n    subjected to a magnetic field in the +Y direction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

Define the Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`. The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ_vec . B_vec = -γ(S_vec) . (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`.\n    *   `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n**2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)**\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B'_vec = B * y_hat` is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ_vec . B'_vec = -γ(S_vec) . (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Time Evolution of the State**\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`. We want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, where `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. A very effective method for this is to use the Heisenberg picture or Ehrenfest's theorem.\n\n**Method: Using the Equations of Motion for Expectation Values (Ehrenfest's Theorem)**\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by:\n`d/dt ⟨A⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩`\n\nLet's apply this to `⟨S_z⟩` and `⟨S_x⟩`:\n*   **For `⟨S_z⟩`:**\n    `d/dt ⟨S_z⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, -γB * S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_z, S_y]⟩`\n    Using the spin commutator relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    `d/dt ⟨S_z⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨-iħS_x⟩ = γB⟨S_x⟩`  --- (Equation 1)\n\n*   **For `⟨S_x⟩`:**\n    `d/dt ⟨S_x⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, -γB * S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_x, S_y]⟩`\n    Using the spin commutator relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`.\n    `d/dt ⟨S_x⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨iħS_z⟩ = -γB⟨S_z⟩` --- (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Solve the Coupled Differential Equations**\n\nWe now have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n`d²/dt² ⟨S_z⟩ = γB * (d/dt ⟨S_x⟩)`\n\nNow, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n`d²/dt² ⟨S_z⟩ = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n\nRearranging this gives the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n`d²/dt² ⟨S_z⟩ + (γB)²⟨S_z⟩ = 0`\n\nThe general solution is `⟨S_z⟩(t) = A*cos(ωt) + C*sin(ωt)`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n**5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe expectation value of `S_z` oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. The question asks for the oscillation frequency. Given the options, it is clear that it refers to this angular frequency.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The initial state must be correctly identified as the lowest energy state, `|+z⟩`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y` correctly describes the system for `t > 0`.\n    *   The spin commutation relations (`[S_i, S_j] = iħε_ijk S_k`) are crucial for the calculation.\n    *   The final equation of motion for `⟨S_z⟩` is that of a simple harmonic oscillator, from which the frequency can be directly identified.

The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_vec = -γS ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.

Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H = -γB * S_y`, the operator acts on them simply by multiplying by a phase factor `e^(-iEt/ħ)`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>` are:\n        `E_y+ = -γB(+ħ/2)`\n        `E_y- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   So, the time evolution of the state is:\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (e^(-iE_y+ t/ħ) |+y> + e^(-iE_y- t/ħ) |-y>)`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (e^(iγBt/2) |+y> + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y>)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment**\n    *   The goal is to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To do this, we can express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis.\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   Substituting these into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n    *   Using Euler's identities (`cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate the expectation value of `S_z`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * S_z * [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\n        Since `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = cos²(γBt/2) * (ħ/2) - sin²(γBt/2) * (ħ/2)`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation with a time-dependent term `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n*Alternative (Quicker) Method:*\nThe system is a two-level system governed by the Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y`.

The energy difference between the two levels is `ΔE = E_y- - E_y+ = γBħ`.\nFor a two-level system, when the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates (which `|+z>` is), the expectation values of observables that are not diagonal in the energy basis (like `S_z`) will oscillate at an angular frequency given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis is a classic quantum mechanics problem describing the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle. The average, or expectation value, of the spin components perpendicular to an applied magnetic field will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian (the energy operator) of the system is given by `H = -μ · B = -γ * B * S_y`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `B` is the magnetic field, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, can be shown to evolve according to the equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² * <S_z>`\n\n4.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for `<S_z>(t)` is a sinusoidal oscillation. The angular frequency `ω` of this oscillation is the term inside the square, which is `ω = γB`. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`, is directly proportional to `<S_z>` (since `μ_z = γS_z`), so it oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nThis precession of the spin's expectation value around the magnetic field is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin expectation value points along +Z. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment, and thus the spin, begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y).\n\nAs the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nHere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThis result can be derived formally using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but it is a standard result in quantum mechanics and magnetic resonance. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate as cos(γBt), meaning the frequency of oscillation is indeed γB. This frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, S_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the spin begins to precess around the new axis of the magnetic field.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the system in the presence of a magnetic field **B** is given by H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **μ** is the magnetic moment. Since **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ**S** ⋅ **B**.\n\nWith the new magnetic field **B** = B**ŷ**, the Hamiltonian is H = -γB S_y. The time evolution of the expectation value of any operator that does not explicitly depend on time is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion. For the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z⟩, its expectation value will oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by ω = γB (in angular frequency units). The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z(t)⟩, and consequently the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, will oscillate with this frequency.\n\nThe detailed calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin is ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). The argument of the cosine function is ωt, which means the angular frequency of oscillation is ω = γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2. Its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the vector equation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem statement `μ = γSz` is a common shorthand for the z-component `μz = γSz`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. This means the spin is also aligned with the +Z direction, which minimizes the interaction energy `E = -μ · B`.\n    *   The state of a spin-1/2 particle aligned with the +Z axis is the \"spin-up\" eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, which we denote as `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is given by the interaction energy with the new field:\n        `H = -μ · B = -γS · (B ĵ) = -γB Sy`\n        where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-direction and `ĵ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession Method):**\n    *   A classical magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ × B`, which causes it to precess around the magnetic field direction.\n    *   The quantum mechanical analogue, described by the Ehrenfest theorem, is that the *expectation value* of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field `B`.\n    *   The equation of motion is `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> × B)`.\n    *   This equation describes precession around the vector `B` with an angular frequency `Ω`, known as the Larmor frequency, given by:\n        `Ω = γB`\n    *   In our problem, the initial spin expectation value is `<S(0)>`, which points in the +Z direction (since the state is `|+z>`, `<Sx(0)>=0`, `<Sy(0)>=0`, `<Sz(0)> = +ħ/2`).\n    *   The new magnetic field `B` points in the +Y direction.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `<S(t)>` will precess around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane, starting from the Z-axis.\n    *   The z-component of a vector precessing in the XZ-plane with angular frequency `Ω` is described by a cosine function:\n        `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(Ωt) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is an oscillation described by `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Quantum State Evolution Method):**\n    *   We need to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. A standard way is to express the initial state in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB Sy`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a superposition of these new eigenstates:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   The time evolution of the state `|ψ(t)>` is given by applying the time evolution operator `exp(-iHt/ħ)`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iE_+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_- t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n        where `E_+` and `E_-` are the energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of Sy)`, so `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Substituting these into the state evolution equation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(i γB t / 2) |+y> + exp(-i γB t / 2) |-y> ]`\n    *   To find the expectation value of `Sz`, we can transform this state back to the z-basis. Doing so (the detailed algebra is shown in the thought process) yields:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<Sz>(t)`:\n        `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n        `<Sz>(t) = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        Using `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [ cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2) ]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   Again, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the semi-classical Larmor precession argument and the full quantum mechanical calculation show that the average of the z-component of the moment, `<μz>(t)>`, oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\n    The calculated frequency is `γB`, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin can be either \"up\" or \"down\" along a given axis. \"Aligned\" means the spin is in the higher energy state that corresponds to the magnetic moment pointing along the field. However, the potential energy is `U = -μ ⋅ B`. To be aligned, `μ` and `B` should be parallel, which minimizes the energy. If `γ > 0`, `μ_z` and `S_z` have the same sign. So `μ` is parallel to `B` when `S_z` is positive. Therefore, the particle is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    In quantum mechanics, this state is represented by the eigenvector of the `S_z` operator with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. Let's denote this state as `|+z>`. So, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new magnetic field is `B_vec = B j_hat` (where `j_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    The interaction of a magnetic moment `μ` with a magnetic field `B_vec` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec`.\n    The magnetic moment operator `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    So, `μ = γ(S_x i_hat + S_y j_hat + S_z k_hat)`.\n    The Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is:\n    `H = - (γS) ⋅ (B j_hat) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)`.\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The expression simplifies to:\n    `U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`.\n    We need to calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    Let's find the state `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n    To evaluate this, we can express the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y`. The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    In the z-basis:\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    From these, we can write the initial state `|+z>` as:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n    Now, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y`, the action of `U(t)` is simple:\n    `U(t)|+y> = exp(iωt(+ħ/2)/ħ) |+y> = exp(iωt/2) |+y>`\n    `U(t)|-y> = exp(iωt(-ħ/2)/ħ) |-y> = exp(-iωt/2) |-y>`\n\n    So, the state at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) * (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ U(t)|+y> + U(t)|-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iωt/2)|+y> + exp(-iωt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n    Now, we convert back to the z-basis to calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (exp(iωt/2) + exp(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iωt/2) - exp(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we can calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Using `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, and the orthogonality of the states:\n    `<S_z(t)> = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n    The expression for `<μ_z(t)>` is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(Ωt)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n    In our case, the argument of the cosine is `ωt`. Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\n    We defined `ω = γB`.\n\n    So, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field direction (`Y`-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (at t=0):**\n    *   The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment (**μ** = γ**S**) is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction (**B₀** = B **k̂**). This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate where its spin points along the +Z axis.\n    *   In the standard |↑>, |↓> basis (also known as the S_z basis), this state is the \"spin-up\" state.\n    *   So, the initial state vector at t=0 is |ψ(0)> = |+z>.\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian for Time Evolution (for t > 0):**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction: **B** = B **ĵ**.\n    *   The interaction energy between the magnetic moment and this new field is given by the Hamiltonian, H:\n        H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**\n    *   Substituting the expressions for **μ** and **B**:\n        H = -(γ**S**) ⋅ (B**ĵ**) = -γB S_y\n    *   This Hamiltonian is constant for t > 0 and will govern the evolution of the system.\n\n3.  **Analyze the System's Dynamics (Heisenberg Picture):**\n    *   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ_z(t)>. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is proportional to the expectation value of the S_z operator, <S_z(t)>. We need to find how <S_z(t)> oscillates.\n    *   The Heisenberg picture provides a direct way to see how the operators evolve in time. The Heisenberg equation of motion for any operator A is:\n        d**A**/dt = (i/ħ) [H, **A**]\n    *   Let's apply this to the S_z operator:\n        d(S_z)/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_z] = (i/ħ) [-γB S_y, S_z]\n        d(S_z)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) [S_y, S_z]\n    *   Using the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators, [S_y, S_z] = iħS_x, we get:\n        d(S_z)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) (iħS_x) = γB S_x  (Eq. 1)\n    *   This equation shows that the rate of change of S_z is coupled to S_x. To solve this, we must also find the time evolution of S_x:\n        d(S_x)/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_x] = (-iγB/ħ) [S_y, S_x]\n    *   Using the commutation relation [S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z:\n        d(S_x)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) (-iħS_z) = -γB S_z  (Eq. 2)\n\n4.  **Derive the Equation of Oscillation:**\n    *   We now have a system of two coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the operators, <S_z(t)> and <S_x(t)>:\n        1.  d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>\n        2.  d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>\n    *   To find an equation solely for <S_z>, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)\n    *   Now, substitute the second equation into this result:\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>)\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The derived equation, d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>, is the standard mathematical equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: d²x/dt² = -ω²x.\n    *   By direct comparison, the angular frequency (ω) of the oscillation of <S_z> is:\n        ω = γB\n    *   Since <μ_z(t)> is directly proportional to <S_z(t)>, it oscillates with the same frequency. This frequency, γB, is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\nInitially, the magnetic field is $\\vec{B}_0 = B\\hat{z}$. The Hamiltonian is $H_0 = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_0 = -\\gamma S_z B$. The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy state. The energies for spin-up ($|+\\rangle_z$, eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$) and spin-down ($|-\\rangle_z$, eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$) are $E_+ = -\\gamma B \\hbar/2$ and $E_- = +\\gamma B \\hbar/2$. The lowest energy state is the spin-up state.\nThus, the initial state of the particle at $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle_z$.\n\n**2. New Hamiltonian:**\nAt $t=0$, the field is switched to $\\vec{B'} = B\\hat{y}$. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for $t>0$ is $H' = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B'} = -\\gamma S_y B$.\n\n**3. Time Evolution and Oscillation Frequency:**\nThe state of the particle will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian $H'$. The initial state $|+\\rangle_z$ is not an eigenstate of $H'$ (since $S_z$ and $S_y$ do not commute). Therefore, the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of $H'$.\n\nThe eigenstates of $H' = -\\gamma B S_y$ are the eigenstates of the $S_y$ operator, which we denote as $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$. Their corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n*   $E'_+ = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}$ (for state $|+\\rangle_y$)\n*   $E'_- = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}$ (for state $|-\\rangle_y$)\n\nWhen a quantum system is in a superposition of two energy eigenstates with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, the expectation value of any observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate with an angular frequency given by the Bohr frequency rule:\n$\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar}$\n\nIn this case, the energy difference is $\\Delta E = E'_- - E'_+ = (\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}) - (-\\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{2}) = \\gamma\\hbar B$.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is therefore:\n$\\omega = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar B}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B$\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation value of the spin vector, $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$, precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis) at this frequency. Consequently, its projection onto the z-axis, $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, will oscillate sinusoidally with this angular frequency. The same applies to the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n**Detailed Calculation (as performed in the reasoning steps):**\nA full calculation of the expectation value $\\langle\\mu_z(t)\\rangle$ confirms this result:\n$\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$\nFrom this expression, it is clear that the angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is $\\gamma B$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in the \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change**: The Z-direction field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude, B, is turned on along the +Y direction. The spin of the particle does not change instantaneously.\n\n3.  **Precession**: The magnetic moment (and thus the spin) begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This precession occurs at the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Larmor Frequency**: The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ · B`. For a spin, where `μ = γS` (`γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`. The equation of motion for the spin shows that it precesses around the magnetic field with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of the Z-component**: As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change. If the spin vector starts along the Z-axis, it will rotate in the X-Z plane (as it precesses around Y). The value of the z-component will trace out a cosine function over time. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the precession frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a spin-up eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The new Hamiltonian is given by H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB*S*y, where **μ** is the magnetic moment operator, **B** is the magnetic field, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and *S*y is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\nThe spin vector, which is initially pointing along the Z-axis, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The expectation value of the spin's components will evolve in time according to the Ehrenfest theorem or by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector <**S**> is d<**S**>/dt = γ(<**S**> × **B**). Since **B** is in the Y direction, this leads to the following set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components:\n\n*   d<*S*x>/dt = γB<*S*z>\n*   d<*S*y>/dt = 0\n*   d<*S*z>/dt = -γB<*S*x>\n\nDifferentiating the equation for <*S*z> with respect to time gives:\nd²<*S*z>/dt² = -γB(d<*S*x>/dt) = -γB(γB<*S*z>) = -(γB)²<*S*z>\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency ω = γB. Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and consequently the z-component of the magnetic moment, oscillates with an angular frequency of γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe initial condition is that the spin is aligned along +Z, so at t=0, <*S*z> has its maximum value of ħ/2, and <*S*x> is zero. The solution for the z-component is <*S*z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine function.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment (in this case, arising from the particle's spin) is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in the \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis. When this field is switched off and a new field of the same magnitude, B, is applied in the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y).\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and thus the z-component of the magnetic moment, will oscillate as the spin vector precesses. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nHere, ω is the angular frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this. The initial state is the eigenstate of the spin operator S_z. The time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian, H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y. By solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is found to be:\n\n⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)\n\nFrom this expression, the angular frequency of oscillation is clearly ω = γB. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis is a classic problem of magnetic resonance and Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle has a spin magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the z-component of spin is $S_z$.\n    *   The magnetic field is $\\vec{B}_{init} = B \\hat{k}$ (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma S_z B$.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means its magnetic moment is parallel to the field, which corresponds to the lowest energy state (ground state). For the energy $E = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$ to be minimal, $\\vec{\\mu}$ must be parallel to $\\vec{B}$. Since $\\vec{\\mu}$ is proportional to $\\vec{S}$, the spin must also be pointing in the +Z direction.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at $t=0$ is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, which we denote as $|+\\rangle_z$ or $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. In vector notation, this is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   For this state, the expectation value of the z-component of spin is $\\langle S_z \\rangle = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B \\hat{j}$ (in the +Y direction). The magnitude $B$ remains the same.\n    *   For all $t \\ge 0$, the new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is $H_{new} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma S_y B$.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):**\n    The time evolution of the state vector $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i H_{new} t / \\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$\n    Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i (-\\gamma B S_y) t / \\hbar} |+\\rangle_z = e^{i (\\gamma B t) S_y / \\hbar} |+\\rangle_z$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n    We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| \\mu_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n\n    This can be solved in a few ways.\n\n    **Method 1: The Precession Analogy (Intuitive approach)**\n    The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n    $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma (\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B})$\n    This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the direction of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.\n    *   Initially, at $t=0$, the spin is aligned with the old Z-axis: $\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle = (\\hbar/2)\\hat{k}$.\n    *   For $t>0$, the field is along the Y-axis: $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{j}$.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane with an angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n    *   The z-component of this precessing vector, $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$, will oscillate. The vector starts at its maximum z-value, so its time dependence will be a cosine function.\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle S_z(0) \\rangle \\cos(\\omega t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The average magnetic moment is then $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   From this expression, we can see that the oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n    **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    We need to evaluate $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{i (\\gamma B t) S_y / \\hbar} |+\\rangle_z$.\n    We use the matrix representation in the z-basis:\n    $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $|+\\rangle_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{i (\\gamma B t) (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y) / \\hbar} = e^{i (\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}) \\sigma_y}$.\n    Let $\\alpha = \\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}$. The operator becomes $e^{i\\alpha\\sigma_y}$. Using the identity $e^{i\\alpha\\sigma_y} = \\cos(\\alpha)I + i\\sin(\\alpha)\\sigma_y$:\n    $U(t) = \\cos(\\alpha) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + i\\sin(\\alpha) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) & \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\ -\\sin(\\alpha) & \\cos(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Now apply this operator to the initial state:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) & \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\ -\\sin(\\alpha) & \\cos(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\ -\\sin(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Now, we calculate the expectation value of $S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) & -\\sin(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\ -\\sin(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\cos^2(\\alpha) - \\sin^2(\\alpha)) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(2\\alpha)$.\n    Substitute back $\\alpha = \\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}$:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    The expectation value of the magnetic moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    The expression clearly shows an oscillation of the form $\\cos(\\omega t)$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction (S_z). When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new axis. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. The particle is aligned with a magnetic field **B** = B**ẑ**, meaning its spin is in the spin-up state along the z-axis. In the S_z basis, this state |ψ(0)> is represented as:\n    |ψ(0)> = |+z> = (1, 0)\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B** = B**ŷ**. The new Hamiltonian governing the system is:\n    H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ(**S** ⋅ **B**) = -γB S_y\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a later time t, |ψ(t)>, is given by:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ_z>(t), which is γ<S_z>(t).\n    <S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>\n    Substituting the expression for |ψ(t)>:\n    <S_z>(t) = <ψ(0)| e^(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The calculation shows that the expectation value of the spin's z-component oscillates over time:\n    <S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    <μ_z>(t) = γ <S_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The equation for <μ_z>(t) is a cosine function. The term inside the cosine, ωt, gives the angular frequency of oscillation. In this case, the argument is (γB)t.\n\nTherefore, the angular oscillation frequency is ω = γB. This is a well-known result called the Larmor frequency. The phenomenon itself, the rotation of the spin's expectation value around the magnetic field direction, is called Larmor precession.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThis problem describes the quantum mechanical phenomenon of Larmor precession. A spin's magnetic moment, when placed in a magnetic field, will precess around the direction of the field at a specific frequency, known as the Larmor frequency. We can solve this by calculating the time evolution of the quantum state and then finding the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Set up the quantum system:** Define the initial state of the spin-1/2 particle. Since it's aligned with a field in the +Z direction, its initial state `|ψ(0)>` is spin-up along Z, denoted as `|+z>`.\n2.  **Define the dynamics:** When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ · B = -γB*S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. We will use Python with the SymPy library to carry out this matrix exponentiation.\n4.  **Find the expectation value:** We will calculate the average (or expectation) value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Identify the frequency:** The resulting expectation value will be an oscillating function of time, proportional to `cos(Ωt)`. The angular frequency `Ω` is the value we are looking for. We will extract this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_spin_oscillation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's \n    magnetic moment using quantum mechanics and symbolic computation with SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the physical quantities and operators using SymPy.\n    # We can set hbar=1, as it will cancel out in the final frequency calculation,\n    # but we will keep it for rigor.\n    gamma, B, t, hbar = sp.symbols('gamma B t hbar', real=True, positive=True)\n    i = sp.I\n\n    # The spin operators in the S_z basis (where |+z> is [1,0]^T).\n    S_y = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[0, -i], [i, 0]])\n    S_z = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # Step 2: Define the initial state of the system, |+z>.\n    psi_initial = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n    # Step 3: Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0, with the magnetic field along +Y.\n    H_y = -gamma * B * S_y\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the time evolution of the state vector using the evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar).\n    # We use the identity exp(i*a*PauliMatrix) = cos(a)*I + i*sin(a)*PauliMatrix\n    # The argument to the exponential is (-i*H_y*t/hbar) = (i*gamma*B*t/hbar)*S_y\n    # This simplifies to i*(gamma*B*t/2)*sigma_y.

Its state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n2.  **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin angular momentum `S`, with the relation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μz = γSz`.\n3.  **Initial Condition:** The particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. In quantum mechanics, \"aligned\" usually implies the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n4.  **Energy:** The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `E = -μ · B`. Initially, this is `E = -μz * B = -γ * Sz * B`.\n5.  **Lowest Energy State:** To minimize energy `E`, the value of `Sz` must be maximized. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the `Sz` operator are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The maximum value is `+ħ/2`.\n6.  **Initial State Vector:** Therefore, at `t=0`, the particle is in the \"spin up\" eigenstate of `Sz`. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard Z-basis, this state is represented by the vector `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Dynamics for t > 0\n\n1.  **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched from the Z-direction to the Y-direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the evolution of the system for `t > 0` is based on the new field.\n    `H = -μ · B = -μy * B`\n    Since `μy = γSy`, the new Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`.\n3.  **Sy Operator:** The spin operator `Sy` for a spin-1/2 particle in the Z-basis is:\n    `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n4.  **Hamiltonian Matrix:** Substituting `Sy` into the Hamiltonian expression:\n    `H = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n### Step 3: Evolve the State in Time\n\n1.  **Schrödinger Equation:** The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian (which we have for `t>0`), the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n2.  **Time Evolution Operator:** Let's calculate the operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)`.\n    `-iHt/ħ = -i * (-γB(ħ/2)σy) * t / ħ = i * (γBt/2) * σy`\n    So, `U(t) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy)`.\n3.  **Pauli Matrix Property:** We can use the useful identity `exp(iθn·σ) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)n·σ`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `n·σ` is a Pauli matrix.\n    Here, `θ = γBt/2` and `n·σ = σy`.\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * I + i * sin(γBt/2) * σy`\n    In matrix form:\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n4.  **Calculate |ψ(t)>:** Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    This can be written as `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Expectation Value and Find the Frequency\n\n1.  **Observable:** We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`. Since `μz = γSz`, this is `γ<Sz(t)>`. We first find `<Sz(t)>`.\n2.  **Expectation Value Calculation:** `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    *   The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   `<Sz(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n3.  **Trigonometric Identity:** Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n4.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<Sz(t)>`, oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`. The expectation value of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, therefore oscillates with the same frequency. This phenomenon is known as Larmor Precession, and `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This phrasing is key to establishing the initial state as the lowest energy eigenstate, `|+z>`.\n*   **Hamiltonian Sign**: The energy is `E = -μ·B`, so the Hamiltonian has a negative sign, `H = -γB Sy`. A mistake here would alter the time evolution.\n*   **Sudden Approximation**: The change in the magnetic field is \"sudden,\" which means the state of the system does not change during the switch. `|ψ(t=0+)> = |ψ(t=0-)>`.\n*   **Angular Frequency**: The question asks for \"frequency.\" The options provided (`γB`, etc.) have units of radians/second, which is angular frequency (`ω`), not ordinary frequency (`f = ω/2π`).\n*   **Heisenberg Picture (Alternative):** One could also solve this using the Heisenberg picture, where operators evolve in time. The equations of motion `d<S>/dt = <[S,H]>/iħ` lead to a set of coupled differential equations for `<Sx>`, `<Sy>`, and `<Sz>`, which shows that `<Sz>` oscillates with frequency `γB`. This provides a good consistency check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the expectation value `<μz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a two-component spinor. The basis states are typically chosen as the eigenstates of the `S_z` operator, the spin projection along the z-axis.\n*   `|+z>` (spin-up): `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>`\n*   `|-z>` (spin-down): `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>`\n\nThe problem states that initially, the particle's magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. The energy is minimized when `S_z` is maximized, meaning the particle is in the spin-up state.\nTherefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is:\n`|ψ(0)> = |+z>`\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian for t > 0\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is:\n`H = -μ · B_new = -γ (S · (B j_hat)) = -γB S_y`\nwhere `S_y` is the operator for the y-component of the spin.\n\n### 3. Determine the Time Evolution of the State\nThe state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\nTo calculate this, it is easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `S_y`, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of `S_y`.\nThe eigenvectors of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively. The corresponding eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y` are:\n*   `E_+y = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` (for state `|+y>`)\n*   `E_-y = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` (for state `|-y>`)\n\nNext, we express the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` in terms of the `S_y` eigenvectors. The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis eigenvectors is:\n`|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\nNow we can apply the time evolution operator:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y> ]`\n\nSince `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates, the operation is simple:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-iE_+y t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-y t/ħ)|-y> ]`\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`. Let's first calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nTo do this easily, we can convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `z`-basis. Using `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`, we substitute them into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ exp(iγBt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iγBt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formulas, `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/(2i)`, this simplifies to:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\nNow we can calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n`<S_z(t)> = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nApplying `S_z` to the ket:\n`S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>] = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nNow, taking the inner product:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] [cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nDue to the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(2 * (γBt/2))`\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is then:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for the average z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\nIn our result, `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2) cos(γBt)`, the argument of the cosine function is `γBt`.\nTherefore, the angular frequency of oscillation `Ω` is:\n`Ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The magnetic moment vector precesses about the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `Ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Oscillation Frequency Determined by Larmor Precession\n\nWhen a spin-1/2 particle, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, is suddenly subjected to a magnetic field of the same magnitude (B) in the +Y direction, the z-component of its magnetic moment will oscillate. This oscillation is a direct consequence of a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) and the magnetic field strength (B).\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is **γB**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with the Z-axis, meaning it is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-direction.\n2.  **New Dynamics**: When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-axis, the particle's magnetic moment experiences a torque. This torque causes the spin vector not to align with the new field, but to precess (or wobble) around it. This is analogous to a spinning top precessing in a gravitational field.\n3.  **Hamiltonian and Time Evolution**: The system's evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H = -μ · B = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the spin operator for the y-component. Solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation shows that the initial \"spin-up\" state evolves into a superposition of \"spin-up\" and \"spin-down\" states.\n4.  **Expectation Value**: The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the magnetic moment (<μz>) is then calculated as a function of time. This calculation reveals that <μz> oscillates.\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The resulting equation for the expectation value is of the form <μz>(t) ∝ cos(γBt). The angular frequency of this oscillation, known as the Larmor frequency, is ω = γB. This frequency is fundamental in applications like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nThe calculation confirms that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to γB. The fact that the initial state was aligned along the Z-axis and the new field is along the Y-axis causes the z-component's expectation value to vary, tracing a cosine function with this specific frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis problem describes a classic case of magnetic resonance and Larmor precession. A spin-1/2 particle, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the Z direction, is suddenly subjected to a magnetic field of the same strength but in the Y direction. This causes the particle's spin, and thus its magnetic moment, to precess around the new field direction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the particle's motion:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: At time t=0, the particle's spin is aligned with the +Z direction. This means it is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Magnetic Field**: For t > 0, the magnetic field points along the +Y direction. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, a magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque, causing it to precess around the direction of the field.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession**: This precession is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) and the magnetic field strength (B). The time evolution of the spin is a rotation around the magnetic field axis with frequency ω = γB.\n\n4.  **Motion of the Spin**: The initial spin vector is pointing along the Z-axis. The new magnetic field is along the Y-axis. Therefore, the spin vector will start to precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n\n5.  **Z-Component Oscillation**: As the spin vector rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection will oscillate between its initial maximum value and a minimum value with a cosine dependence. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will be proportional to cos(ωt).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Frequency**: The angular frequency (ω) of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency.\n    *   ω = γB\n\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the z-component of the spin (μz = γ*Sz). Therefore, the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment will also oscillate with the same angular frequency.\n\nThe oscillation is described by `cos(γBt)`, and the angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** At t=0, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Sz operator, specifically the \"spin-up\" state, denoted as |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (H) of the system for t ≥ 0 is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment (μ) and the magnetic field (B):\n    H = -μ ⋅ B\n    Since μ = γS, where S is the spin operator, and B is in the +Y direction (B = Bŷ), the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = - (γS) ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB S_y\n    Here, S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system |ψ(t)⟩ evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, the state at time t is:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of S_z:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z(t)⟩, which is given by:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n    Substituting the expression for |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| e^(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩\n\n5.  **Heisenberg Picture (Alternative approach):** It is often simpler to consider the time evolution of the operator in the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of the S_z operator is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z(t)]\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γBS_y, S_z] = (-iγB/ħ)[S_y, S_z]\n    Using the angular momentum commutation relation [S_y, S_z] = iħS_x, we get:\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħS_x) = γBS_x\n\n    Similarly, we can find the time evolution of S_x:\n    dS_x(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γBS_y, S_x] = (-iγB/ħ)[S_y, S_x]\n    Using [S_x, S_y] = iħS_z, we get [S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z.\n    dS_x(t)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħS_z) = -γBS_z\n\n6.  **Solving the Differential Equations:** We now have a system of coupled differential equations:\n    *   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩\n    *   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩\n\n    Differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation gives:\n    d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB (d⟨S_x⟩/dt) = γB (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩\n\n    This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: d²x/dt² = -ω²x. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation ω is:\n    ω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis in this case) with the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    Initially, the particle's magnetic moment `mu = gamma * S` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`, with the spin pointing up. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n    So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, so `B_vector = B * y_hat`. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system for `t > 0` is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field:\n    `H = -mu . B_vector = -(gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n    Here, `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-gamma * B * Sy) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * Sy * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n\n4.  **Work in the Eigenbasis of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    The calculation is simplest in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `Sy`, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding eigenstates are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n    The energies of these states are the eigenvalues of `H`:\n    *   `E_+y = <+y|H|+y> = -gamma * B * <+y|Sy|+y> = -gamma * B * (ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_-y = <-y|H|-y> = -gamma * B * <-y|Sy|-y> = -gamma * B * (-ħ/2) = +gamma * B * (ħ/2)`\n\n    The energy difference between these two levels is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y = (gamma * B * ħ / 2) - (-gamma * B * ħ / 2) = gamma * B * ħ`.\n\n5.  **Express the Initial State in the New Basis:**\n    We need to write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the standard `Sz` basis:\n    `|+z> = [1, 0]`\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * [1, i]`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * [1, -i]`\n    From these, we can find that:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time-Evolved State:**\n    Now we apply the time evolution operator to the initial state expressed in the `Sy` basis:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y>]`\n    Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-i*E_+y*t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i*E_-y*t/ħ)|-y>]`\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(i * gamma * B * t / 2)|+y> + exp(-i * gamma * B * t / 2)|-y>]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`.\n    `<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| gamma * Sz |ψ(t)> = gamma * <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n\n    To calculate `<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`, it's convenient to switch `|ψ(t)>` back to the `Sz` basis.

Its magnetic moment operator is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, a magnetic field `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The energy eigenvalues of `H_initial` are `-γB(m_s ħ)`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n    *   To minimize the energy, `m_s` must be `+1/2` (assuming a positive `γ`, as is conventional). Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z>` is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`, this is the initial state vector.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (`t ≥ 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the field is switched to `B_new = B ĵ` in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution of the system, is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time-evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting our Hamiltonian `H`:\n        `U(t) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y / ħ)`\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n        `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n    *   We can expand this exponential operator using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = I cos(θ) + iσ_n sin(θ)`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `θ = γBt/2`.\n    *   The state vector at time `t` becomes:\n        `|ψ(t)> = [I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)] |+z>`\n    *   We know that `σ_y |+z>` gives `i|-z>`. Substituting this:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> + i sin(γBt/2) (i|-z>) = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Moment**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we first calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   `S_z` acts on its eigenstates: `S_z|+z> = +(ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`, etc.), the expression simplifies to:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos²(γBt/2) - (ħ/2)sin²(γBt/2)`\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A function of the form `A cos(ωt)` has an angular frequency of `ω`.\n    *   By inspection, the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation of `<μ_z(t)>` is `γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   Initially (for t < 0), the particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B**k̂** (along the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian is H_initial = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**k̂**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin up, |+z⟩) and -ħ/2 (spin down, |-z⟩).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The lower energy state (assuming γ > 0) is the spin-up state, |+z⟩. The expectation value of the magnetic moment for this state is ⟨**μ**⟩ = γ⟨**S**⟩ = γ(ħ/2)**k̂**, which is indeed aligned with the field **B** = B**k̂**.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for t > 0 is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ĵ**) = -γBS_y.\n    *   Because the change is \"sudden\", the state of the system at t=0⁺ is the same as at t=0⁻. So the system starts evolving from the state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ under the influence of the new Hamiltonian H.\n    *   The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrödinger equation, which for a time-independent Hamiltonian has the solution:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    *   We want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n    *   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   To calculate this, it's convenient to express the initial state |+z⟩ in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H (which are the eigenstates of S_y).\n    *   The eigenstates of S_y are:\n        *   |+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) with eigenvalue +ħ/2.\n        *   |-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) with eigenvalue -ħ/2.\n    *   By inverting these relations, we can write the initial state |+z⟩ as:\n        |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩).\n    *   Now, we apply the time evolution operator. The states |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are eigenstates of H = -γBS_y with eigenvalues E_+ = -γB(ħ/2) and E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2) respectively.\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩) ]\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|+y⟩ + exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|-y⟩ ]\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y⟩ + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y⟩ ]\n\n4.  **Find the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   To calculate ⟨S_z(t)⟩, we convert |ψ(t)⟩ back to the S_z basis:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) ]\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z⟩ + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z⟩ ]\n        Using Euler's formulas, cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2 and sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i):\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + i(2i sin(γBt/2))|-z⟩\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n    *   Now we can compute the expectation value of S_z:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩)\n        Since S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩ and S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩, we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = cos²(γBt/2) * (ħ/2) - sin²(γBt/2) * (-ħ/2) = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ):\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt).\n    *   Finally, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n    *   The time dependence of this quantity is given by cos(γBt). A function of the form cos(Ωt) oscillates with an angular frequency Ω.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is Ω = γB.

The expectation value of the magnetic moment of the particle will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the +Y axis) at a specific frequency, known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin is aligned with the Z-axis. When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-axis, the spin vector begins to precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz⟩, therefore oscillates.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, in a magnetic field **B** is given by the equation:\n\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ (⟨**S**⟩ × **B**)\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThis equation shows that the spin vector precesses around the magnetic field vector **B** with an angular frequency of:\n\nω = γB\n\nThis angular frequency is the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's break down the components. The magnetic field is **B** = B**ŷ**. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (⟨Sx⟩, ⟨Sy⟩, ⟨Sz⟩). The cross product results in a set of differential equations:\n*   d⟨Sx⟩/dt = -γB⟨Sz⟩\n*   d⟨Sy⟩/dt = 0\n*   d⟨Sz⟩/dt = γB⟨Sx⟩\n\nTaking the time derivative of the third equation and substituting the first equation into it, we get:\n\nd²⟨Sz⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨Sx⟩/dt) = γB(-γB⟨Sz⟩) = -(γB)²⟨Sz⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency ω is γB. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (`μ = γS`). For the moment to be aligned with the field and the energy to be minimized, the spin must be in the \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as `|+Z>`.\n\n2.  **Change in System**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude, `B`.\n\n3.  **New Hamiltonian**: The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field: `H = -μ · B`. With the new field, this becomes `H = - (γS) · (Bŷ) = -γB S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution**: The initial state `|+Z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time. The expectation value (or average) of any measurement will change. The spin vector will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This precession is called Larmor precession.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. For a magnetic moment `μ = γS` in a magnetic field `B`, the Larmor frequency is given by `ω = |γB|`.\n\n6.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component**: As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The spin starts aligned with `+Z`. As it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will decrease, pass through zero, become negative, and then return to its starting position. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor precession frequency.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z(t)>`, can be calculated to be `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nThe term `cos(γBt)` shows that the value oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nMy analysis confirms that the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency. The phenomenon of a magnetic moment precessing around an external magnetic field is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by the equation ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nIn this problem, the particle's spin is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the z-direction, meaning its spin state is an eigenstate of the z-component of the spin operator, Sz. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction. This precession means that the expectation value of the spin's components in the x and z directions will oscillate.\n\nAs derived through three independent methods in the thought process (Schrödinger picture, Heisenberg picture, and Ehrenfest's theorem), the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz(t)⟩`, will oscillate according to the function `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of the time variable `t`, which is `γB`. This result is a standard outcome in quantum mechanics problems involving spin in a magnetic field.\n\nThe different methods of calculation all yield the same governing differential equation for the expectation value of the z-component of spin, `⟨Sz⟩`:\n\n`d²⟨Sz⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨Sz⟩`\n\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThis is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. The z-component is μz = γSz.\n*   The magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this system is H₀ = -**μ** · **B** = -γB Sz.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of H₀ are the eigenstates of Sz, which are |+z⟩ (spin up) and |-z⟩ (spin down).\n    *   The energy for |+z⟩ (eigenvalue Sz = +ħ/2) is E_up = -γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The energy for |-z⟩ (eigenvalue Sz = -ħ/2) is E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n*   The lowest energy state is E_up, corresponding to the spin-up state |+z⟩.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n**2. Time Evolution (t > 0)**\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB Sy.\n*   The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩.\n*   Substituting H' and |ψ(0)⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB Sy)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt Sy/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n**3. Calculating the Expectation Value ⟨μz⟩(t)**\n\nWe want to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t).\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt Sy/ħ) Sz exp(iγBt Sy/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\nThis calculation can be done in a few ways.\n\n**Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The time-evolved Sz operator, Sz(t), is given by:\nSz(t) = U†SzU, where U = exp(iγBt Sy/ħ).\n\nThe operator U represents a rotation of the spin around the Y-axis by an angle θ = γBt. The transformation for the spin operators under such a rotation is:\n*   Sx(t) = Sx cos(θ) - Sz sin(θ)\n*   Sy(t) = Sy\n*   Sz(t) = Sz cos(θ) + Sx sin(θ)\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz cos(γBt) + Sx sin(γBt).\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value using the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩:\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(0)| Sz(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = ⟨+z| (Sz cos(γBt) + Sx sin(γBt)) |+z⟩\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = cos(γBt) ⟨+z|Sz|+z⟩ + sin(γBt) ⟨+z|Sx|+z⟩\n\nWe know the following:\n*   |+z⟩ is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, ⟨+z|Sz|+z⟩ = ħ/2.\n*   The matrix for Sx in the Sz basis is Sx = (ħ/2)[[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So, Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|-z⟩. This means ⟨+z|Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0, since |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ are orthogonal.\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) + sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\nThe average of the z-component of the moment is:\n⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\n**4. Determining the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe expression for ⟨μz⟩(t) is a cosine function of time: `A cos(ωt)`. By comparing this with our result, ⟨μz⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt), we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is ω = γB.\n\n**Method 2: Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\nClassically, a magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** experiences a torque **τ** = **μ** × **B**. This torque causes the angular momentum (in this case, the spin **S**) to precess according to d**S**/dt = **τ**. Since **μ** = γ**S**, we have:\nd**μ**/dt = γ(**μ** × **B**)\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the magnetic moment vector **μ** around the magnetic field vector **B**. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, given by:\nωL = γB\n\nInitially, the moment **μ** is along the +Z axis. When the field is switched to the +Y axis, the moment vector starts to precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis will vary as cos(ωLt). Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component is the Larmor frequency, ωL = γB.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment (and thus its spin) is in an eigenstate along the +z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +y direction, the spin vector begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`\nwhere `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThis equation indicates that the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` at an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial spin expectation vector points along the +z axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` points along the +y axis.\n*   Therefore, the spin vector will precess around the y-axis. As it rotates in the x-z plane, its projection onto the z-axis (the z-component) will oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of this precession, and consequently the oscillation frequency of its z-component, is the Larmor frequency. The formula for the Larmor frequency `ω` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\nHere, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. The search results confirm that this precessional motion and its corresponding frequency are fundamental concepts in magnetic resonance and spin dynamics.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `⟨Sz⟩`, will oscillate as `cos(γBt)`. Thus, the angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the correct oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the oscillation frequency.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\nThe particle is spin-1/2 and is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin up\" state corresponding to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics notation, the initial state vector `|ψ(0)>` is the eigenstate of the spin-Z operator `S_z` with a positive eigenvalue, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n\n**2. New Hamiltonian:**\nAt time `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The interaction energy of a magnetic moment `μ` with a magnetic field `B` is given by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (`μ = γS`), the new Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution is `H = -γ * B * S_y`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, `B` is the magnetic field magnitude, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n**3. Time Evolution of Expectation Value:**\nWe are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is given by `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. To find this, we need to calculate how the expectation value of the spin operator `S_z` evolves in time, i.e., `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nUsing the laws of quantum mechanics (either the Schrödinger picture by evolving the state vector or the Heisenberg picture by evolving the operator), one can derive the time dependence of `<S_z>(t)`. The result of this calculation is:\n`<S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) * cos(γBt)`\n\n**4. Identifying the Frequency:**\nFrom the result above, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(0) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThis equation describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` (omega) is the angular frequency.

The relationship between its magnetic moment vector `μ` and its spin vector `S` is given by `μ = γS`. This means the components are related as `μ_x = γS_x`, `μ_y = γS_y`, and `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is initially in a uniform magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction). The interaction Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ . B_vec = -γS . (B * z_hat) = -γB S_z`.\n*   **\"Aligned\" with the Field:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This implies the system is in its lowest possible energy state. The energy levels of `H_initial` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+>_z`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|->_z`).\n    *   Energy of `|+>_z`: `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Energy of `|->_z`: `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` (the gyromagnetic ratio) is positive, the lower energy state is `E_+`. This corresponds to the spin-up state `|+>_z`. In this state, the expectation value of the spin `S_z` is `+ħ/2`, and the expectation value of the magnetic moment `μ_z` is `+γħ/2`, which points in the same direction as the magnetic field `B_vec`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the New Hamiltonian and the Dynamics\n*   **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the +Y direction. So, for `t>0`, the magnetic field is `B_vec_new = B * y_hat`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution for `t>0` is `H_new = -μ . B_vec_new = -γS . (B * y_hat) = -γB S_y`.\n*   **System Dynamics:** The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z` is an eigenstate of `S_z`, but it is *not* an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (which depends on `S_y`). Because the state is not a stationary state of the new Hamiltonian, it will evolve in time according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This time evolution manifests as a precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`.\n\nWe can use the general equation for the time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector in a magnetic field (Ehrenfest's theorem), which describes Larmor precession:\n`d<S>/dt = γ <S> x B_vec`\n\nFor our system with `B_vec = B * y_hat`:\n`d<S>/dt = γ (<S_x>x_hat + <S_y>y_hat + <S_z>z_hat) x (B * y_hat)`\n`d<S>/dt = γB [ <S_x>(x_hat x y_hat) + <S_z>(z_hat x y_hat) ]`\n`d<S>/dt = γB [ <S_x>z_hat - <S_z>x_hat ]`\n\nThis gives us a set of coupled differential equations for the components of `<S>`:\n1.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n2.  `d<S_y>/dt = 0`\n3.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n\nWe also need the initial values at `t=0`:\n*   `<S_z>(0) = <+|_z S_z |+>_z = +ħ/2`\n*   `<S_x>(0) = <+|_z S_x |+>_z = 0`\n*   `<S_y>(0) = <+|_z S_y |+>_z = 0`\n\nNow we solve the differential equations. Let's focus on `<S_z>(t)`.\nTake the time derivative of equation (3):\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)`\n\nSubstitute equation (1) into this:\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>)`\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\nBy comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>(t)` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<S_z>(t)`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. The full solution is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nConsequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`, also oscillates with the same frequency. This frequency, `ω = γB`, is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe options provided are in units of angular frequency, so the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Initial State:** Correctly identifying the initial state as `|+>_z` based on the \"alignment\" with the Z-field (lowest energy state).\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** Correctly identifying the Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y` that governs the time evolution after the field is switched.\n*   **Dynamics:** Recognizing that the non-eigenstate `|+>_z` will evolve, leading to precession around the new field axis (Y-axis).\n*   **Observable:** Understanding that the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *expectation value* `<μ_z>(t)`.\n*   **Frequency:** The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe user has provided the output from the Python code execution. I will now analyze this output to confirm the final answer.\n\n### Reasoning and Analysis of Code Output\n\n1.  **Initial Problem Analysis:**\n    *   The initial state `|ψ(0)>` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, as the particle is aligned with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. We denote this as `|+z>`.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`. The system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, so the state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n    *   We are asked for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\n2.  **Code Execution and Output:**\n    *   The Python code was designed to symbolically compute exactly this quantity: `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   The code output is `gamma*hbar*cos(B*gamma*t)/2`.\n    *   Let's write this expression in a clearer format:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((Bγ) * t)`\n\n3.  **Interpreting the Result:**\n    *   This equation describes the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment as a function of time.\n    *   It is a simple sinusoidal oscillation (a cosine function) around zero.\n    *   A general oscillation is described by the functional form `A * cos(ωt + φ)`, where `A` is the amplitude, `ω` is the angular frequency, and `φ` is the phase.\n    *   By comparing our result `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos((γB) * t)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n    *   The term multiplying the time `t` inside the cosine function is `Bγ`.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The symbolic calculation performed by the Python script confirms the result derived from the analytical reasoning using the Ehrenfest theorem. The frequency of oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) `gamma*B`\nB) `gamma*B/sqrt(2)`\nC) `sqrt(2)*gamma*B`\nD) `gamma*B/2`\n\nThe calculated frequency is `γB`, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The magnetic moment of a particle in an external magnetic field will precess about the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin component along any axis is quantized, with possible values of +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ · B`. For the new field, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a time `t` after the switch is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`, where `|ψ(0)⟩` is the initial state `|+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Larmor Precession**: The new Hamiltonian causes the spin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω = γ * B`.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of `<Sz>`**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`. As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial spin was entirely along the Z-axis. As it rotates away from the Z-axis and then back towards it, the value of `<Sz>` changes.\n\nThe frequency of this oscillation is precisely the frequency of the Larmor precession. The angular frequency `ω` of this oscillation is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`. The calculation shows that the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a spin magnetic moment µ aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction, Sz. We can represent this \"spin up\" state as:\n    |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian of the System:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction with magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (H) of a magnetic moment (µ) in a magnetic field (B) is given by H = -µ · B. Since µ = γS, where S is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = -γS · B = -γB S<sub>y</sub>\n\n    Here, S<sub>y</sub> is the spin operator for the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:** The state of the particle at any time *t* is determined by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e<sup>-iHt/ħ</sup> |ψ(0)⟩ = e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> |+z⟩\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:** We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the Z-component of the spin, ⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩, as a function of time. This is calculated as:\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S<sub>z</sub> |ψ(t)⟩\n\n    To solve this, we can express the operators and states in matrix form. In the S<sub>z</sub> basis, the spin operators and the initial state are:\n\n    S<sub>z</sub> = (ħ/2) *  [ 1  0 ]\n                     [ 0 -1 ]\n\n    S<sub>y</sub> = (ħ/2) *  [ 0 -i ]\n                     [ i  0 ]\n\n    |+z⟩ = [ 1 ]\n            [ 0 ]\n\n    The time evolution operator e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> simplifies to:\n    e<sup>i(γBt/2)σ<sub>y</sub></sup> = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ<sub>y</sub>\n\n    where σ<sub>y</sub> is the Pauli Y matrix and I is the identity matrix. This gives:\n\n    e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> = [ cos(γBt/2)  sin(γBt/2) ]\n                      [ -sin(γBt/2) cos(γBt/2) ]\n\n5.  **Finding the State at Time t:**\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)  sin(γBt/2) ] [ 1 ] = [ cos(γBt/2)  ]\n              [ -sin(γBt/2) cos(γBt/2) ] [ 0 ]   [ -sin(γBt/2) ]\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩:**\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)  -sin(γBt/2) ] * (ħ/2) [ 1  0 ] * [ cos(γBt/2)  ]\n                                                     [ 0 -1 ]   [ -sin(γBt/2) ]\n\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ cos(γBt/2)  -sin(γBt/2) ] * [ cos(γBt/2)   ]\n                                                     [ sin(γBt/2)   ]\n\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n7.  **Determining the Oscillation Frequency:** The expression for ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ shows that the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The oscillation is a direct consequence of the spin precessing around the new magnetic field direction.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is therefore γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThis problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is in a spin-up state along the Z-axis. Its state vector `|ψ(0)>` is an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `S_z`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is switched to the Y-direction, `B = B_y`. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ · B = - (γS_y) * B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator in the y-direction.\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The particle's spin state evolves over time. This evolution is equivalent to the spin vector precessing around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis).\n4.  **Oscillation of <μ_z>**: The z-component of the magnetic moment is proportional to the expectation value of the spin operator `S_z`. As the spin precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate.\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by the formula `ω = γB`. This is the frequency at which the expectation value of any spin component perpendicular to the magnetic field will oscillate.\n\nSince the initial spin is along the Z-axis and the new magnetic field is along the Y-axis, the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as it precesses around the Y-axis. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this system is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **μ** = γ**S** is the magnetic moment operator and **S** is the spin operator.\n*   Substituting the values, H₀ = -γ(**S** ⋅ B **ẑ**) = -γB S₂.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   The eigenvalues of S₂ are +ħ/2 (spin-up, |↑⟩₂) and -ħ/2 (spin-down, |↓⟩₂).\n*   The energy levels are E = -γB mₛħ, where mₛ = ±1/2.\n    *   E₊ (for spin-up, mₛ=+1/2): -γB(ħ/2)\n    *   E₋ (for spin-down, mₛ=-1/2): +γB(ħ/2)\n*   Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy state is E₊, which corresponds to the spin-up state |↑⟩₂.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩₂. In the standard S₂ basis, this is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the System for t > 0\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB Sᵧ.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian H. The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution\n\nWe want to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ₂(t)⟩, which is equal to γ⟨S₂(t)⟩.\n⟨S₂(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S₂ |ψ(t)⟩.\n\n#### Method 1: Heisenberg Picture (Equation of Motion)\n\nA more direct way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin operators (Ehrenfest's theorem).\n\nThe equation of motion for an operator A is d⟨A⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩.\nOur Hamiltonian is H = -γB Sᵧ.\n\n1.  **For ⟨S₂⟩:**\n    d⟨S₂⟩/dt = (1/iħ) ⟨[S₂, H]⟩ = (1/iħ) ⟨[S₂, -γB Sᵧ]⟩ = (-γB/iħ) ⟨[S₂, Sᵧ]⟩\n    Using the commutation relation [Sᵧ, S₂] = iħ Sₓ, we get [S₂, Sᵧ] = -iħ Sₓ.\n    d⟨S₂⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ ⟨Sₓ⟩) = γB ⟨Sₓ⟩.\n\n2.  **For ⟨Sₓ⟩:**\n    d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = (1/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, H]⟩ = (1/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, -γB Sᵧ]⟩ = (-γB/iħ) ⟨[Sₓ, Sᵧ]⟩\n    Using the commutation relation [Sₓ, Sᵧ] = iħ S₂, we get:\n    d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ ⟨S₂⟩) = -γB ⟨S₂⟩.\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations:\n(i) d⟨S₂⟩/dt = γB ⟨Sₓ⟩\n(ii) d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt = -γB ⟨S₂⟩\n\nTo solve this, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = γB (d⟨Sₓ⟩/dt)\n\nNow substitute equation (ii) into this:\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = γB (-γB ⟨S₂⟩)\nd²⟨S₂⟩/dt² = -(γB)² ⟨S₂⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x.\nBy comparing the two equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation ω is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) at an angular frequency ω = γB, which is the Larmor frequency. The projection of this precessing vector onto any other axis (like the z-axis) will oscillate with this same angular frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the \"oscillation frequency\". Given the context of physics problems and the form of the answers, this refers to the angular frequency ω.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, ⟨μ₂(t)⟩ = γ⟨S₂(t)⟩, oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The particle is spin-1/2. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   The magnetic moment is given as `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator. So `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ_z B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenvalues of the `S_z` operator are `+ħ/2` (spin-up, `|↑⟩_z`) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down, `|↓⟩_z`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E = -γB (±ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field, the particle must be in its lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy `E = -γB(ħ/2)` corresponds to the spin-up state, `S_z = +ħ/2`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up state in the Z-direction:\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `|↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]`, this is the initial state vector.\n\n### 2.

Calculate the State at Time `t`\n*   We need to evaluate the exponential of the Pauli matrix. A useful identity is `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `σ_k` is any Pauli matrix and `I` is the identity matrix.\n*   In our case, `θ = γBt/2`. So, `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n*   Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]) [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]) [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(γBt/2)|↓⟩_z`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Moment\n*   We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`.\n*   `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   First, let's find `S_z|ψ(t)⟩`:\n    `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]] = (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Next, we calculate the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. The bra `⟨ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|ψ(t)⟩`, so `⟨ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n*   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expression for `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time `t`.\n*   A general oscillation is of the form `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n*   `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The z-component of the spin therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThis problem describes the quantum mechanical phenomenon of Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n**1. Define the Initial State (at t=0):**\n\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment is a vector operator given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ**, pointing along the positive z-axis.\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) for this situation is H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = -γS_zB.\n*   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with this field. In quantum mechanics, this means the particle is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The energy eigenvalues are E = -γB(m_sħ), where m_s = ±1/2. Assuming γ is positive, the lowest energy occurs when the spin projection `m_s` is maximum, which is +1/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle is the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis. We denote this quantum state as |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n**2. Define the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the positive y-axis: **B'** = B**ŷ**.\n*   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the particle's evolution for t > 0, is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γS_yB.\n\n**3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n\nThe expectation value of an observable (like the z-component of the magnetic moment) oscillates when the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates of the governing Hamiltonian. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between these states.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian, H'.**\n    The Hamiltonian H' = -γBS_y is proportional to the S_y spin operator. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y, denoted as |+y⟩ (spin-up along y) and |-y⟩ (spin-down along y).\n    *   The eigenvalues of S_y are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of H' are:\n        *   E₊ = -γB(ħ/2)  (for the state |+y⟩)\n        *   E₋ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2) (for the state |-y⟩)\n\n*   **Step 2: Express the initial state in the new energy basis.**\n    The initial state is |+z⟩. We need to write this as a combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The standard basis transformation is:\n    |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)\n    This shows that the initial state is an equal superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the Bohr Frequency Condition.**\n    When a quantum system is in a superposition of two energy states with energies E₁ and E₂, the system will oscillate between them with an angular frequency (ω) given by the energy difference:\n    ω = |E₁ - E₂| / ħ\n\n    Let's calculate this for our system:\n    *   Energy Difference: ΔE = |E₊ - E₋| = |-γBħ/2 - (+γBħ/2)| = |-γBħ| = γBħ\n    *   Oscillation Frequency: ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nThis frequency, ω = γB, is known as the **Larmor frequency**. The expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, starts by pointing along the z-axis and then precesses in the x-z plane around the y-axis (the direction of the new field) at this frequency. The z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩(t), will therefore oscillate according to cos(γBt).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` in the cosine term, which is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThis is a classic quantum mechanics problem describing the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (at t=0):**\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, **B** = B**ẑ**.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The spin operator S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding energies are E = -γB(±ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming γ (the gyromagnetic ratio) and B are positive, the lowest energy corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of S_z, which is +ħ/2. This is the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the particle at t=0 is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.\n\n2.  **Analyze the System for t > 0:**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B**ŷ**.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y.\n    *   According to the \"sudden approximation,\" the state vector of the system does not change at the instant the Hamiltonian is switched. So, the state at t=0+ is still |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.\n\n3.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency (Method 1: Energy Gap):**\n    *   The initial state |↑⟩_z is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H (which is proportional to S_y). Therefore, the state will evolve in time.\n    *   The state can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H. The time evolution of such a superposition leads to oscillations in the expectation values of observables (like the z-component of the magnetic moment).\n    *   The angular frequency (ω) of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference (ΔE) between the energy levels of the new Hamiltonian, according to the Bohr frequency condition: ω = ΔE/ħ.\n    *   The energy levels of H = -γBS_y are determined by the eigenvalues of S_y, which are also +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n        *   Energy level 1 (eigenvalue +ħ/2 for S_y): E₁ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2.\n        *   Energy level 2 (eigenvalue -ħ/2 for S_y): E₂ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2.\n    *   The energy difference between these two levels is:\n        ΔE = E₂ - E₁ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ.\n    *   The oscillation frequency is therefore:\n        ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB.\n    *   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Verification with Symbolic Computation:**\n    We can use a Python script with `sympy` to verify the calculation of the frequency from the energy gap.\n\n    ```python\n    import sympy\n    \n    # Define symbols for the physical quantities. hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2*pi.\n    hbar, gamma, B = sympy.symbols('hbar gamma B', real=True, positive=True)\n    \n    # The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * S_y. Its energy levels are its eigenvalues.\n    # The eigenvalues of the spin operator S_y are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.\n    # The energy eigenvalues of H are therefore:\n    E1 = -gamma * B * (hbar / 2)\n    E2 = -gamma * B * (-hbar / 2)\n    \n    # The energy difference between the two eigenstates determines the oscillation frequency.\n    Delta_E = E2 - E1\n    \n    # The oscillation angular frequency omega is given by the Bohr frequency condition: omega = Delta_E / hbar.\n    omega = Delta_E / hbar\n    \n    # Print the resulting frequency.\n    print(omega)\n    \n    ```\n\n5.  **Confirmation and Final Answer:**\n    The code output, `B*gamma`, confirms our derivation. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is γB. Looking at the options:\n    A) gamma*B/2\n    B) gamma*B\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\n    The calculated frequency matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nThis physical phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a spin of 1/2 and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the initial state of the particle's spin, at time t=0, is the \"spin up\" state along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Magnetic Field:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude, B. The Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of the system, is now determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment (μ) with this new magnetic field. The Hamiltonian H is given by H = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ĵ**) = -γB*S<sub>y</sub>, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S<sub>y</sub> is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** According to quantum mechanics, the expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the spin, <S<sub>z</sub>>, evolves in time. Its rate of change is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion, which leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components:\n    *   d<S<sub>z</sub>>/dt = γB <S<sub>x</sub>>\n    *   d<S<sub>x</sub>>/dt = -γB <S<sub>z</sub>>\n\n4.  **Solving for the Frequency:** By differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation into it, we arrive at a second-order differential equation for <S<sub>z</sub>>:\n    *   d²<S<sub>z</sub>>/dt² = - (γB)² <S<sub>z</sub>>\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the oscillation frequency ω as:\n    *   ω = γB\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>> = γ<S<sub>z</sub>>, will therefore oscillate with an angular frequency of γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes its angular momentum vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) for a magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. Since the magnetic moment is related to the spin angular momentum **S** by **μ** = γ**S** (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ(Sy * B), where Sy is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at time *t*, |ψ(t)⟩, is given by applying the time evolution operator to the initial state: |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩. In this case, the state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i * γ * B * t * Sy / ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz(t)⟩. This is calculated as ⟨ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)⟩. The operator μz is equal to γ*Sz. As the state |ψ(t)⟩ evolves, this expectation value changes.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Oscillation**: The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of spin, ⟨Sz(t)⟩, oscillates as cos(γBt). The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to this: ⟨μz(t)⟩ ∝ cos(γBt).\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency**: The term inside the cosine function is ωt, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing this to the calculated expression, we can identify the angular frequency ω as γB. This frequency, known as the Larmor frequency, is independent of the initial orientation of the spin relative to the field.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    Initially, the spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, S_z. We'll assume it's the \"spin up\" state, denoted as `|+z⟩`. The magnetic moment is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin vector operator.\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian:**\n    The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system describes the interaction energy between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, given by H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    With the magnetic field **B** = B**ŷ** (where **ŷ** is the unit vector in the Y direction), the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = -γ(S_x **x̂** + S_y **ŷ** + S_z **ẑ**) · (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\n    where `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n    We can calculate the exponential of the Hamiltonian operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n    H = -γB(ħ/2)σ_y.\n    The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp[-i(-γB(ħ/2)σ_y)t/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y]`.\n\n    Using the identity for Pauli matrices, `exp(iθn·σ) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)n·σ`, where **n** is a unit vector. Here, θ = γBt/2 and **n** is the y-direction vector **ŷ**.\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n\n    The initial state `|+z⟩` is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`. Applying the evolution operator:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y] [[1], [0]]`\n    Since σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, this becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\n    This is the state of the particle at time `t`. In the `|+z⟩`, `|-z⟩` basis, it is:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. We need to calculate `⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n    The S_z operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n    This expression describes an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω`. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt)`. By comparing, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n    ω = γB.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The projection of this precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
