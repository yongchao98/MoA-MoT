    "Here is the thinking process to solve the problem by modeling it as a set of constraints and pruning the search space.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Constraints from the Problem Statement\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula Constraint:** Both compounds must have the molecular formula C10H14.\n2.  **Mixture Constraint:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture.\n3.  **Aromatic Region Constraint:** The combined 1H NMR spectrum must show two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio. This means the total number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n4.  **Aliphatic Region Constraint:** The combined 1H NMR spectrum must show three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nThis step involves analyzing the chemical symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. Two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. -> **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. -> **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low. One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments. -> **2 singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Three distinct environments for the methyl groups: (C1, C3), (C2), and (C5). -> **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Medium. One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. -> **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Two distinct environments for the methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). -> **2 singlets (6H, 6H)**, which is a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Candidate 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. Two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent. -> **1 singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa. -> **1 quartet (4H)** and **1 triplet (6H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Prune the Search Space Using the Constraints\n\nWe will now test the possible pairs against the constraints, starting with the most restrictive ones.\n\n*   **Initial Pruning (Aliphatic Signal Type):** The problem states the aliphatic region has *only singlets*. Candidate 4 (1,4-diethylbenzene) produces a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Action:** Eliminate 1,4-diethylbenzene from consideration.\n    *   **Result:** This immediately invalidates option **A)**. We are left with options B, C, and D, which are all pairs of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Testing Remaining Pairs:** We will now check the combined spectra for the remaining pairs.\n\n    *   **Pair B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, assuming different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio**. This **matches** the aromatic constraint.\n        *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this gives **three singlets with a 12H:6H:6H or 2:1:1 integration ratio**. This **matches** the aliphatic constraint.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This pair is a strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Pair C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this gives three signals with a 2H:1H:1H ratio. This **does not match** the \"two signals in a 1:1 ratio\" constraint.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This pair is eliminated.\n\n    *   **Pair D: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this gives three signals with a 2H:1H:1H ratio. This **does not match** the \"two signals in a 1:1 ratio\" constraint.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This pair is eliminated.\n\nThe only pair that satisfies all constraints is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 4: Code Verification\n\nThe following Python code automates the constraint checking process.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef check_constraints():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the NMR problem as constraints to find the correct pair of compounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data Definition ---\n    # Predicted 1H NMR signals for each candidate compound\n    # Format: {name: {'formula': str, 'aromatic': [(multiplicity, integration), ...], 'aliphatic': [...]}}\n    candidates = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 2)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"singlet\", 12)]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 1), (\"singlet\", 1)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"singlet\", 6), (\"singlet\", 3), (\"singlet\", 3)]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 2)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"singlet\", 6), (\"singlet\", 6)]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 4)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"quartet\", 4), (\"triplet\", 6)]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # --- Options to Test ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    # --- Constraint Definitions ---\n    target_formula = \"C10H14\"\n    \n    # Helper function to check ratios\n    def check_ratio(integrations, target_ratio):\n        # Sort both lists to ensure comparison is order-independent\n        return sorted(integrations) == sorted(target_ratio)\n\n    # --- Evaluation Loop ---\n    for option_letter, pair in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Evaluating Option {option_letter}: {pair[0]} and {pair[1]} ---\")\n        \n        c1_name, c2_name = pair\n        c1_data = candidates[c1_name]\n        c2_data = candidates[c2_name]\n        \n        # Constraint 1: Molecular Formula\n        formula_pass = (c1_data[\"formula\"] == target_formula and c2_data[\"formula\"] == target_formula)\n        print(f\"Constraint 1 (Formula C10H14): {'Pass' if formula_pass else 'Fail'}\")\n        if not formula_pass:\n            print(\"-\" * 20 + \"\\n\")\n            continue\n\n        # Constraint 2: Aliphatic signals must all be singlets\n        combined_aliphatic_signals = c1_data[\"aliphatic\"] + c2_data[\"aliphatic\"]\n        all_singlets = all(sig[0] == \"singlet\" for sig in combined_aliphatic_signals)\n        print(f\"Constraint 2 (Aliphatic signals are all singlets): {'Pass' if all_singlets else 'Fail'}\")\n        if not all_singlets:\n            print(\"-\" * 20 + \"\\n\")\n            continue\n\n        # Constraint 3: Aromatic region (2 singlets, 1:1 ratio)\n        combined_aromatic_signals = c1_data[\"aromatic\"] + c2_data[\"aromatic\"]\n        aromatic_integrations = [sig[1] for sig in combined_aromatic_signals]\n        # For a 1:1 ratio with 2 signals, the integrations must be equal (e.g., [2, 2])\n        aromatic_pass = (len(aromatic_integrations) == 2 and aromatic_integrations[0] == aromatic_integrations[1])\n        print(f\"Constraint 3 (Aromatic: 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio): {'Pass' if aromatic_pass else 'Fail'}\")\n\n        # Constraint 4: Aliphatic region (3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio)\n        aliphatic_integrations = [sig[1] for sig in combined_aliphatic_signals]\n        # To check the 2:1:1 ratio, we find the smallest integration unit\n        min_integration = min(aliphatic_integrations) if aliphatic_integrations else 0\n        aliphatic_ratio = [i // min_integration for i in aliphatic_integrations] if min_integration > 0 else []\n        aliphatic_pass = (len(aliphatic_integrations) == 3 and check_ratio(aliphatic_ratio, [2, 1, 1]))\n        print(f\"Constraint 4 (Aliphatic: 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio): {'Pass' if aliphatic_pass else 'Fail'}\")\n        \n        if formula_pass and all_singlets and aromatic_pass and aliphatic_pass:\n            print(f\"\\n>>> Candidate Pair Found: Option {option_letter}\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 20 + \"\\n\")\n\ncheck_constraints()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "An analysis of the constraints leads to the following deductions:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C10H14):** All four listed compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the molecular formula C10H14. This constraint does not prune any single compound initially.\n\n2.  **Signal Multiplicity (Singlets Only):** The problem states that all observed signals are singlets.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. The aliphatic region of its 1H NMR spectrum would show a quartet (for the -CH2- protons) and a triplet (for the -CH3 protons), not singlets.\n    *   **Pruning:** This eliminates 1,4-diethylbenzene as a possibility. Consequently, any option containing it, such as **Option A**, is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Aromatic Region (Two singlets, 1:1 ratio):** The combined spectrum of the 1:1 mixture must show two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Let's predict the aromatic signals for the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers:\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Due to a plane of symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This produces **two singlets (1H each)**.\n\n    Now, let's test the remaining options (B, C, D):\n    *   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This violates the constraint.\n    *   **Option D (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This mixture would also show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets). This violates the constraint.\n    *   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):** This mixture would show two aromatic singlets (one from each compound). Since both are 2H signals and the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This matches the constraint.\n\n4.  **Aliphatic Region (Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio):** Let's check if Option B also satisfies this final constraint.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This produces **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Spectrum for Option B:** The mixture would show three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the constraint.\n\nBoth constraints are satisfied only by the mixture in Option B.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef check_constraints():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the NMR problem as constraints to find the correct pair of compounds.\n    This function analyzes the predicted NMR spectra of candidate molecules against the problem's constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data Definition ---\n    # Predicted 1H NMR signals for each candidate compound based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n    # Format: {name: {'formula': str, 'aromatic': [(multiplicity, integration), ...], 'aliphatic': [...]}}\n    candidates = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 2)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"singlet\", 12)]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 1), (\"singlet\", 1)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"singlet\", 6), (\"singlet\", 3), (\"singlet\", 3)]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 2)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"singlet\", 6), (\"singlet\", 6)]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"formula\": \"C10H14\",\n            \"aromatic\": [(\"singlet\", 4)],\n            \"aliphatic\": [(\"quartet\", 4), (\"triplet\", 6)]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # --- Options to Test ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    # --- Constraint Definitions ---\n    target_formula = \"C10H14\"\n    \n    # Helper function to check ratios\n    def check_ratio(integrations, target_ratio):\n        # Sort both lists to ensure comparison is order-independent\n        return sorted(integrations) == sorted(target_ratio)\n\n    # --- Evaluation Loop ---\n    final_candidate = None\n    for option_letter, pair in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Evaluating Option {option_letter}: {pair[0]} and {pair[1]} ---\")\n        \n        c1_name, c2_name = pair\n        c1_data = candidates[c1_name]\n        c2_data = candidates[c2_name]\n        \n        # Constraint 1: Molecular Formula (All candidates have C10H14)\n        formula_pass = (c1_data[\"formula\"] == target_formula and c2_data[\"formula\"] == target_formula)\n        print(f\"Constraint 1 (Formula C10H14): {'Pass' if formula_pass else 'Fail'}\")\n\n        # Constraint 2: Aliphatic signals must all be singlets (Pruning step)\n        combined_aliphatic_signals = c1_data[\"aliphatic\"] + c2_data[\"aliphatic\"]\n        all_singlets = all(sig[0] == \"singlet\" for sig in combined_aliphatic_signals)\n        print(f\"Constraint 2 (Aliphatic signals are all singlets): {'Pass' if all_singlets else 'Fail'}\")\n\n        # Constraint 3: Aromatic region (2 singlets, 1:1 ratio)\n        combined_aromatic_signals = c1_data[\"aromatic\"] + c2_data[\"aromatic\"]\n        aromatic_integrations = [sig[1] for sig in combined_aromatic_signals]\n        # For a 1:1 ratio with 2 signals, the integrations must be equal (e.g., [2, 2])\n        aromatic_pass = (len(aromatic_integrations) == 2 and aromatic_integrations[0] == aromatic_integrations[1])\n        print(f\"Constraint 3 (Aromatic: 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio): {'Pass' if aromatic_pass else 'Fail'}\")\n\n        # Constraint 4: Aliphatic region (3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio)\n        aliphatic_integrations = [sig[1] for sig in combined_aliphatic_signals]\n        # To check the 2:1:1 ratio, we find the smallest integration unit\n        min_integration = min(aliphatic_integrations) if aliphatic_integrations else 0\n        aliphatic_ratio = [i // min_integration for i in aliphatic_integrations] if min_integration > 0 else []\n        aliphatic_pass = (len(aliphatic_integrations) == 3 and check_ratio(aliphatic_ratio, [2, 1, 1]))\n        print(f\"Constraint 4 (Aliphatic: 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio): {'Pass' if aliphatic_pass else 'Fail'}\")\n        \n        if formula_pass and all_singlets and aromatic_pass and aliphatic_pass:\n            final_candidate = option_letter\n            print(f\"\\n>>> Candidate Pair Found: Option {option_letter}\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 20 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Final determination: The correct option is {final_candidate}.\")\n\ncheck_constraints()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
