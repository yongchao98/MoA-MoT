    """
    Checks the answer to a question about organic chemistry lab vernacular.

    The function encodes the reasoning process an organic chemist would use:
    1. Identify the lab technique implied by the phrase "on top of each other".
    2. Identify the physical principle that governs that technique.
    3. Determine which option correctly describes a failure condition for that principle.
