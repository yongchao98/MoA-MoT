    # 1. Define the symbolic variables.
    # r: distance
    # plx: parallax
    # rho: a positive constant representing the uniform star density.
    r, plx, rho = sympy.symbols('r plx rho', positive=True, real=True)
    
    # We use a proportionality constant 'k' to represent all constant factors
    # like 4/3, pi, and rho.
    k = sympy.Symbol('k', positive=True, real=True)

    # 2. Constraint: Uniform star distribution.
    # The number of stars N up to a distance r is proportional to the volume of
    # the sphere of radius r.
    # Volume V is proportional to r^3.
    # So, N(r) is proportional to r^3.
    N_of_r = k * r**3

    # 3. Constraint: Definition of parallax.
    # Parallax is inversely proportional to distance.
    # r = 1/plx (ignoring constants for proportionality check)
    r_of_plx = 1 / plx

    # 4. Synthesize: Express the number of stars N as a function of parallax.
    # Substitute the expression for r into the equation for N.
    N_of_plx = N_of_r.subs(r, r_of_plx)
    
    # 5. Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.
    # This is the (magnitude of the) derivative of N with respect to plx, dN/d(plx).
    # The derivative will be negative because as parallax increases, distance decreases,
    # and the total number of stars within that distance also decreases.
    # The number density in a parallax shell must be positive, so we are interested
    # in the magnitude of this rate of change.
    num_density_plx = sympy.Abs(sympy.diff(N_of_plx, plx))

    # 6. Analyze the final expression.
    # We want to see how num_density_plx depends on plx.
    # The expression should be of the form (some_constant) / plx^4.
    
    # We can use sympy's `as_powers_dict` to check the power of plx.
    powers = num_density_plx.as_powers_dict()
    
    # The dictionary should contain one key, plx, with a value of -4.
    # The constant part is k*3, which is not relevant for proportionality.

        # The derivation is correct. The number of stars per unit parallax
        # is proportional to 1/plx^4.
