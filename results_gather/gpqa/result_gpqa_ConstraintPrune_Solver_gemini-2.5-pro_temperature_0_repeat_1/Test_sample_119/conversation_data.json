    "Here is the derivation based on the provided constraints.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\nThe problem can be solved by establishing a series of constraints based on geometric and physical principles.\n\n1.  **Constraint: Uniform Star Distribution**\n    *   The primary assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n    *   Let `ρ` be the constant number density of stars (number of stars per unit volume).\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Pass. This is the fundamental starting point.\n\n2.  **Constraint: Number of Stars in a Volume Shell**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars, `dN`, within a thin spherical shell of radius `r` and thickness `dr`.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, is its surface area (`4πr²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dr`). So, `dV = 4πr² dr`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πr² dr`.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Pass. This correctly relates the number of stars to the volume of a thin shell.\n\n3.  **Constraint: Relationship between Distance and Parallax**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is, by definition, inversely proportional to distance (`r`).\n    *   `plx = 1/r` (assuming standard units, e.g., `r` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n    *   This implies `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Pass. This is the correct definition of parallax.\n\n4.  **Constraint: Relating Differential Elements**\n    *   The goal is to find the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`. We currently have `dN` in terms of `dr`. We must find the relationship between `dr` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We differentiate `r = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dr/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Since a number of stars must be positive, we are interested in the magnitude of the change, so we relate the differential elements as: `dr = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Pass. This correctly relates the differential thickness of the shell in terms of distance to the differential interval of parallax.\n\n### Final Synthesis and Pruning\n\nNow, we combine the constraints to find the final relationship. This process prunes the incorrect options.\n\n*   Start with the number of stars in the shell:\n    `dN = ρ * 4πr² dr`\n*   Substitute `r = 1/plx` and `dr = (1/plx²) d(plx)` into the equation:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n*   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result matches option C and prunes options A, B, and D.\n\n<<<C>>>"
