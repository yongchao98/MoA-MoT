    "The task is to determine the correct methodology for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a novel retrovirus. I will model this by establishing key constraints based on the question and pruning the options that fail to meet them.\n\n**Constraint 1: The target is a retrovirus.**\nA retrovirus has an RNA genome. To use nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, the viral RNA must first be converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Any valid method must account for this step.\n\n**Constraint 2: The deliverable is a \"molecular diagnostic kit\".**\nThis specifies that the kit must detect the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of the virus. Methods that detect the host's immune response, such as antibodies (e.g., IgG, IgM), are serological, not molecular, and are therefore excluded.\n\n**Constraint 3: The scientific methodology must be sound.**\nThe proposed steps for identifying the virus and designing the kit must be scientifically valid. For instance, designing a highly specific test like PCR requires knowing the target's genetic sequence, which cannot be inferred from clinical symptoms alone.\n\nI will now evaluate the options against these constraints.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_diagnostic_design():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the task as constraints and prunes the options.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"description\": \"First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.

It correctly identifies the need for a molecular kit, proposes a scientifically sound method for identifying the virus (sequencing), and accurately specifies that for an RNA retrovirus, this process involves creating and sequencing cDNA. Real-time PCR is the modern standard for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics.\n\n<<<A>>>",
