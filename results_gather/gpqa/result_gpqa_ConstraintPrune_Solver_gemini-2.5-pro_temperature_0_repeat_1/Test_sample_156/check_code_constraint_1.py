    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the retrovirus diagnostic kit question.

    The question requires designing a *molecular* diagnostic kit for a *retrovirus*.
    Key scientific principles:
    1.  **Retrovirus:** Has an RNA genome. To analyze its sequence using PCR-based methods, the RNA must first be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase.
    2.  **Molecular Diagnosis:** This involves detecting the pathogen's genetic material (RNA or DNA), not the host's immune response (like antibodies).
    3.  **Kit Design:** Designing a PCR-based kit requires knowing the specific genetic sequence of the target to create primers. This sequence must be identified first.

    Analysis of options:
    -   **A) cDNA sequencing -> real time PCR:** Correct. It correctly identifies that a retrovirus's RNA must be converted to cDNA for sequencing. Real-time PCR (often RT-qPCR for RNA viruses) is a standard, quick, and accurate molecular diagnostic method.
    -   **B) DNA sequencing -> PCR:** Incorrect. A retrovirus has an RNA genome. Direct DNA sequencing is the wrong initial step.
    -   **C) IgG antibodies -> ELISA:** Incorrect. This describes an immunological/serological test, not a *molecular* diagnostic test. It detects the host's immune response, not the virus's genetic material.
    -   **D) Symptoms -> nested PCR:** Incorrect. You cannot design a specific PCR kit based on symptoms alone. You need the virus's genetic sequence to design the necessary primers.

This option incorrectly suggests direct DNA sequencing."

        return "Incorrect. The question asks for the design of a *molecular* diagnostic kit, which detects the pathogen's genetic material (RNA/DNA). An ELISA kit that targets IgG antibodies is an *immunological* or *serological* test, which detects the host's immune response, not the virus's genetic material directly."
    elif answer == 'D':
        return "Incorrect. It is not possible to design a specific molecular test like a PCR kit based solely on patient symptoms. Designing PCR primers requires the precise genetic sequence of the target virus, which must be determined through molecular methods like sequencing, not by observing clinical symptoms."
