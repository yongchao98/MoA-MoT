    # --- Derivation and Calculation ---
    # From physics:
    # 1. The star's radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the max wavelength shift Δλ.
    #    So, K2 / K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1
    # 2. For constant star and planet masses, K is proportional to T^(-1/3), where T is the period.
    #    So, K2 / K1 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3) = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)
    #
    # Equating the two expressions for K2 / K1:
    #    Δλ2 / Δλ1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)
    #
    # To find the ratio T2 / T1, we first cube both sides:
    #    (Δλ2 / Δλ1)^3 = T1 / T2
    #
    # Then, we take the reciprocal of both sides:
    #    T2 / T1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^3
