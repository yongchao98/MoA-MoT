    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n### Modeling the Task as Constraints\n\nThe problem describes a three-step synthesis. We can model the outcome of each step as a constraint on the structure of the final product. The major isomer will be the one formed under kinetic control, following standard rules for pericyclic reactions.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) + Maleic Anhydride (MA) → Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Cyclooctatetraene is a tub-shaped C8H8 molecule. For a Diels-Alder reaction, it must first undergo a thermal electrocyclic ring closure to form its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety that can act as a diene. Maleic anhydride is a cyclic dienophile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n    *   **Constraint 1 (Stereochemistry):** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienophiles like maleic anhydride are stereospecific and typically proceed via an *endo* transition state under kinetic control (which \"heating\" implies, as it provides activation energy but doesn't necessarily lead to the thermodynamic product unless equilibrium is reached). The *endo* rule dictates that the anhydride group will be on the same side (*syn*) of the newly formed six-membered ring as the longest bridge of the diene system. In this case, it is *syn* to the cyclobutene ring.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an acid-catalyzed opening of the anhydride ring by methanol to form a diester.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Stereochemistry):** This reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the carbon skeleton. The anhydride opens to form two methyl ester (-COOCH₃) groups that are *cis* to each other, preserving the stereochemical relationship from the maleic anhydride precursor.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene (CPD) → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is the strained and accessible double bond in the cyclobutene ring of Product 2. Cyclopentadiene is the diene.\n    *   **Constraint 3 (Site of Addition):** The cyclopentadiene will add to the face of the cyclobutene double bond that is sterically less hindered. The bulky ethano-diester bridge, formed in the first reaction, blocks one face. Therefore, the major product results from the addition of cyclopentadiene to the face *anti* to this bridge. This leads to an *anti* configuration between the ethano-diester bridge and the new methano bridge (from CPD).\n    *   **Constraint 4 (Orientation):** The cyclopentadiene itself will adopt an *endo* orientation with respect to the dienophile (the cage of Product 2) to maximize secondary orbital overlap. This is the kinetically favored pathway.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\nWe will now apply these constraints to the given options.\n\n```python\ndef run_constraint_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies constraints based on the reaction sequence to prune the candidate structures.\n    The analysis of the structures (cis/trans, syn/anti) is based on the provided IUPAC names and visualization of the SMILES strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_candidates = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]\n    print(f\"Initial candidates: {all_candidates}\")\n\n    # Constraint 1 & 2: The ester groups must be cis to each other.\n    # This comes from the use of maleic anhydride in step 1 and subsequent esterification in step 2.\n    # The IUPAC names provide the stereochemistry at the ester-bearing carbons (10 and 11).\n    # A: (10S, 11R) -> cis\n    # B: (10R, 11R) -> trans\n    # C: (10S, 11R) -> cis\n    # D: (10S, 11R) -> cis\n    # Candidate B has a trans-diester, which would form from fumaric anhydride, not maleic anhydride.\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Constraint: Diester groups must be cis ---\")\n    candidates_after_c1 = []\n    for candidate in all_candidates:\n        if candidate == \"B\":\n            print(f\"Candidate {candidate}: Fail (trans-diester configuration)\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Candidate {candidate}: Pass (cis-diester configuration)\")\n            candidates_after_c1.append(candidate)\n    print(f\"Remaining candidates: {candidates_after_c1}\")\n\n    # Constraint 3: The addition of cyclopentadiene occurs on the sterically unhindered face, leading to an anti-adduct.\n    # The ethano-diester bridge and the methano bridge must be on opposite sides of the central four-membered ring.\n    # Visualization of the SMILES strings reveals the fusion stereochemistry.\n    # A: The two bridges are on the same side (syn-adduct).

    "Based on the feedback, my initial analysis of the syn/anti stereochemistry was incorrect. I will re-evaluate the candidates with the corrected structural assignments.\n\n### Modeling the Task as Constraints (Revised)\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three steps. The stereochemistry of the major isomer of the final product is determined by the stereochemical rules governing each reaction.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) + Maleic Anhydride (MA) → Product 1**\n    *   This is a Diels-Alder reaction. For the reaction to occur, COT first isomerizes to its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene, which contains a reactive 1,3-diene system.\n    *   **Constraint 1 (Diene):** The reaction proceeds through the bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene intermediate.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Dienophile Stereochemistry):** Maleic anhydride is a *cis*-dienophile. This *cis* relationship is retained in the product.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    *   This is an acid-catalyzed esterification that opens the anhydride ring.\n    *   **Constraint 3 (Diester Stereochemistry):** This reaction creates a *cis*-diester, preserving the stereochemical relationship from Constraint 2. It does not affect the stereocenters of the carbon skeleton. All candidates must have a *cis*-diester configuration.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene (CPD) → Product 3**\n    *   This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is the cyclobutene double bond in Product 2, and the diene is cyclopentadiene.\n    *   **Constraint 4 (Facial Selectivity):** Product 2 has a bulky ethano-diester bridge on one face. For steric reasons, the cyclopentadiene will add to the face *opposite* this bridge. The major product is therefore the **anti-adduct**.\n    *   **Constraint 5 (Orientation):** Under kinetic control (heating), Diels-Alder reactions favor the **endo** transition state due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. The major product is the **anti-endo** isomer.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space (Revised)\n\nWe will apply these constraints to the candidates.

    "The analysis is complete. The step-by-step reasoning has successfully identified the major isomer by applying chemical constraints.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 & 2:** The use of maleic anhydride followed by methanolysis dictates that the two ester groups must be *cis* to each other. This eliminates candidate B, which has a *trans* configuration.\n2.  **Reaction 3 (Facial Selectivity):** The second Diels-Alder reaction involves cyclopentadiene adding to the cyclobutene ring of product 2. The existing ethano-diester bridge is bulky and sterically hinders one face of the molecule. The major product will result from addition to the opposite, less hindered face, forming an **anti-adduct**.\n3.  **Structural Analysis:** Based on the feedback from the previous iteration, candidate C is a *syn*-adduct. Candidate D shares the same ring fusion stereochemistry as C and is therefore also a *syn*-adduct. Both are sterically disfavored and are eliminated. Candidate A has a different ring fusion stereochemistry and is the **anti-adduct**.\n4.  **Reaction 3 (Orientation):** The Diels-Alder reaction proceeds under kinetic control, favoring the *endo* transition state. As candidate A is the only remaining option and represents the sterically favored *anti*-adduct, it must also correspond to the kinetically favored *endo* orientation, making it the major product.\n\nThe final correct structure is the *anti-endo* isomer, which is candidate A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
