    "The user wants to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` to `system_2`.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **Physical Law:** The total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P), the sum of the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 + K2), and the orbital inclination (i) by the formula:\n    M = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2 * π * G * sin³(i)]\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  **Pruning with Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This implies an orbital inclination `i ≈ 90°`, which means `sin(i) ≈ 1`. This crucial piece of information simplifies the formula and removes the `sin³(i)` dependency, allowing for a direct calculation of the mass.\n\n3.  **Mass Ratio Calculation:** We need to find the ratio M_system1 / M_system2.\n    M1 / M2 = { [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [2πG] } / { [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³] / [2πG] }\n    The constant term `2πG` cancels out, leaving a direct relationship between the observable quantities:\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) ]³\n\n**Data:**\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 = 10 km/s\n    *   K1_2 = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K2_2 = 10 km/s\n\nThe calculation can now proceed without needing the value of G or converting units, as long as the units are consistent for the ratio (years for period, km/s for velocity).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Input Data ---\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Options\noptions = {'A': 0.6, 'B': 0.4, 'C': 1.2, 'D': 0.7}\n\n# --- Constraint Definitions and Checks ---\n\n# Constraint 1: The systems are eclipsing, implying inclination i ≈ 90 degrees.\n# This allows us to assume sin(i) ≈ 1 and use the simplified mass ratio formula.\n# This is an assumption based on the problem statement, not a calculation.\nis_eclipsing = True\nprint(\"Constraint 1: Systems are eclipsing, so sin(i) is assumed to be 1.\")\nprint(f\"Pass/Fail: {'Pass' if is_eclipsing else 'Fail'}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Constraint 2: The mass ratio M1/M2 is calculated from the observable periods and velocities.\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ( (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) )^3\ndef check_mass_ratio(p1, k1_1, k1_2, p2, k2_1, k2_2):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the mass ratio and identifies the closest option.\"\"\"\n    k_sum_1 = k1_1 + k1_2\n    k_sum_2 = k2_1 + k2_2\n    \n    # Ensure no division by zero, although not an issue with given data\n    if p2 == 0 or k_sum_2 == 0:\n        return None, None\n\n    period_ratio = p1 / p2\n    velocity_sum_ratio = k_sum_1 / k_sum_2\n    \n    mass_ratio = period_ratio * (velocity_sum_ratio ** 3)\n    \n    # Find the closest option\n    closest_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - mass_ratio))\n    \n    return mass_ratio, closest_option\n\n# --- Calculation and Final Output ---\ncandidate_ratio, best_option = check_mass_ratio(P1, K1_1, K1_2, P2, K2_1, K2_2)\n\nprint(f\"Constraint 2: Calculate mass ratio M1/M2.\")\nprint(f\"Sum of velocities for System 1: {K1_1 + K1_2} km/s\")\nprint(f\"Sum of velocities for System 2: {K2_1 + K2_2} km/s\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Mass Ratio (M1/M2): {candidate_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n# Final check: Does the calculated ratio closely match one of the options?\nis_close = math.isclose(candidate_ratio, options[best_option], rel_tol=0.1)\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio is closest to option {best_option} ({options[best_option]}).\")\nprint(f\"Pass/Fail: {'Pass' if is_close else 'Fail'}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(f\"Candidate Answer: {best_option}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
