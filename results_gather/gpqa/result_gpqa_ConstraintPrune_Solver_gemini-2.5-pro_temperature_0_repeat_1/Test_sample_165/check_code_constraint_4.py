def check_correctness_of_mass_formula(llm_answer_choice: str):
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected formula for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass.

    The function verifies the answer against several physics constraints derived from the
    Coleman-Weinberg mechanism for radiative mass generation.

    Constraints:
    1.  Dimensionality/Scaling: The mass-squared (M^2) must be dimensionally correct.
        For a one-loop radiative mass, M^2 is proportional to (loop factor) * Sum(M_i^4) / f^2,
        where f is the symmetry-breaking scale. Here, f^2 is given by (x^2 + v^2).
        Therefore, the formula must be proportional to 1 / (x^2 + v^2).
    2.  Particle Content Completeness: The loop correction must sum over all massive particles
        in the theory whose masses are generated by the relevant VEVs. This includes
        Standard Model particles (h1, W, Z, t) and the new particles (H+/-, H0, A0, N_i).
    3.  Sign Convention (Supertrace): In the supertrace formalism (Str[M^4]), bosons
        (spin 0, 1) contribute with a positive sign, while fermions (spin 1/2) contribute
        with a negative sign. The coefficients alpha_i are defined as positive.

    Args:
        llm_answer_choice (str): The letter corresponding to the LLM's chosen answer (e.g., 'B').

    Returns:
        str: "Correct" if the answer satisfies all constraints, otherwise a string
             explaining the reason for the failure.
