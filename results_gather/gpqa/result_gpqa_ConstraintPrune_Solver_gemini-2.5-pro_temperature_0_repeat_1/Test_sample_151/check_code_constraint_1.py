    # We assign a score for "relevance_to_active_transcription". A lower score means
    # it's less likely to be found in the assay.
    # - Nucleosomes are the base material, so they are very abundant.
    # - PIC and Enhancer complexes are the machinery of active transcription.
    # - Pre-RC is for replication, not transcription.
