    "The user wants to identify two compounds based on their chemical properties related to isomerism.\n\n**Constraint Modeling & Pruning**\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Constraint:** A compound shows keto-enol tautomerism if it has at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group, C=O). The question asks for the compound that does *not* show tautomerism.\n*   **Candidate 1: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   Analysis: The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n    *   Pruning: Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It is a candidate for (A).\n*   **Candidate 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Analysis: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each is a CH₂ group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Pruning: Since it has alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo tautomerism (to its highly stable enol form, phloroglucinol). It is not a candidate for (A).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Constraint:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   Analysis: The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Pruning: This carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. It is a candidate for (B).\n*   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (trans isomer)\n    *   Analysis: The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Pruning: The molecule is achiral. It will not exhibit optical isomerism. It is not a candidate for (B).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   (A) Does not show tautomerism: **Benzoquinone**\n*   (B) Shows optical isomerism: **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n```python\ndef check_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes chemical compounds based on tautomerism and optical isomerism constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"benzoquinone\": {\n            \"alpha_hydrogens\": False,\n            \"chiral_center\": False\n        },\n        \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\": {\n            \"alpha_hydrogens\": True,\n            \"chiral_center\": False\n        },\n        \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\": {\n            \"alpha_hydrogens\": True, # It has an alpha-H on C3, but this is not the primary question\n            \"chiral_center\": True\n        },\n        \"dimethyl fumarate\": {\n            \"alpha_hydrogens\": False,\n            \"chiral_center\": False\n        }\n    }\n\n    # --- Part A: Find the compound that does NOT show tautomerism ---\n    print(\"--- Constraint A: Does NOT show tautomerism (requires no alpha-hydrogens) ---\")\n    candidate_A = None\n    for name, props in compounds.items():\n        if name in [\"benzoquinone\", \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\"]:\n            if not props[\"alpha_hydrogens\"]:\n                print(f\"PASS: {name} has no alpha-hydrogens and does not show tautomerism.\")\n                candidate_A = name\n            else:\n                print(f\"FAIL: {name} has alpha-hydrogens and shows tautomerism.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCandidate for A is: {candidate_A}\")\n\n    # --- Part B: Find the compound that WILL show optical isomerism ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Constraint B: Shows optical isomerism (requires a chiral center) ---\")\n    candidate_B = None\n    for name, props in compounds.items():\n        if name in [\"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", \"dimethyl fumarate\"]:\n            if props[\"chiral_center\"]:\n                print(f\"PASS: {name} has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.\")\n                candidate_B = name\n            else:\n                print(f\"FAIL: {name} has no chiral center and does not show optical isomerism.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nCandidate for B is: {candidate_B}\")\n\n    # --- Final Check ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Check ---\")\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"benzoquinone\", \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"),\n        \"B\": (\"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"dimethyl fumarate\"),\n        \"C\": (\"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"),\n        \"D\": (\"benzoquinone\", \"dimethyl fumarate\")\n    }\n\n    for option, values in options.items():\n        if values == (candidate_A, candidate_B):\n            print(f\"PASS: Option {option} matches the candidates (A={candidate_A}, B={candidate_B}).\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"FAIL: Option {option} does not match the candidates.\")\n\ncheck_properties()\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
