    Checks the calculation for the comoving distance to a quasar based on its spectrum.

    The function verifies the following steps from the provided answer:
    1. Assumes the spectral feature at 790 nm is the Lyman limit (rest wavelength 91.2 nm).
    2. Calculates the corresponding redshift (z).
    3. Computes the comoving distance using the given Lambda-CDM parameters.
    4. Compares the result with the provided options to see if it matches option D (9 Gpc).
