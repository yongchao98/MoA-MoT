    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **System Identification:** The potential is $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n2.  **Energy Eigenvalue Constraint:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_N = (N + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number ($N=0, 1, 2, ...$). The energy is quantized in units of $\\hbar\\omega$. Options with a different energy form, such as those for a particle in a box ($E \\propto \\hbar^2 / (mr^2)$), can be eliminated.\n3.  **Excited State Constraint:** The states are defined by the value of $N$:\n    *   Ground State: $N=0$\n    *   First Excited State: $N=1$\n    *   Second Excited State: $N=2$\n    *   Third Excited State: $N=3$\n    This constraint allows us to calculate the specific energy value.\n4.  **Degeneracy Constraint:** The degeneracy ($g_N$) of an energy level $N$ is the number of distinct combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $N$. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, this is given by the formula $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. This allows us to calculate the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the given energy.\n\n**Pruning the Search Space:**\n\n*   **Applying Constraint 2 (Energy Form):** The energy must be of the form $(...)\\hbar\\omega$. Options C and D have an energy form of $... \\hbar^2 / (mr^2)$, which corresponds to a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, C and D are incorrect.\n*   **Remaining Candidates:** A and B.\n*   **Applying Constraint 3 (Energy Value):** For the third excited state, $N=3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$. Both options A and B have this correct energy value.\n*   **Applying Constraint 4 (Degeneracy):** For the third excited state, $N=3$. The degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n*   **Final Pruning:** Option A has a degeneracy of 3, which is incorrect. Option B has a degeneracy of 10, which is correct.\n\nThis logical process identifies B as the only valid answer. The following code automates this check.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# Store original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\ndef check_candidates():\n    # Candidates based on the provided options\n    # Format: { 'Option': ('Energy Expression String', Degeneracy) }\n    candidates = {\n        'A': ('(9/2) * hbar * w', 3),\n        'B': ('(9/2) * hbar * w', 10),\n        'C': ('11 * pi**2 * hbar**2 / (2*m*r**2)', 10),\n        'D': ('11 * pi**2 * hbar**2 / (2*m*r**2)', 3)\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Initial Candidates:\")\n    for key, val in candidates.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: Energy = {val[0]}, Degeneracy = {val[1]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Constraint 1: Energy Form for 3D Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator ---\n    # The energy must be proportional to hbar*w, not hbar^2/(m*r^2).\n    print(\"Constraint 1: Energy form must be for a harmonic oscillator (proportional to hbar*w).\")\n    passed_c1 = {}\n    for key, val in candidates.items():\n        energy_expr, _ = val\n        if \"hbar * w\" in energy_expr:\n            status = \"Pass\"\n            passed_c1[key] = val\n        else:\n            status = \"Fail\"\n        print(f\"Candidate {key}: {status}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Constraint 2: Energy Value for the Third Excited State (N=3) ---\n    # E_N = (N + 3/2) * hbar * w.
