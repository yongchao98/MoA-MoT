    "Here is the step-by-step solution modeling the problem as a series of constraints.\n\n### Initial Analysis and Constraints\n\n1.  **Reactants:** An equimolar mixture of salt A and salt B.\n    *   `moles(A) = moles(B) = n`\n    *   `mass(A) + mass(B) = 7.20 g`\n    *   `n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g` (where M_A, M_B are molar masses)\n\n2.  **Reaction:** Thermal decomposition at 200°C.\n    *   `A(s) + B(s) -> Gas Mixture`\n    *   No solid or liquid residue remains.\n\n3.  **Products (from gas analysis):**\n    *   **Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs H₂O.\n        *   `mass(H₂O) = 3.60 g`\n        *   `moles(H₂O) = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol`\n    *   **Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂):** Absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂, SO₂).\n        *   Weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube 3 (hot Cu):** Reacts with O₂.\n        *   `mass increase = mass(O) = 0.80 g`\n        *   The reaction is `2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO`. The mass increase is due to oxygen atoms.\n        *   `moles(O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is O₂, `moles(O₂) = moles(O) / 2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol`.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** Inert to all previous steps.\n        *   `volume(C) = 2.24 L` at STP.\n        *   `moles(C) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol`.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\n*   **Elemental Composition:** The products are H₂O, O₂, and an inert gas C. The elements in the products are H, O, and the elements in C. Since the salts A and B are the source, they must contain H and O. The lack of CO₂ rules out Carbon. The most plausible inert gas C formed from a salt decomposition is Nitrogen (N₂).\n*   **Mass Conservation Check:**\n    *   `mass(H) = 0.20 mol H₂O * 2 H/H₂O * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g`\n    *   `mass(O) = 0.20 mol H₂O * 1 O/H₂O * 16.0 g/mol + 0.025 mol O₂ * 2 O/O₂ * 16.0 g/mol = 3.2 g + 0.8 g = 4.0 g`\n    *   `mass(N) = 0.10 mol N₂ * 2 N/N₂ * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g`\n    *   `Total product mass = 0.4 + 4.0 + 2.8 = 7.2 g`. This matches the initial reactant mass, confirming our product identification (H₂O, O₂, N₂) is correct.\n*   **Candidate Salts:** Salts containing only N, H, and O that decompose into gases are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common candidates are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n### Hypothesis and Verification\n\nLet's hypothesize:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nTheir decomposition reactions that fit the products are:\n1.  `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n2.  `2NH₄NO₃(s) -> 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n    *   Or, per mole: `NH₄NO₃(s) -> N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nNow, we can verify this hypothesis against the quantitative constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constraints from Problem Statement ---\ninitial_mass = 7.20  # g\nmoles_H2O_exp = 3.60 / 18.015\nmoles_O2_exp = 0.80 / (15.999 * 2)\nmoles_N2_exp = 2.24 / 22.4\n\nprint(\"--- Experimental Data ---\")\nprint(f\"Moles H2O: {moles_H2O_exp:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles O2:  {moles_O2_exp:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles N2:  {moles_N2_exp:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 25)\n\n# --- Hypothesis: Define Candidate Salts and Reactions ---\n# Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\nM_A = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 2  # g/mol\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n# Reaction A: NH4NO2 -> 1*N2 + 2*H2O + 0*O2\nreact_A = {'N2': 1, 'H2O': 2, 'O2': 0}\n\n# Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\nM_B = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 3  # g/mol\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Reaction B: NH4NO3 -> 1*N2 + 2*H2O + 0.5*O2\nreact_B = {'N2': 1, 'H2O': 2, 'O2': 0.5}\n\ncandidates = {\n    'A': {'formula': 'NH4NO2', 'M': M_A, 'atoms': atoms_A, 'reaction': react_A},\n    'B': {'formula': 'NH4NO3', 'M': M_B, 'atoms': atoms_B, 'reaction': react_B}\n}\n\n# --- Verification ---\n# Constraint 1: Equimolar mixture must produce the observed moles of products.\n# We can solve for 'n' (moles of each salt) from any of the products.\n# Let's use O2, as it only comes from salt B.\n# moles_O2_exp = n * react_B['O2']\nn_from_O2 = moles_O2_exp / candidates['B']['reaction']['O2']\nprint(f\"Calculated moles of each salt (n) from O2: {n_from_O2:.4f}\")\n\n# Now, check if this 'n' is consistent with the other products.\n# Total moles = n * (moles from A) + n * (moles from B)\nmoles_H2O_calc = n_from_O2 * (candidates['A']['reaction']['H2O'] + candidates['B']['reaction']['H2O'])\nmoles_N2_calc = n_from_O2 * (candidates['A']['reaction']['N2'] + candidates['B']['reaction']['N2'])\n\n# Constraint 2: Product mole consistency\npass_H2O = math.isclose(moles_H2O_calc, moles_H2O_exp, rel_tol=1e-3)\npass_N2 = math.isclose(moles_N2_calc, moles_N2_exp, rel_tol=1e-3)\nprint(f\"Constraint Check (Product Moles):\")\nprint(f\"  H2O: Calculated={moles_H2O_calc:.4f}, Experimental={moles_H2O_exp:.4f} -> {'Pass' if pass_H2O else 'Fail'}\")\nprint(f\"  N2:  Calculated={moles_N2_calc:.4f}, Experimental={moles_N2_exp:.4f} -> {'Pass' if pass_N2 else 'Fail'}\")\n\n# Constraint 3: Total mass consistency\n# Total mass = n * M_A + n * M_B\ntotal_mass_calc = n_from_O2 * (candidates['A']['M'] + candidates['B']['M'])\npass_mass = math.isclose(total_mass_calc, initial_mass, rel_tol=1e-3)\nprint(f\"Constraint Check (Total Mass):\")\nprint(f\"  Mass: Calculated={total_mass_calc:.2f} g, Initial={initial_mass:.2f} g -> {'Pass' if pass_mass else 'Fail'}\")\n\n# --- Final Calculation ---\nif pass_H2O and pass_N2 and pass_mass:\n    total_atoms = candidates['A']['atoms'] + candidates['B']['atoms']\n    print(\"\\nAll constraints passed.
