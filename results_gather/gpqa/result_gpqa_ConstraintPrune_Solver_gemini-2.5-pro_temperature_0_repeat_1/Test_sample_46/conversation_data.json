    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### Initial Analysis & Constraint Generation\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond (DoU=1), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n3.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Constraint 1 (Functional Group - Amine):** The two medium-to-strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2). This prunes any structures with secondary amines/amides (-NH-), tertiary amines, or nitriles.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Functional Group - Carbonyl):** The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region. This value is typical for an α,β-unsaturated or aryl ester. It is too high for a typical amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n4.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Constraint 3 (Ethyl Group):** The combination of a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is a classic signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- is attached to a very electronegative atom, most commonly an oxygen in an ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **Constraint 4 (Aromatic Substitution Pattern):** The two doublets in the aromatic region at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant chemical shift difference between the doublets implies one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Constraint 5 (Amine Protons):** The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is consistent with the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and chemical exchange.\n\n### Candidate Evaluation\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against these constraints.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** `CH3CH2COO-C6H4-NH2`\n    *   This has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm for the `-CO-CH2-` protons, not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** `H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3`\n    *   This structure contains all the required fragments: a primary amine (-NH2), an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** `CH3CH2O-C6H4-CONH2`\n    *   This is a primary amide, which would have a C=O stretch below 1700 cm⁻¹. It is also *meta*-substituted, which would not give two clean doublets in the 1H NMR.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** `CH3CH2O-C6H4-NH-CHO`\n    *   This is a *secondary* amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It also lacks the primary amine protons seen in the NMR.\n\n### Final Check\n\nThe only candidate that survives the initial pruning is **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

    "I have re-evaluated my analysis based on the feedback.\n\n### Step 1: Re-evaluation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe feedback indicated an issue with the DoU calculation. Let's recalculate this value from the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n*   **Formula for DoU:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Values:** C=9, H=11, N=1\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nThe correct Degree of Unsaturation is 5. A non-integer value is not possible for this type of molecule. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (DoU=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, such as a C=O double bond (DoU=1). My initial assessment was correct.\n\n### Step 2: Re-evaluation of Constraints and Candidates\n\nWith the DoU confirmed as 5, I will re-verify the constraints against the candidate structures.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Primary Amine (-NH2):** IR bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ indicate a primary amine. This is also supported by the 2H broad singlet at 4.0 ppm in the NMR. This prunes candidate **D** (secondary amide).\n*   **Constraint 2: Ester Carbonyl (C=O):** The IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an aryl ester, which is conjugated with the benzene ring. This prunes candidate **C** (amide, expected < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Constraint 3: 1,4-Disubstituted Benzene Ring:** The two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) are a classic pattern for a para-substituted ring. This prunes candidate **C** (meta-substituted).\n*   **Constraint 4: Ethyl Group (-CH2CH3):** The NMR signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) are an unambiguous signature for an ethyl group. The downfield shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) confirms it is attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3). This prunes candidate **A**, which has a propionate group and would show a different alkyl NMR pattern.\n\nOnly candidate **B** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) satisfies all constraints simultaneously.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Data for the unknown compound\nunknown_data = {\n    \"Formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n    \"DoU\": 5,\n    \"IR (cm-1)\": [\"3420 & 3325 (primary amine N-H)\", \"1720 (conjugated ester C=O)\"],\n    \"1H NMR (ppm)\": {\n        \"1.20\": \"t, 3H (CH3 of ethyl)\",\n        \"4.0\": \"bs, 2H (NH2)\",\n        \"4.5\": \"q, 2H (O-CH2 of ethyl)\",\n        \"7.0 & 8.0\": \"d, 2H each (para-substituted ring)\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Candidate structures and their expected properties\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": {\n        \"name\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n        \"DoU\": 5,\n        \"IR_NH\": \"Primary amine (Pass)\",\n        \"IR_CO\": \"Aryl ester ~1730 (Pass)\",\n        \"NMR_Aromatic\": \"para (Pass)\",\n        \"NMR_Alkyl\": \"Propionate (Fail, expects -CO-CH2- at ~2.5 ppm)\"\n    },\n    \"B\": {\n        \"name\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n        \"DoU\": 5,\n        \"IR_NH\": \"Primary amine (Pass)\",\n        \"IR_CO\": \"Aryl ester ~1720 (Pass)\",\n        \"NMR_Aromatic\": \"para (Pass)\",\n        \"NMR_Alkyl\": \"Ethyl ester (Pass, expects -O-CH2- at ~4.5 ppm)\"\n    },\n    \"C\": {\n        \"name\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n        \"DoU\": 5,\n        \"IR_NH\": \"Primary amide (Pass)\",\n        \"IR_CO\": \"Amide ~1650 (Fail)\",\n        \"NMR_Aromatic\": \"meta (Fail)\",\n        \"NMR_Alkyl\": \"Ethoxy group (Partial match, but other data fails)\"\n    },\n    \"D\": {\n        \"name\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n        \"DoU\": 5,\n        \"IR_NH\": \"Secondary amide (Fail, expects 1 N-H band)\",\n        \"IR_CO\": \"Amide ~1670 (Fail)\",\n        \"NMR_Aromatic\": \"para (Pass)\",\n        \"NMR_Alkyl\": \"Ethoxy group + Formyl H (Fail, no formyl H)\"\n    }\n}\n\nprint(\"Re-evaluating candidates against constraints:\\n\")\n\nfinal_candidate = None\nfor key, props in candidates.items():\n    print(f\"--- Candidate {key}: {props['name']} ---\")\n    \n    # Constraint 0: Degree of Unsaturation\n    pass_c0 = props['DoU'] == unknown_data['DoU']\n    print(f\"Constraint 0 (DoU): Expected {unknown_data['DoU']}.
