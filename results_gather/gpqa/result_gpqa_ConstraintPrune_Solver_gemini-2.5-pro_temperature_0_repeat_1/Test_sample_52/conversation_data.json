    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem by modeling it as a series of constraints to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n**Analysis of Spectroscopic Data and Initial Constraints**\n\n1.  **Structural Information:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C6H4) as the core structure.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, d & dq):** The splitting pattern of a doublet (d) and a doublet of quartets (dq) is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to a group with no adjacent protons (like the aromatic ring). This fragment accounts for **2 vinyl hydrogens** and one methyl group.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One signal corresponds to the propenyl group's methyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second signal must be from another methyl group, likely part of the ester (e.g., `-COOCH3` or `-OOCCH3`). These two groups account for **6 hydrogens** (3H + 3H).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical negative constraint, ruling out any structure containing a methylene group.\n\n**Applying Constraints to Prune Candidates**\n\nWe can use the information above to establish firm constraints on the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The structure contains:\n    *   An aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DoU\n    *   An ester group (1 C=O double bond) = 1 DoU\n    *   A vinyl group (1 C=C double bond) = 1 DoU\n    The total required DoU is **6**. We can eliminate any formula that does not have a DoU of 6.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Total Hydrogen Count**\n    From the 1H NMR data, we can sum the total number of protons:\n    *   Aromatic protons: 4H\n    *   Vinyl protons: 2H\n    *   Methyl protons: 3H + 3H = 6H\n    *   Methylene protons: 0H\n    The total required number of hydrogens is 4 + 2 + 6 = **12**.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Total Carbon Count**\n    We can also deduce the number of carbons from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6\n    *   Propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`): C3\n    *   Ester group containing a methyl (`-COOCH3` or `-OOCCH3`): C2\n    The total required number of carbons is 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**. This points directly to a formula of C11H12O2.\n\nThe following Python code applies these constraints systematically to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    for element, count in parts:\n        counts[element] = int(count) if count else 1\n    dou = counts.get('C', 0) + 1 - (counts.get('H', 0) / 2)\n    return dou\n\ndef get_atom_count(formula, element):\n    \"\"\"Extracts the number of atoms of a given element from a formula.\"\"\"\n    match = re.search(fr'{element}(\\d+)', formula)\n    return int(match.group(1)) if match else 0\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"Applies constraints to identify the correct chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    candidates = {\n        \"A\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Initial candidates:\", candidates)\n    \n    # --- Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) ---\n    required_dou = 6\n    print(f\"\\n--- Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation must be {required_dou} ---\")\n    passed_c1 = {}\n    for key, formula in candidates.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        if dou == required_dou:\n            status = \"Pass\"\n            passed_c1[key] = formula\n        else:\n            status = \"Fail\"\n        print(f\"Candidate {key} ({formula}): DoU = {dou}.

Status: {status}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal candidate(s):\", final_candidates)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Constraint 1 (DoU = 6)** eliminates A (DoU=7) and D (DoU=5), leaving B (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n2.  **Constraint 2 (H = 12)** eliminates C (H=14), leaving only B (C11H12O2).\n3.  **Constraint 3 (C = 11)** confirms that B (C=11) is the correct choice.\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the constraints derived from the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
