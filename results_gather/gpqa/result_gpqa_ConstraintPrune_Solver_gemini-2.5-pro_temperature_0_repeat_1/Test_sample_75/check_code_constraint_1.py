    # 3. Therefore, in healthy, properly integrating iPSCs, the red signal is not expected yet.
    red_signal_in_healthy_cells = stable_differentiation_in_healthy_cells  # Evaluates to False

    # 4. Apoptosis (detected by TUNEL, green) is a common fate for injected cells that fail to integrate.
    # It is also a normal part of embryonic development. So, a green signal is expected.
    green_signal_is_present = True

    # 5. The key insight: Apoptosis causes widespread cellular dysregulation, which can lead to
    # aberrant activation of normally silent promoters. This is a known biological phenomenon.

    # --- Logical Deduction of the Outcome ---

    # Consider an injected iPSC that is failing to integrate and is undergoing apoptosis.
    # - Will it be green? Yes, it's apoptotic and stained with TUNEL.
    # - Will it be red? Yes, because apoptosis causes aberrant activation of the lineage-specific promoter.
    
    # This leads to the conclusion that the first observable red signal will appear specifically in
    # cells that are also green. This colocalization is the most significant initial finding.
