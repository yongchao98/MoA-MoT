    1. Systematically enumerating all possible microstates of the three-spin system.
    2. Calculating the energy E for each microstate using the given formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].
    3. Grouping the states by their energy level to find the degeneracy of each level.
    4. Constructing the partition function Z = sum(g * exp(-beta * E)) from the calculated degeneracies.
