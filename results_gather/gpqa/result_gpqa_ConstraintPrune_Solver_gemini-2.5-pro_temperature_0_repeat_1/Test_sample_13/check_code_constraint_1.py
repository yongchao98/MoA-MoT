    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to a molecular biology question
    by encoding biological principles into a logical framework.

    The question is:
    ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells
    followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps
    produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used.
    Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

    A) At repeats
    B) At active promoters and enhancers
    C) In the introns of large genes
    D) At random locations in the genome

    # --- Knowledge Base ---
    # This dictionary encodes the key biological principles needed to answer the question.

    # 1. Properties of cross-linkers
    # PFA is a short-range cross-linker, good for direct protein-DNA interactions.
    # DSG is a long-range protein-protein cross-linker. Using it with PFA helps
    # capture larger protein complexes and indirect DNA interactions.
    
    # 2. Interpretation of the experimental observation
    # Observation: Peaks present with PFA-only disappear with PFA+DSG.
    # - At true, specific binding sites (like promoters), adding DSG should STABILIZE or
    #   ENHANCE the signal by capturing the entire protein complex.
    # - Disappearance suggests the original peak might be an artifact. A plausible mechanism
    #   is that stronger cross-linking (with DSG) at "sticky" or aggregation-prone genomic
    #   regions causes the formation of large, insoluble complexes. These oversized,
    #   cross-linked masses can be lost during the centrifugation or washing steps of the
    #   ChIP protocol, leading to a loss of signal.

    # 3. Properties of genomic locations relevant to the options
