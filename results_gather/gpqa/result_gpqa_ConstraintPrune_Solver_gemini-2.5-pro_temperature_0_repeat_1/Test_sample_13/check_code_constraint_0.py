    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the ChIP-seq question by modeling the underlying biological principles.

    The core logic is that a stronger fixation (PFA+DSG) eliminating a peak seen with weaker fixation (PFA)
    implies the peak is not a canonical, stable binding site. Instead, it's likely an artifact or a site
    of epitope masking.
