    # --- Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z ---
    # Constraint: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% (0.1428).
    # The ratio 14.28% is approximately 1/7.
    # Let the formula be C_n H_m. The mass fraction of H is m / (12n + m).
    # If m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7, then 7m ≈ 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m ≈ 12n, or m ≈ 2n.
    # The general formula for Z is C_n H_2n.
    
    # Constraint: Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means it is a saturated compound.
    # A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_2n must be a cycloalkane.
    
    # Constraint: Z is a widely used solvent.
    # The most common and simple cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's verify this candidate.
    z_candidate_formula = {'C': 6, 'H': 12}
    
    # Verify mass fraction for C6H12 using more precise masses.
    h_mass = 1.008
    c_mass = 12.011
    calculated_h_fraction = (z_candidate_formula['H'] * h_mass) / (z_candidate_formula['C'] * c_mass + z_candidate_formula['H'] * h_mass)
    
    # Check if the calculated fraction is close to the target 14.28%.
    if not math.isclose(calculated_h_fraction, 0.1428, rel_tol=0.01):
        return f"Incorrect: The mass fraction of hydrogen for the proposed Z (Cyclohexane, C6H12) is {calculated_h_fraction:.4f}, which does not match the given 14.28%."
    
    Z = z_candidate_formula  # Z is confirmed as {'C': 6, 'H': 12}

    # --- Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y ---
    # Constraint: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.
    # Constraint: Z is a constituent of Y. So, let C = Z = Cyclohexane.
    C = Z
    
    # Constraint: Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.
    # This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (C6H12 -> C6H12) and hydrogenation of D also gives Z.
    # For D to hydrogenate to C6H12, D must have a C6 carbon skeleton.
    
    # Constraint: Y does not decolorize bromine water.
    # This means both C and D are saturated or aromatic.
    # We know C (cyclohexane) is saturated.
    # D must be a C6 compound that is either saturated or aromatic, and is not cyclohexane.
    # The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene, C6H6. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane.
    # Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under these conditions.
    D = {'C': 6, 'H': 6} # Benzene
    
    # Mixture Y is confirmed as {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the reaction and find the total H atoms in Mixture X ---
    # Constraint: Mixture X (A+B) is converted to Mixture Y (C+D) via disproportionation.
    # Reaction: A + B -> C + D
    
    # Constraint: Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z.
    # This implies that both A and B also have a C6 carbon skeleton.
    # Let A be C6H_x and B be C6H_y.
    
    # By the law of conservation of atoms for the reaction A + B -> C + D:
    # C6H_x + C6H_y -> C6H12 + C6H6
    # The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.
    total_h_in_products = C['H'] + D['H']
    total_h_in_reactants_X = total_h_in_products
    
    if total_h_in_reactants_X != 18:
        return f"Internal logic error: Calculation of total H in products is {total_h_in_products}, not 18."

    # The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.
    # This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is 18.
    
    # --- Step 4: Verify consistency with other constraints on X ---
    # Constraint: X decolorizes bromine water -> A and B must be unsaturated.
    # Constraint: No conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.
    # A plausible pair satisfying these is A=Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B=1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).
    # - Total H = 10 + 8 = 18. Consistent.
    # - Both are unsaturated. Consistent.
    # - Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-Cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (not conjugated). Consistent.
    # - Hydrogenation of both gives cyclohexane. Consistent.
    # The existence of such a pair confirms the logic is sound.
    
    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # The calculated total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is 18.
    # The provided answer is A, which corresponds to 18.
