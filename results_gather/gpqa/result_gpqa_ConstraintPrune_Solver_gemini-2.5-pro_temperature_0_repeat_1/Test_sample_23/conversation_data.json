    "Here is the step-by-step deduction based on the provided constraints.\n\n**Constraint 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₙHₘ is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n*   14.28% is approximately 1/7.\n*   Setting `m / (12n + m) = 1/7` gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n*   The molecular formula of Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n*   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**Constraint 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of Y. Let's set C = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of both C and D gives only Z. Hydrogenating C (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenating D must also give cyclohexane, so D must have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n*   Since D is not cyclohexane (it's a different liquid) and it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound. The only C₆ aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene (C₆H₆) does indeed yield cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**Constraint 3: Analyze the reaction and identify components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   The conversion of X to Y is a disproportionation reaction where A and B react in a 1:1 molar ratio to form C and D.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → C + D\n*   Substituting the identities of C and D: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X (A and B) gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that A and B both have a C₆ ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ.\n*   The reaction is: C₆Hₓ + C₆Hᵧ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n*   Total H atoms in reactants = x + y.\n*   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, x + y = 18.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum (x + y).\n\nThe remaining constraints (decolorizing bromine water, no conjugated bonds) can be used to verify that such liquids A and B exist. For example, A could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B could be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Here, x=10 and y=8, so x+y=18. Both decolorize bromine water, and neither has conjugated double bonds. This confirms our solution is chemically plausible.\n\n```python\n# Define known atomic masses\nH_mass = 1.008\nC_mass = 12.011\n\n# Constraint 1: Identify hydrocarbon Z\nprint(\"--- Constraint 1: Identify Z ---\")\n# Z is a hydrocarbon C_n H_m with H mass % = 14.28% (or 0.1428)\n# m*H_mass / (n*C_mass + m*H_mass) = 0.1428\n# Let's use the approximation 14.28% = 1/7\n# m / (12n + m) = 1/7  => 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n\n# So the formula is C_n H_2n.\n# Z is saturated, so it must be a cycloalkane.\n# Z is a common solvent, so cyclohexane (C6H12) is the most likely candidate.\nn_Z, m_Z = 6, 12\nZ_formula = f\"C{n_Z}H{m_Z}\"\nZ_H_fraction = (m_Z * H_mass) / (n_Z * C_mass + m_Z * H_mass)\nprint(f\"Candidate for Z: Cyclohexane ({Z_formula})\")\nprint(f\"Calculated H mass fraction for {Z_formula}: {Z_H_fraction:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Target H mass fraction: 0.1428\")\n# The value 0.1437 is very close to 0.1428, confirming the C_n H_2n ratio.\nprint(\"Constraint 1 Pass/Fail: Pass\\n\")\n\n# Constraint 2: Identify mixture Y (C and D)\nprint(\"--- Constraint 2: Identify Y ---\")\n# Y is an equimolar mixture of C and D.

    "Answering based on the verified reasoning:\n\nThe problem is solved by systematically identifying the chemical species involved.\n\n1.  **Hydrocarbon Z:** The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28% ≈ 1/7) in a saturated hydrocarbon implies a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ, which corresponds to a cycloalkane. Given that Z is a common solvent, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (cyclohexane). The other liquid in Y also hydrogenates to Z, meaning it has a C₆ skeleton. Since mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, this second liquid must be saturated or aromatic. As it's not cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Mixture X:** Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   Reaction: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
