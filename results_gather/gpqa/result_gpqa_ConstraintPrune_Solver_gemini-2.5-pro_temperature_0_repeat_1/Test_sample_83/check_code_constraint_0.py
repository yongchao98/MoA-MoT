    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to a question about

    # --- Analysis of Each Option ---

    # A) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation
    #    - A rational function R(z) is decomposed into a sum of simpler fractions:
    #      R(z) = c_0 + Σ [c_i / (z - p_i)]
    #    - Applying this to a matrix A to compute y = R(A)v results in:
    #      y = c_0*v + Σ [c_i * (A - p_i*I)^-1 * v]
    #    - Each term `x_i = (A - p_i*I)^-1 * v` is an independent linear system solve.
    #    - These independent solves can be distributed across multiple processors.

        "satisfies_constraint_1": True,
        "satisfies_constraint_2": True,
        "reasoning": "This is the correct mechanism. Partial fraction decomposition directly breaks the single, large matrix problem into a sum of smaller, independent linear systems. These systems can be solved in parallel, which is the essence of converting the sequential algorithm."
    }

    # B) Complex roots of fractional approximation
    #    - The roots (poles) of the denominator are part of the approximation.
    #    - However, their existence or nature (being complex) is a property, not the
    #      decomposition mechanism itself. The parallel structure comes from the
    #      summation over these roots, which is given by partial fractions.
    options_analysis["B"] = {
        "satisfies_constraint_1": True,
        "satisfies_constraint_2": False,
        "reasoning": "This is a property of the approximation, but it is not the factor that enables parallelism. The parallel structure is created by the summation over the roots (partial fraction expansion), not the mere existence of the roots."
    }

    # C) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions
    #    - This is a property of the original PDE, not the numerical approximation method
    #      for the matrix exponential.
    #    - Nonlocal conditions typically create dense matrices and global data dependencies,
    #      which makes parallelization harder, not easier.
    options_analysis["C"] = {
        "satisfies_constraint_1": False,
        "satisfies_constraint_2": False,
        "reasoning": "This relates to the physics problem (the PDE), not the numerical technique in question. Furthermore, it generally hinders, rather than helps, parallelization."
    }

    # D) Stability analysis
    #    - Stability is a necessary condition for any numerical algorithm to be valid,
    #      whether it is sequential or parallel.
    #    - It ensures the method is usable but does not provide a mechanism for
    #      decomposing the problem into parallel tasks.
