    "Here is the step-by-step solution modeling the problem as a set of constraints.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid and the resulting pH to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³.\n\nThe core chemical reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis process involves two main aspects that we can model as constraints:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Constraint:** We must add enough acid to react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Equilibrium/pH Constraint:** After the reaction, the amount of *excess* acid must result in the specified final pH in the 100 cm³ solution.\n\nA candidate solution (a pair of volume and pH) must satisfy both constraints to be valid. We will test each option against these constraints.\n\nFirst, we need some fundamental values. The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is required.\n*   Molar Mass Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the moles of H⁺ required for the reaction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Model Setup ---\n# Knowns from the problem statement\nmass_feoh3_g = 0.1  # grams\ntotal_volume_cm3 = 100.0\ntotal_volume_L = total_volume_cm3 / 1000.0  # Liters\nacid_molarity_M = 0.1  # mol/L\n\n# Chemical constants\nmolar_mass_feoh3_g_mol = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)\n\n# Candidates from the options\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": {\"ph\": 4.94, \"vol_cm3\": 20.40},\n    \"B\": {\"ph\": 3.16, \"vol_cm3\": 32.14},\n    \"C\": {\"ph\": 2.04, \"vol_cm3\": 28.05},\n    \"D\": {\"ph\": 2.69, \"vol_cm3\": 30.09},\n}\n\n# --- Foundational Calculations ---\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3_g / molar_mass_feoh3_g_mol\n\n# Stoichiometric moles of H+ required for the reaction:\n# Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe(3+) + 3H2O\nmoles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\nprint(f\"--- Initial Calculations ---\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3: {molar_mass_feoh3_g_mol:.3f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve: {moles_feoh3:.6f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Stoichiometric moles of H+ needed for reaction: {moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Constraint Application ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Applying Constraints to Candidates ---\")\nfinal_candidates = []\n\nfor name, data in candidates.items():\n    print(f\"\\nTesting Candidate {name}: pH={data['ph']}, Volume={data['vol_cm3']} cm3\")\n    vol_acid_cm3 = data['vol_cm3']\n    vol_acid_L = vol_acid_cm3 / 1000.0\n    ph_candidate = data['ph']\n    \n    moles_h_added = vol_acid_L * acid_molarity_M\n\n    # --- Constraint 1: Stoichiometric Sufficiency ---\n    # The moles of acid added must be greater than or equal to the moles needed for the reaction.\n    # This is the first pruning step.\n    pass_c1 = moles_h_added >= moles_h_reacted\n    print(f\"Constraint 1 (Stoichiometric Sufficiency):\")\n    print(f\"  Moles H+ added from {vol_acid_cm3} cm3: {moles_h_added:.6f} mol\")\n    print(f\"  Pass/Fail: {'PASS' if pass_c1 else 'FAIL'}\")\n\n    if not pass_c1:\n        continue # Prune this candidate as it fails the most basic requirement.\n\n    # --- Constraint 2: pH Consistency ---\n    # The pH calculated from the excess acid must match the candidate's pH.\n    moles_h_free = moles_h_added - moles_h_reacted\n    conc_h_final = moles_h_free / total_volume_L\n    \n    # pH is undefined for non-positive concentrations\n    if conc_h_final <= 0:\n        ph_calculated = float('inf')\n    else:\n        ph_calculated = -math.log10(conc_h_final)\n\n    # Compare calculated pH with candidate pH (allowing for small rounding tolerance)\n    pass_c2 = math.isclose(ph_calculated, ph_candidate, rel_tol=1e-2)\n    \n    print(f\"Constraint 2 (pH Consistency):\")\n    print(f\"  Calculated pH from excess H+: {ph_calculated:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"  Candidate pH: {ph_candidate:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"  Pass/Fail: {'PASS' if pass_c2 else 'FAIL'}\")\n\n    if pass_c2:\n        final_candidates.append(name)\n\nprint(\"\\n----------------------------------------\")\nprint(\"Final check:\")\nprint(f\"Candidate A: Fails Constraint 1.

The volume of acid is sufficient to react with all the Fe(OH)₃, and the remaining excess H⁺ ions produce a pH that matches the value given in the option.\n\n<<<D>>>",
