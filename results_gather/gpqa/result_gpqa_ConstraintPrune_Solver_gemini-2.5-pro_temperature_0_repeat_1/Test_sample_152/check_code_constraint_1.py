    # The reaction adds a '3-oxobutyl' group (-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3) to the Michael donor.

    # Therefore, the starting Michael donor (Reactant C) must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, as its C2 position is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate.
    # The alternative, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is an unstable tautomer and an incorrect name for the stable enol form (3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one). The reactant is the stable dione.
