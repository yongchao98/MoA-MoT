    "The user wants to determine the number of products from the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** The starting material is \"racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene\". This means we have a mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's call them **R** and **S**.\n2.  **Identify Reaction:** The Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis. Since there is only one type of alkene starting material (in two stereoisomeric forms), it will be a self-metathesis reaction. The general reaction is `2 * (CH2=CH-R*) -> CH2=CH2 + R*-CH=CH-R*`. We are asked to exclude ethene (`CH2=CH2`).\n3.  **Identify Possible Pairings:** In a racemic mixture, three reaction pairings are possible:\n    *   An **R** molecule reacts with another **R** molecule (**R+R**).\n    *   An **S** molecule reacts with another **S** molecule (**S+S**).\n    *   An **R** molecule reacts with an **S** molecule (**R+S**). The **S+R** pairing is identical.\n4.  **Analyze Product Structure:** The product of interest is `R*-CH=CH-R*`, where `R*` is the chiral `CH(CH3)CH2CH3` group. The product's IUPAC name is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n5.  **Analyze Product Stereochemistry:** The product has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a new double bond (C4=C5) that can have E or Z geometry. We must analyze the stereoisomers formed from each pairing.\n    *   **R+R pairing:** Forms (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This can exist as E and Z isomers. These are two distinct products.\n    *   **S+S pairing:** Forms (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This can also exist as E and Z isomers. These two products are the enantiomers of the products from the R+R reaction.\n    *   **R+S pairing:** Forms (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This is a *meso* compound because the two chiral centers have opposite configurations in a symmetric molecule. It can exist as E and Z isomers. These are two distinct *meso* products (which are diastereomers of each other and of the chiral products).\n6.  **Count Unique Products:** We sum the distinct products from all pairings.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\nBy breaking down the problem by reaction pairings (**R+R**, **S+S**, **R+S**), we can systematically analyze the stereochemical outcome of each path. This avoids the confusion of trying to enumerate all possible stereoisomers at once. The key pruning step is recognizing that the **R+S** cross-reaction leads to *meso* compounds, while the **R+R** and **S+S** homo-reactions lead to enantiomeric pairs.\n\n```python\ndef solve_metathesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene as a set of constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_products = set()\n\n    # Constraint 1: Define the racemic starting materials\n    reactants = ['(R)-3-methylpent-1-ene', '(S)-3-methylpent-1-ene']\n    print(\"--- Constraint 1: Identify Reactants ---\")\n    print(f\"Starting material is a racemic mixture of: {reactants}\")\n    constraint_1_pass = len(reactants) == 2\n    print(f\"Pass/Fail: {'Pass' if constraint_1_pass else 'Fail'}\\n\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: Define the possible reaction pairings for self-metathesis\n    pairings = [('R', 'R'), ('S', 'S'), ('R', 'S')]\n    print(\"--- Constraint 2: Identify Reaction Pairings ---\")\n    print(f\"Possible pairings for self-metathesis: {pairings}\")\n    constraint_2_pass = len(pairings) == 3\n    print(f\"Pass/Fail: {'Pass' if constraint_2_pass else 'Fail'}\\n\")\n\n    # Constraint 3: Analyze products from the (R)+(R) pairing\n    print(\"--- Constraint 3: Analyze Products from (R)+(R) Pairing ---\")\n    # Product has (3R, 6R) stereochemistry.
