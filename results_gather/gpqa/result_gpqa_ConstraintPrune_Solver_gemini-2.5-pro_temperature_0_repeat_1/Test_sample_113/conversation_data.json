    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem based on chemical constraints.\n\n**Constraint Modeling and Pruning**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This reaction is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, forming a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl, creating an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent `A` must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   **Constraint:** Reagent `A` must be an acid.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   `H3O+`: Represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (e.g., HCl, H₂SO₄). This is a standard and effective proton source for this reaction.\n        *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite. This reagent also adds to ketones but forms a different product (a bisulfite adduct). It is not the correct reagent to facilitate cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Pruning:** Based on this constraint, we can eliminate options B and C, as they propose `A = NaHSO3`. We are left with options A and D.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Constraint:** Reagent `B` must be a strong acid or a strong base to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B (from remaining candidates A and D):**\n        *   `CH3COOH` (from option A): Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   `HCl` (from option D): Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. It is a standard reagent used for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n    *   **Pruning:** Based on this constraint, `HCl` is the suitable reagent. This eliminates option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only remaining candidate is option D, which satisfies both constraints.\n*   `A = H3O+` is the correct proton source for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   `B = HCl` is the correct strong acid catalyst for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Selects the suitable reagents for the given reactions by applying chemical constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"A\": \"H3O+\", \"B\": \"CH3COOH\"},\n        \"B\": {\"A\": \"NaHSO3\", \"B\": \"CH3COOH\"},\n        \"C\": {\"A\": \"NaHSO3\", \"B\": \"HCl\"},\n        \"D\": {\"A\": \"H3O+\", \"B\": \"HCl\"},\n    }\n\n    candidates = []\n\n    print(\"--- Applying Constraints ---\")\n\n    for name, reagents in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Candidate: {name}\")\n        \n        # Constraint 1: Reagent A must be a proton source (acid) for cyanohydrin formation.\n        # H3O+ is a valid acid source.
