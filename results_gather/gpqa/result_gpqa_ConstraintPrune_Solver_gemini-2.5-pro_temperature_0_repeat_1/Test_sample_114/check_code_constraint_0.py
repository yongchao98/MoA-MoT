    # We can work in natural units where the rest mass of the electron (m_e) and
    # the speed of light (c) are both equal to 1. The final angle is a dimensionless
    # quantity and does not depend on the choice of units.

    # --- Constraint 1: Conservation of Energy ---
    # The total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.
    # E_particle = gamma * m_e * c^2
    # In our units (m_e=1, c=1):
    E_initial = gamma_e + gamma_p  # E_initial = 4 + 2 = 6

    # By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final

    # --- Constraint 2: Conservation of Momentum ---
    # For a photon, momentum p = E/c. In our units, p_photon = E_photon.
    p_photon = E_photon

    # Y-Momentum:
    # The initial y-momentum is 0 as both particles move horizontally.
    # The final y-momentum is p_ph*sin(theta_1) + p_ph*sin(theta_2).
    # For this to be 0, sin(theta_1) = -sin(theta_2), which means theta_1 = -theta_2.
    # Let's call the positive angle 'theta'. The total angle between photons is 2*theta.
    # This confirms the symmetric trajectory described in the problem.

    # X-Momentum:
    # The momentum of a massive particle is p = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * m_e * c.
    # In our units:
    p_electron_x = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1)  # Moves in +x direction
    p_positron_x = -math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1) # Moves in -x direction
    
    p_initial_x = p_electron_x + p_positron_x
    # p_initial_x = sqrt(4^2 - 1) - sqrt(2^2 - 1) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

    # The final x-momentum is the sum of the x-components of the photon momenta.
    # p_final_x = p_photon*cos(theta) + p_photon*cos(-theta) = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)
    
    # By conservation of x-momentum, p_initial_x = p_final_x
    # sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)
