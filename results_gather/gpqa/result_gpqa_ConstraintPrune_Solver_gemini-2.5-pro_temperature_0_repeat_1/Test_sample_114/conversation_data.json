    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution by modeling the problem as a set of physical constraints.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\nThe core of this problem is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity. We will apply these laws as constraints to determine the final state of the system (the angle between the photons) from its initial state.\n\n**Initial State:**\n*   Electron: Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, moving in the +x direction.\n*   Positron: Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, moving in the -x direction.\n*   The rest mass of an electron and a positron is the same, denoted `m_e`.\n\n**Final State:**\n*   Two photons of equal energy, `E_ph`.\n*   Photon 1: Moves at an angle `θ_1` to the x-axis (upper-right, so `θ_1 > 0`).\n*   Photon 2: Moves at an angle `θ_2` to the x-axis (lower-right, so `θ_2 < 0`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Constraint - Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**: The energy of a particle is `E = γ * m_e * c^2`.\n    `E_initial = E_electron + E_positron = (γ_e * m_e * c^2) + (γ_p * m_e * c^2) = (4 + 2) * m_e * c^2 = 6 * m_e * c^2`.\n*   **Final Energy (`E_final`)**: The energy of the two photons. Since they have equal energy `E_ph`:\n    `E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph`.\n*   **Applying the constraint**: `E_initial = E_final`\n    `6 * m_e * c^2 = 2 * E_ph`\n    This gives us the energy of each photon: `E_ph = 3 * m_e * c^2`.\n\nThis first constraint has pruned the infinite possibilities for photon energies down to a single value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Constraint - Conservation of Momentum\n\nThe total momentum vector before the collision must equal the total momentum vector after. We analyze the components along the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes.\n\n**A) Y-Momentum (Transverse)**\n\n*   **Initial Y-Momentum**: Both particles move horizontally, so the initial y-momentum is `0`.\n*   **Final Y-Momentum**: For a photon, momentum `p = E / c`. The y-component of momentum for the two photons is `p_ph * sin(θ_1) + p_ph * sin(θ_2)`.\n*   **Applying the constraint**:\n    `0 = p_ph * sin(θ_1) + p_ph * sin(θ_2)`\n    `sin(θ_1) = -sin(θ_2)`\n    Since one photon is upper-right (`θ_1 > 0`) and the other is lower-right (`θ_2 < 0`), this implies their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis: `θ_1 = -θ_2`. Let's call the positive angle `θ`.\n\nThis constraint establishes the symmetry of the photon paths, further reducing the search space.\n\n**B) X-Momentum (Longitudinal)**\n\n*   **Initial X-Momentum**: The momentum of a particle is `p = sqrt(γ^2 - 1) * m_e * c`.\n    *   Electron: `p_e = sqrt(4^2 - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`.\n    *   Positron: `p_p = -sqrt(2^2 - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c` (negative sign for -x direction).\n    *   Total: `p_initial_x = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`.\n*   **Final X-Momentum**: The momentum of each photon is `p_ph = E_ph / c = (3 * m_e * c^2) / c = 3 * m_e * c`.\n    *   Total: `p_final_x = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`.\n*   **Applying the constraint**: `p_initial_x = p_final_x`\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nThis final constraint allows us to solve for the angle `θ`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculation and Final Answer\n\nWe now calculate the angle `θ` and then the total angle between the photons, which is `2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the angle between two photons from an electron-positron annihilation\n    based on conservation laws.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial conditions\n    gamma_e = 4  # Lorentz factor of electron\n    gamma_p = 2  # Lorentz factor of positron\n\n    # --- Constraint 1: Conservation of Energy ---\n    # E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m_e * c^2 = 6 * m_e * c^2\n    # E_final = 2 * E_photon\n    # E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p) / 2 * m_e * c^2\n    # We work with factors of m_e*c^2 or m_e*c, which cancel out.\n    e_photon_factor = (gamma_e + gamma_p) / 2\n    p_photon_factor = e_photon_factor  # Since p = E/c for a photon\n    \n    print(\"--- Constraint 1: Energy Conservation ---\")\n    print(f\"Energy of each photon is {e_photon_factor} * m_e*c^2.\")\n    print(\"Final Pass/Fail: Pass\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Constraint 2: Y-Momentum Conservation ---\n    # p_initial_y = 0\n    # p_final_y = p_ph*sin(theta1) + p_ph*sin(theta2) = 0\n    # This implies theta1 = -theta2, confirming trajectory symmetry.\n    print(\"--- Constraint 2: Y-Momentum Conservation ---\")\n    print(\"Initial y-momentum is 0, forcing final y-momentum to be 0.\")\n    print(\"This requires the photon angles to be symmetric: theta_1 = -theta_2.\")\n    print(\"Final Pass/Fail: Pass\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Constraint 3: X-Momentum Conservation ---\n    # p_initial_x = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m_e*c\n    p_initial_x_factor = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\n    \n    # p_final_x = p_photon*cos(theta) + p_photon*cos(-theta) = 2*p_photon*cos(theta)\n    # p_initial_x_factor = 2 * p_photon_factor * cos(theta)\n    cos_theta = p_initial_x_factor / (2 * p_photon_factor)\n    \n    # Calculate the angle\n    theta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n    theta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n    \n    # The angle between the photons is 2*theta\n    angle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\n    print(\"--- Constraint 3: X-Momentum Conservation ---\")\n    print(f\"Derived cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 = {cos_theta:.5f}\")\n    print(f\"This gives a half-angle theta = {theta_deg:.2f} degrees.\")\n    print(\"Final Pass/Fail: Pass\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"\\nCandidate(s):\")\n    print(f\"The calculated angle between the photons is 2 * theta = {angle_between_photons:.2f} degrees.\")\n\nsolve_annihilation_angle()\n```\n\nThe calculation shows the angle between the photons is approximately 138.19 degrees.
