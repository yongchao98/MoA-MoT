    # Constraint 1 (Reaction Type): Intramolecular. Pass.
    # Constraint 2 (Skeleton): Linker is C6-C7-C8-C9 (4 atoms). Correct for bicyclo[4.4.0]. Pass.
    # Constraint 3 (Double Bond): Diene is C2=C3-C4=C5. Product double bond is at C3-C4. Pass.
    # Constraint 4 (Substituents): Ester on C2, Propyl on C11. Reaction connects C2 and C11, making them adjacent.
    #   IUPAC naming gives the ester C1 and the propyl C2. This matches the target name. Pass.
