    Analyzes potential starting materials for the synthesis of
    methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate.

    The target molecule has key features:
    1.  A bicyclo[4.4.0]decane (decalin) skeleton, suggesting an intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA).
    2.  A single double bond between C3 and C4.
    3.  Substituents (-COOCH3 and -propyl) on saturated carbons C1 and C2, adjacent to each other.
