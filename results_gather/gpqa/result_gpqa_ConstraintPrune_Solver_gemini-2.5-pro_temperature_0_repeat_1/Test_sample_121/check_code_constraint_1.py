    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer (C, which is 8)
    for the number of distinct 1H NMR signals in the final product (4).

    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1.  Deduce the structure of the final product from the reaction sequence.
    2.  Analyze the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.
    3.  Count the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments, paying
        special attention to diastereotopicity caused by chiral centers.

    # Step 1: Deduce the final structure.
    # Rxn 1: Acetic acid -> Bromoacetic acid
    # Rxn 2: Bromoacetic acid -> Ethyl bromoacetate
    # Rxn 3: Ethyl bromoacetate -> Ethyl cyanoacetate
    # Rxn 4: 2 x Ethyl cyanoacetate + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Double alkylation
    # Final Product (4): Diethyl 2,6-dicyanoheptanedioate
    # Structure: (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt)
    # This molecule is symmetrical and has two chiral centers at the alpha-carbons.
