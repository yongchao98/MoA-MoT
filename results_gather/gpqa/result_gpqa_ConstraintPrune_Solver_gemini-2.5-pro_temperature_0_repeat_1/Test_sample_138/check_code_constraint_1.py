    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the chemistry question.

    The logic is based on two chemical principles for alpha-oxidation of ketones:
    1. The starting material must be a ketone.
    2. The ketone must have an appropriate structure (an adjacent CH2 group)
       that can be oxidized to form the specific diketone product.
