    # --- Verification Step 1: Identify the Starting Material ---
    # The combination of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a -NH2 group,
    # and a -CH2-CHO fragment that fits the formula C8H9NO points to
    # 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
    # DBE = C+1-H/2+N/2 = 8+1-9/2+1/2 = 5. (Benzene ring=4, C=O=1). This is consistent.

    # --- Verification Step 2: Identify the Intermediate Product ---
    # Reagents 1 & 2: Diazotization of the primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis.
    # The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to an -OH group.
    # 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde -> 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde
    derived_intermediate = "4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde"

    # --- Verification Step 3: Identify the Final Product ---
    # Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat on the intermediate.
    # 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde and alpha-protons.
    # These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation.
    # The base (KOH) catalyzes the reaction, and "Heat" promotes the final
    # dehydration step to form a stable, conjugated system.
    # Addition Product (Option D): 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
    # Condensation Product (Option B): 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
    # The presence of "Heat" makes the condensation product the expected final product.
