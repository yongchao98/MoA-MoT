    # Step 1: Define the problem and derive the correct answer based on chemical principles.
    
    # Analysis of the starting material (C8H9NO) from NMR:
    # - Degrees of Unsaturation = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. This suggests a benzene ring (4 DoU) and a carbonyl group (1 DoU).
    # - NMR signals analysis:
    #   - 9.72 (t, 1H): Aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a CH2 group (n+1=3 -> n=2).
    #   - 3.66 (d, 2H): Methylene protons (-CH2-) coupled to one proton (the aldehyde H, n+1=2 -> n=1). This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.
    #   - 6.98 (d, 2H) & 6.51 (d, 2H): A classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.
    #   - 6.27 (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2 protons, consistent with a primary amine (-NH2) group.
    # - Conclusion for starting material: The structure that fits all data is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
    
    # Analysis of the reaction sequence:
    # 1. NaNO2 + HCl, then 2. H2O: This is a standard diazotization of a primary aromatic amine, followed by hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. The -NH2 group is converted to an -OH group.
    #    - Intermediate product: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.
    # 3. aq. KOH, Heat: This reagent combination with an aldehyde that has alpha-protons (like 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) is the classic condition for an aldol condensation.
    #    - The base (KOH) catalyzes the formation of an aldol addition product. This intermediate would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D).
    #    - The "Heat" in the reaction conditions promotes the dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) from this addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system.
    #    - The final product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.

    # Step 2: Match the derived final product with the given options.
