    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the electrochemistry question.

    # Principle 1: Thermodynamics of Oxygen as an Oxidant
    # The standard reduction potential (E째) measures the tendency of a chemical species to be reduced.
    # A higher E째 means a stronger oxidizing agent.
    # E째 for O2 in acidic solution (O2 + 4H+ + 4e- -> 2H2O) is +1.23 V.
    # E째 for O2 in basic solution (O2 + 2H2O + 4e- -> 4OH-) is +0.40 V.
    # Since +0.40 V < +1.23 V, oxygen is thermodynamically a WEAKER oxidant in basic solution.

    # Principle 2: Kinetics of Oxygen Reduction
    # The reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) is a multi-electron process that requires
    # breaking a strong O=O double bond. This results in a high activation energy barrier.
    # Consequently, the reaction is known to be kinetically sluggish, or SLOW.
