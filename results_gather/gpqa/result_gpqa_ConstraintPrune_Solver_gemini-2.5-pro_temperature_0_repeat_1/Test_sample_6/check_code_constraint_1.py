    # --- Physics Calculation ---

    # The threshold condition for pair production (gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-)
    # is derived from the invariance of the four-momentum squared, s.
    # s = (p_gamma + p_cmb)^2 = (p_e+ + p_e-)^2
    # In the center-of-mass frame, at threshold, the total energy is the rest mass of the products, E_cm = 2 * m_e * c^2.
    # So, s = (2 * m_e * c^2)^2.
    # In the lab frame, for a head-on collision (which gives the minimum threshold energy for the high-energy photon),
    # s = 4 * E_gamma * E_cmb.
    # Equating the two expressions for s gives the threshold condition:
    # 4 * E_gamma * E_cmb = 4 * (m_e*c^2)^2
    # E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_cmb

    # Calculate the threshold energy in eV using the defined constants.
    calculated_e_gamma_ev = (m_e_ev**2) / e_cmb_ev
