    "The user wants to find the total energy of a specific Lithium nucleus moving at a relativistic speed.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Identify the Particle (Nucleus X):**\n    *   The element is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n    *   The mass number (A) is Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Identify the Kinematics:**\n    *   The speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   Since the speed is close to c, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physics Equation:**\n    *   The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation: E = γ * E₀\n    *   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²), where m₀ is the rest mass.\n    *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### Pruning and Calculation Strategy\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** This value is determined solely by the speed and is a strong, fixed constraint.\n    *   v/c = 0.96\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784 = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):** The rest energy of the $^6$Li nucleus can be approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. This is a common simplification in physics problems that ignores the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton (m_p * c²) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of a neutron (m_n * c²) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n    *   E₀ for $^6$Li ≈ (3 * 938.272 MeV) + (3 * 939.565 MeV)\n    *   E₀ ≈ 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV = 5633.511 MeV ≈ 5.6335 GeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):** Now, combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n    *   E = γ * E₀ ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV ≈ 20.1196 GeV\n\n4.  **Compare with Candidates:**\n    *   A) 21.419 GeV\n    *   B) 20.132 GeV\n    *   C) 18.475 GeV\n    *   D) 23.069 GeV\n    *   The calculated value of ~20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (~0.06%) can be attributed to the precise values of the physical constants used. This allows us to prune the other options.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Setup: Define constants and candidates ---\n# Physical constants (in MeV for energy)\nMASS_PROTON_MEV = 938.272088\nMASS_NEUTRON_MEV = 939.565420\n# Problem parameters\nSPEED_RATIO = 0.96  # v/c\nNUM_PROTONS = 3\nNUM_NEUTRONS = 3\n# Candidate answers in GeV\nCANDIDATES = {\n    \"A\": 21.419,\n    \"B\": 20.132,\n    \"C\": 18.475,\n    \"D\": 23.069,\n}\nprint(\"--- Initial Setup ---\")\nprint(f\"Nucleus: Li-6 ({NUM_PROTONS} protons, {NUM_NEUTRONS} neutrons)\")\nprint(f\"Speed: {SPEED_RATIO}c\")\nprint(f\"Candidates (GeV): {CANDIDATES}\\n\")\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Calculate Lorentz Factor (gamma) ---\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - SPEED_RATIO**2)\nprint(\"--- Constraint 1: Lorentz Factor ---\")\nprint(f\"Calculated gamma (γ): {gamma:.6f}\")\n# All candidates are for a relativistic particle, so this constraint doesn't prune them alone.\nprint(\"Status: All candidates are plausible relativistic energies.\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Constraint 2: Calculate Rest Energy (E0) ---\n# We model the rest energy by summing the masses of constituent nucleons.\n# This is a common simplification that ignores nuclear binding energy.\nrest_energy_mev = (NUM_PROTONS * MASS_PROTON_MEV) + (NUM_NEUTRONS * MASS_NEUTRON_MEV)\nrest_energy_gev = rest_energy_mev / 1000.0\nprint(\"--- Constraint 2: Rest Energy ---\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Rest Energy (E₀) from constituents: {rest_energy_gev:.6f} GeV\")\n# This constraint helps determine the expected total energy.\nprint(\"Status: This value will be used to calculate the final expected energy.\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Constraint 3: Calculate Total Energy (E = gamma * E0) and Prune ---\nexpected_energy_gev = gamma * rest_energy_gev\nprint(\"--- Constraint 3: Total Energy Calculation and Final Check ---\")\nprint(f\"Expected Total Energy (E = γ * E₀): {expected_energy_gev:.6f} GeV\\n\")\n\n# Find the best candidate\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest_candidate = None\nfor label, value in CANDIDATES.items():\n    diff = abs(value - expected_energy_gev)\n    if diff < min_diff:\n        min_diff = diff\n        best_candidate = label\n\n# Print pass/fail for each candidate based on being the closest match\nprint(\"Candidate Check:\")\nfor label, value in CANDIDATES.items():\n    status = \"Pass\" if label == best_candidate else \"Fail\"\n    print(f\"  Candidate {label} ({value} GeV): {status}\")\n\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
