    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the RHIC energy problem.
    
    The problem asks for the total energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c.
    The solution involves:
    1. Identifying the nucleus composition (3 protons, 3 neutrons).
    2. Calculating the Lorentz factor (gamma) for the given speed.
    3. Calculating the rest energy of the nucleus. The standard approximation for such problems
       is to sum the rest energies of the constituent protons and neutrons, ignoring binding energy.
    4. Calculating the total relativistic energy using E = gamma * E_rest.
    5. Comparing the calculated energy with the provided options to find the best match.
