    # --- Derivation of Correct Products based on Chemical Principles ---

    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Rule 1 (Carbocation): The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, making it more stable than the tertiary carbocation at C3. The -OH at C4 leaves.
    # Rule 2 (Migration): A group from C3 (methyl or ethyl) migrates to C4. The options provided only consider methyl migration.
    # Expected Product A: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    expected_product_A = "3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Rule 1 (Carbocation): Both potential carbocations (at C2 and C3) are tertiary and benzylic. However, the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is more electron-donating than the phenyl group, so it better stabilizes the carbocation at C3. The -OH at C3 leaves.
    # Rule 2 (Migration): A group from C2 (phenyl or methyl) migrates to C3. Phenyl has a much higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # Expected Product B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    expected_product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Rule 1 (Carbocation): The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two strongly electron-donating 4-methoxyphenyl groups, making it far more stable than the carbocation at C2 (stabilized by one 4-methoxyphenyl and one phenyl group). The -OH at C1 leaves.
    # Rule 2 (Migration): A group from C2 (4-methoxyphenyl or phenyl) migrates to C1. The 4-methoxyphenyl group has a higher migratory aptitude due to the electron-donating methoxy group.
    # Expected Product C: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
    expected_product_C = "2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one"
