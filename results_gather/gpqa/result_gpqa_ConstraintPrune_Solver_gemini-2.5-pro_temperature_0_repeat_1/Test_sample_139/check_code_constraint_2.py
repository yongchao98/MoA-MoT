    # Clue: "The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K."
    # Analysis: 273.15 K is the melting point of H2O. 277 K is 3.85 °C.
    # The melting point of heavy water (D2O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K.
    # This strongly suggests B is D2O (heavy water).

        return f"Constraint check failed: The melting point of the identified substance B ({substance_B}, {melting_point_D2O_K}K) is not close enough to 277 K."

    # Clue: "Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements..."
    # Analysis: Since B is D2O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H). So X must contain Deuterium.

    # Clue: "...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons..."
    # Analysis: Let's test candidates for gas W.
    # - D2 (Deuterium gas): Protons = 1+1=2. Neutrons = (2-1)+(2-1)=2. Protons == Neutrons. This is a strong candidate.
    # - He: Protons = 2. Neutrons = 2. Match, but unlikely product.
    # - N2: Protons = 14. Neutrons = 14. Match.
    # - CO: Protons = 14. Neutrons = 14. Match.
    # Given the context of Deuterium, D2 is the most logical choice for W.

    # Clue: "...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D2O)."
    # Clue: "The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry."
    # Clue: "The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen."
    # Analysis: These clues point towards a powerful deuterated reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) is a famous strong reducing agent. Its "very close analog" is sodium borohydride (NaBH4).
    # The deuterated version would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD4.
    # Let's test if X = LiAlD4 fits all clues.
    substance_X_candidate = "LiAlD4"

    # Check reaction: LiAlD4 + 4 D2O -> LiOD + Al(OD)3 + 4 D2
    # - Y = D2O (liquid)
    # - Reaction is violent. (Correct, hydrides react violently with water/heavy water).
    # - W = D2 (gas with equal protons and neutrons). (Correct).
    # - G = Al(OD)3 (precipitate). (Correct, aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate).
    # - Heating G: 2Al(OD)3 -> Al2O3 + 3D2O. Releases B=D2O. (Correct).

    # Check reaction with a keto acid:
    # A simple keto acid is pyruvic acid (CH3-CO-COOH), which has 3 oxygen atoms.
    # LiAlH4 (and thus LiAlD4) reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.
    # CH3-CO-COOH --(1. LiAlD4, 2. H2O workup)--> CH3-CH(OH)-CH2OH (1,2-Propanediol).
    # The product has 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue.
    
    # Conclusion from clues: Substance X is LiAlD4.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the required value based on the identified substance ---

    # Substance X is LiAlD4.
    # The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).
    # Atomic numbers: H=1, Li=3, Al=13.
    # The lightest element is Hydrogen.
    # The heaviest element is Aluminum.

    # The question asks for the "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X".
    # It specifies: "...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

    # Mass of the lightest element's instances (Hydrogen):
    # There are 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H).
    # The approximate integer atomic mass of one Deuterium atom is 2.
    mass_of_lightest_element_instances = 4 * 2  # 8

    # Mass of the heaviest element's instances (Aluminum):
    # There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The most common isotope is ²⁷Al.
    # The approximate integer atomic mass of one Aluminum atom is 27.
    mass_of_heaviest_element_instances = 1 * 27  # 27

    # Cumulative atomic mass:
    calculated_cumulative_mass = mass_of_lightest_element_instances + mass_of_heaviest_element_instances
    
    # --- Step 3: Compare the calculated result with the LLM's answer ---
