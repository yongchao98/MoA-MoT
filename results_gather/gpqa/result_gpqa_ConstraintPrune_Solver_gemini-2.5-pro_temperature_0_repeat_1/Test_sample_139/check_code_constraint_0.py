    # W = D2 (Deuterium gas)
    # G = Al(OD)3 (Aluminium deuteroxide)
    
    # --- Step 2: Verify each constraint from the question against the identified substances ---

    # Constraint 1: "The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K."
    # The melting point of heavy water (D2O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K.

    # Constraint 2: "a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons"
    # The identified gas W is D2.
    # Deuterium (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.
    # Therefore, D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

        return f"Incorrect: Constraint on gas W is not satisfied. The identified gas W (D2) has {protons_in_W} protons and {neutrons_in_W} neutrons. They are not equal."

    # Constraint 3: "a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B"
    # The identified G is Al(OD)3 and B is D2O.
    # The decomposition reaction is 2Al(OD)3 --(heat)--> Al2O3 + 3D2O.
    # This chemical fact is correct. The product released is indeed D2O (B).
    
    # Constraint 4: "The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen."
    # A keto acid (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH3-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms.
    # A strong reducing agent like LiAlD4 (X) reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohols,
    # yielding a diol (e.g., CH3-CH(OH)-CH2(OH)), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This is correct.

    # Constraint 5: "The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry."
    # The identified analog is LiAlH4 (Lithium Aluminium Hydride), which is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This is correct.

    # --- Step 3: Perform the final calculation based on the identified Substance X (LiAlD4) ---
    
    # Elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D).
    # Atomic numbers: H(D)=1, Li=3, Al=13.
    # Lightest element is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).
    # Heaviest element is Aluminium (Al).
    
    # The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.
    # This means summing the masses of ALL atoms of the lightest element and ALL atoms of the heaviest element.
    
    # In LiAlD4, there are:
    # - 4 atoms of the lightest element (D).
    # - 1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).
    
    # Using integer atomic masses for the specific isotopes:
    # Mass of Deuterium (D) ≈ 2 amu.
    # Mass of the most common isotope of Aluminium (27Al) ≈ 27 amu.
    
    mass_of_all_lightest_atoms = 4 * 2  # 4 Deuterium atoms
