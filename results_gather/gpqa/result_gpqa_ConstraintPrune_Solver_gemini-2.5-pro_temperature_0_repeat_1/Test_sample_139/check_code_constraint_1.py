    # Constraint: "a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B"
    # The decomposition of G (Al(OD)3) is: 2Al(OD)3 --(heat)--> Al2O3 + 3D2O.
    # The released substance is D2O, which is the identified substance B. This is chemically correct.

    # Constraint: "The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen."
    # A keto acid (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH3-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms.
    # A strong reducing agent like X (LiAlD4) reduces it to a diol (e.g., CH3-CD(OH)-CD2(OH)).
    # A diol has 2 oxygen atoms. This is chemically correct.

    # Constraint: "The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry."
    # The analog of X (LiAlD4) is LiAlH4, which is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This is correct.
