    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem by modeling it as constraints.\n\n**Constraint Modeling & Pruning Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the most restrictive constraint:** The melting point of substance B is a precise numerical value (≈ 277 K). This is an excellent starting point to identify B.\n2.  **Chain the deductions:** Use the identity of B to deduce the nature of G. Use the properties of G and the reaction to deduce X, Y, and W.\n3.  **Verify with all constraints:** Once a candidate for X is found, verify it against all other clues (reaction with keto acid, nature of its analog).\n4.  **Perform the final calculation:** Once X is confidently identified, calculate the required sum of atomic masses.\n\n**Iteration 1: Identify Substance B**\n\n*   **Constraint:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n*   **Analysis:** 277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Pruning:**\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This is close, but not \"very close\".\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match for \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance B is very likely heavy water, D₂O.\n\n**Iteration 2: Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Constraint 1:** B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydroxide, like a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n*   **Constraint 2:** Gas W, produced in the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Candidates: D₂ (2p, 2n), ¹²CO (14p, 14n), ¹⁴N₂ (14p, 14n), ¹⁶O₂ (16p, 16n).\n    *   Since D₂O is involved, Deuterium (D) is present in the system. D₂ is a very strong candidate for W.\n*   **Constraint 3:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope, reacts with a keto acid to yield a product with 2 oxygens, and its analog is a common organic reagent.\n    *   A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A product with 2 oxygens implies a reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)).\n    *   Powerful reducing agents are needed for this. The most common is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its milder analog is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   This strongly suggests the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n    *   Therefore, Substance X, which contains a heavier isotope, must be **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n*   **Constraint 4 (Verification):** Let's test the full reaction with X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce W (gas) and G (precipitate).\n    *   If W is D₂, then the reaction must supply D atoms. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + Y -> D₂ + G.\n    *   The most plausible liquid Y that would react violently and complete the reaction is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Let's check the products:\n        *   **Gas W:** D₂. Protons = 2, Neutrons = 2. (p=n). This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). This is a precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O. This fits.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. We have confidently identified Substance X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Task:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Deuterium (D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Masses:**\n    *   We use integer masses for isotopes: Mass(D) ≈ 2 amu.
