    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    It performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the physical constants and matrix operators (Ay, Az, A^2) from the problem statement.
    2. Calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.
    3. Systematically evaluates the truthfulness of each statement (A, B, C, D).
    4. Compares the calculated correct statement with the LLM's answer ('A').
