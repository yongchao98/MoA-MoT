    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem based on chemical constraints.\n\n### Constraint Analysis\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Products of Reaction I**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single, defined chiral center at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH (a strong, achiral reducing agent) creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    *   **Outcome:** The hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, leading to two possible configurations at C3 (R or S). This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have one chiral center in common (S at C5) and one that is different (R/S at C3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces **2** stereoisomeric products.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Products of Reaction II**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH4 creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Outcome:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **3** stereoisomeric products (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Analysis by Normal-Phase HPLC**\n    *   **Principle:** Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. It can, however, separate diastereomers, meso compounds, and molecules with different structures.\n    *   **Applying to the mixture:**\n        *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities, ensuring they separate from each other.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Analysis by Chiral HPLC**\n    *   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, including enantiomers. It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n    *   **Applying to the mixture:** We have a total of 5 unique stereoisomers in the combined product mixture.\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all five of these distinct molecules.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### Summary and Code Verification\n\nThe analysis concludes there will be 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC. The following Python code formalizes this counting process and verifies each constraint.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_hplc_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the products of two reactions and determines the number of HPLC peaks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define Products based on Stereochemistry ---\n    # Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one -> (3R,5S) + (3S,5S) diastereomers\n    products_rxn1 = [\n        \"Diastereomer 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\",\n        \"Diastereomer 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"\n    ]\n\n    # Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione -> (2R,4R) + (2S,4S) enantiomers + meso compound\n    products_rxn2 = [\n        \"Enantiomer 1: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\",\n        \"Enantiomer 2: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\",\n        \"Meso Compound: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\"\n    ]\n\n    all_products = products_rxn1 + products_rxn2\n    print(\"--- Constraint Analysis ---\")\n\n    # Constraint 1: Number of products from Reaction I\n    num_rxn1 = len(products_rxn1)\n    pass_c1 = (num_rxn1 == 2)\n    print(f\"\\nConstraint 1: Reaction I produces 2 diastereomers.\")\n    print(f\"Candidates from Rxn I: {products_rxn1}\")\n    print(f\"Pass/Fail: {'Pass' if pass_c1 else 'Fail'}\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: Number of products from Reaction II\n    num_rxn2 = len(products_rxn2)\n    pass_c2 = (num_rxn2 == 3)\n    print(f\"\\nConstraint 2: Reaction II produces 3 stereoisomers.\")\n    print(f\"Candidates from Rxn II: {products_rxn2}\")\n    print(f\"Pass/Fail: {'Pass' if pass_c2 else 'Fail'}\")\n\n    # Constraint 3: Normal-Phase HPLC Peak Count\n    # Grouping logic: Diastereomers and different structures separate.
