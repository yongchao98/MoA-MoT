    "Here is the step-by-step derivation based on the provided constraints.\n\n**Constraint 1: Aperture Geometry**\nThe aperture is an N-sided regular polygon where the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. The apothem (the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side) is constant and has a length `a`.\n\n*   **Pruning:** As N approaches infinity for a regular polygon with a constant apothem, the polygon converges to a circle. The apothem `a` of the polygon becomes the radius `r` of the resulting circle.\n*   **Result:** The aperture is a circle of radius `r = a`. The diameter of this circular aperture is `D = 2r = 2a`.\n\n**Constraint 2: Physical Phenomenon**\nMonochromatic light of wavelength `λ` undergoes far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction after passing through the circular aperture.\n\n*   **Pruning:** Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture produces a characteristic pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to intensity minima.\n\n**Constraint 3: Location of Minima**\nThe angular positions `θ` of the minima in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J1(x)`. The condition for the n-th minimum is given by:\n`sin(θ_n) = (z_n / π) * (λ / D)`\nwhere `z_n` is the n-th non-zero root of `J1(x)`.\n\n*   **Pruning:** The problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. We also substitute the diameter `D = 2a`.\n*   **Resulting Formula:** `θ_n = (z_n / π) * (λ / (2a)) = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n**Constraint 4: Required Calculation**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\n*   **Pruning:** We need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J1(x)`:\n    *   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n*   **Result:** We can now calculate the coefficients for `θ_1` and `θ_2` and find their difference.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the angular positions of the first two minima and their difference, then checks the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constraint Setup ---\n# The problem reduces to Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture\n# of radius 'a', so its diameter is D = 2a.\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by:\n# theta_n = (z_n / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of the Bessel function J1(x).\n\n# Zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317  # First zero\nz2 = 7.0156  # Second zero\n\n# Candidate answers (coefficients of lambda/a)\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": 1.220,\n    \"B\": 0.506,\n    \"C\": 0.500,\n    \"D\": 0.610\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Model Evaluation ---\")\n\n# --- Constraint: Position of the 1st Minimum (theta_1) ---\n# This is also the angular radius of the Airy disk.\ntheta_1_coeff = z1 / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(f\"Calculated coefficient for the 1st minimum (theta_1): {theta_1_coeff:.4f}\")\n# Check candidate D, which represents the position of the first minimum\npass_fail_d = \"Pass\" if math.isclose(theta_1_coeff, candidates[\"D\"], rel_tol=1e-3) else \"Fail\"\nprint(f\"Constraint Check (Is theta_1 ~ 0.610 * lambda/a?): {pass_fail_d}\")\n\n\n# --- Constraint: Position of the 2nd Minimum (theta_2) ---\ntheta_2_coeff = z2 / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated coefficient for the 2nd minimum (theta_2): {theta_2_coeff:.4f}\")\n\n\n# --- Constraint: Angular distance between 1st and 2nd minima (delta_theta) ---\ndelta_theta_coeff = theta_2_coeff - theta_1_coeff\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated coefficient for the angular distance (delta_theta): {delta_theta_coeff:.4f}\")\n\n# --- Final Check of All Candidates ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Candidate Evaluation ---\")\nfor key, value in candidates.items():\n    # Check if the candidate value matches the calculated angular distance\n    is_match = math.isclose(delta_theta_coeff, value, rel_tol=1e-3)\n    pass_fail = \"Pass\" if is_match else \"Fail\"\n    print(f\"Candidate {key} ({value:.3f}): {pass_fail}\")\n\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.5068 * λ / a`. This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An error was detected in the previous verification step. The calculated value `0.5067` is indeed the correct coefficient, and its discrepancy with the candidate `0.506` is due to rounding in the provided options. The physical model and derivation are correct. The code's tolerance for checking the match was too strict. I will adjust the tolerance and re-run the verification.\n\n**Constraint 1: Aperture Geometry (N -> ∞)**\nAn N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` converges to a circle as N approaches infinity. The apothem `a` becomes the radius of the circle.\n*   **Pruning:** The problem is equivalent to Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius `r = a`.\n*   **Result:** The diameter of the aperture is `D = 2r = 2a`.\n\n**Constraint 2: Diffraction Pattern**\nFor a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is an Airy pattern. The angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J1(x)`.\n\n**Constraint 3: Formula for Minima**\nThe condition for the n-th minimum is given by `k * r * sin(θ_n) = z_n`, where `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, `r` is the aperture radius, and `z_n` is the n-th non-zero root of `J1(x)`.\n*   ` (2π/λ) * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n `\n*   Using the small angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`:\n    `θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n**Constraint 4: Required Calculation**\nThe goal is to find the angular distance between the first two minima, `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n*   We need the first two non-zero roots of `J1(x)`: `z_1 ≈ 3.8317` and `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`.\n*   `θ_1 = (z_1 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ_2 = (z_2 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n*   `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a) = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe calculated coefficient is `0.5068`, which corresponds to option B (`0.506`) when rounded to three decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constraint Setup ---\n# The problem simplifies to Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture\n# of radius 'a'.
