    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the diffraction problem.

    The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima for
    Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.

    The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by:
    theta_n = (z_n / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)
    where z_n is the n-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J1(x).

    The required angular distance is Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.
    The coefficient to be calculated is C = (z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi).
