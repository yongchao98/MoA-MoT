    Question: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 
              2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with 
              red phosphorus and excess of HI?

    # --- 1. Analyze the Reactant Structure ---
    # The reactant is "2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid".

    # From "-3-ene", "vinyl", "formyl", and "carboxylic acid": The molecule has pi bonds.
    # - "cyclohex-3-ene": 1 C=C pi bond in the ring.
    # - "vinyl" (-CH=CH2): 1 C=C pi bond.
    # - "formyl" (-CHO): 1 C=O pi bond.
    # - "carboxylic acid" (-COOH): 1 C=O pi bond.

    # --- 2. Analyze the Reaction ---
    # The reagent is "red phosphorus and excess of HI".
    # This is a powerful reducing agent known for the Clemmensen-like reduction of all
    # oxygen-containing functional groups and hydrogenation of all multiple bonds.
    
    # Effect of the reaction on structural features:
    # - Rings: The carbon skeleton, including rings, is preserved.
    # - Pi Bonds: All pi bonds (C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds.

    # The number of rings in the product is the same as in the reactant.
