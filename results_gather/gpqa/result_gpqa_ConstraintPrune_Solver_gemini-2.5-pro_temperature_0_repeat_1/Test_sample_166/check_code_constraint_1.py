    """
    This function verifies the calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) for a specific
    Schr√∂dinger cat state.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the problem parameters (alpha, phi).
    2. Confirms that the entropy of the initial state `rho` is zero, as it is a pure state.
    3. Calculates the second moments (<n> and <a^2>) of the state `rho`.
    4. Uses these moments to define the reference Gaussian state `tau`.
    5. Calculates the symplectic eigenvalue `nu` for `tau`.
    6. Calculates the von Neumann entropy `S(tau)` from `nu`.
    7. The non-Gaussianity `nG` is equal to `S(tau)`.
    8. Compares the calculated `nG` with the provided answer (1.38).
