    "The task is to identify the immunological process responsible for generating high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within Peyer's patches after oral administration of a viral antigen.\n\n**Constraint Modeling & Pruning:**\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Location.** The process must occur in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, where adaptive immune responses to gut antigens are initiated.\n    *   *VDJ recombination* occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells). This option is pruned.\n    *   *Somatic hypermutation* occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. This option is kept.\n    *   *Complement activation* is a humoral process, primarily in blood and tissues, not a cellular genetic event in a lymphoid organ. This option is pruned.\n    *   *Class switching recombination* occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. This option is kept.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Genetic Target.** The process must cause high variability specifically in the *variable* region of the heavy chain gene, as observed by sequencing.\n    *   *Somatic hypermutation* introduces point mutations throughout the variable region, directly causing the observed variability. This option is kept.\n    *   *Class switching recombination* involves excising and rejoining gene segments in the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which changes the antibody class (e.g., IgM to IgA) but does not alter the variable region. This option is pruned.\n\nAfter applying the constraints, only somatic hypermutation remains as a candidate. The process involves proliferating B cells (centroblasts) in the germinal centers of Peyer's patches that have taken up the antigen. These cells undergo rapid mutation in their variable region genes, followed by selection for higher affinity, which perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_processes(question_details):\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the immunological question as a set of constraints and evaluates the options.\n    \"\"\"\n    candidates = {\n        \"A) VDJ recombination\": True,\n        \"B) somatic hypermutation\": True,\n        \"C) complement activation\": True,\n        \"D) class switching recombination\": True\n    }\n    \n    final_candidates = []\n\n    # Constraint 1: Location must be a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch).\n    # VDJ recombination occurs in primary lymphoid organs.\n    # Complement is a humoral system, not a cellular process localized this way.\n    print(\"--- Constraint 1: Location (Secondary Lymphoid Organ) ---\")\n    c1_pass = [\"B) somatic hypermutation\", \"D) class switching recombination\"]\n    for candidate in list(candidates.keys()):\n        if candidate in c1_pass:\n            print(f\"{candidate}: Pass\")\n        else:\n            candidates[candidate] = False\n            print(f\"{candidate}: Fail\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: Must be triggered by antigen in mature cells that are now proliferating.\n    # VDJ recombination happens before antigen encounter.\n    print(\"\\n--- Constraint 2: Trigger (Antigen-driven proliferation) ---\")\n    c2_pass = [\"B) somatic hypermutation\", \"D) class switching recombination\"]\n    for candidate, status in candidates.items():\n        if not status:\n            continue\n        if candidate in c2_pass:\n            print(f\"{candidate}: Pass\")\n        else:\n            candidates[candidate] = False\n            print(f\"{candidate}: Fail\")\n\n    # Constraint 3: Must cause high variability in the VARIABLE heavy chain gene.\n    # Class switching recombination affects the CONSTANT region.\n    print(\"\\n--- Constraint 3: Genetic Target (Variable Region) ---\")\n    c3_pass = [\"B) somatic hypermutation\"]\n    for candidate, status in candidates.items():\n        if not status:\n            continue\n        if candidate in c3_pass:\n            print(f\"{candidate}: Pass\")\n        else:\n            candidates[candidate] = False\n            print(f\"{candidate}: Fail\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Candidates after Pruning ---\")\n    for candidate, status in candidates.items():\n        if status:\n            final_candidates.append(candidate)\n    \n    if final_candidates:\n        print(\"Candidate(s):\", \", \".join(final_candidates))\n    else:\n        print(\"No candidates passed all constraints.\")\n\n# Run the evaluation\nevaluate_processes(\"High variability in variable heavy chain of proliferating cells in Peyer's patch.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
