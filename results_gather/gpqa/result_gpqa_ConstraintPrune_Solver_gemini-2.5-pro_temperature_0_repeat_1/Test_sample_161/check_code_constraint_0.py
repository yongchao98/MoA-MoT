def check_pseudosphere_area():
    """
    Checks the calculation of the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric.

    The metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) * (dx^2 + dy^2).
    The area is for a "pseudosphere of radius r=2".

    The area element is dA = sqrt(det(g)) dx dy.
    From the metric, the metric tensor g is diagonal with:
    g_xx = g_yy = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)
    det(g) = g_xx * g_yy = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2))^2
    sqrt(det(g)) = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2) for the domain where 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0.

    The area A is the integral of dA over the domain. The "radius r=2" and the
    singularity at x^2 + y^2 = 4 imply the domain is the open disk x^2 + y^2 < 4.

    We convert to polar coordinates for easier integration:
    x = rho * cos(theta), y = rho * sin(theta)
    x^2 + y^2 = rho^2
    dx dy = rho d(rho) d(theta)
    The domain becomes: 0 <= rho < 2, 0 <= theta < 2*pi.

    The integral for the area is:
    A = integral from 0 to 2*pi [ integral from 0 to 2 [ (32 / (4 - rho^2)) * rho d(rho) ] ] d(theta)

        # non-zero measure cannot be zero. So, A is incorrect.
        # This leaves B (+infinity) as the only plausible option.
