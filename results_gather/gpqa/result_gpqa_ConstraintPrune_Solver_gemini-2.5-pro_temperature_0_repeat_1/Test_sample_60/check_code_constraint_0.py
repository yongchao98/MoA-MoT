    # --- Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence ---

    # Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4.
    # This is electrophilic nitration.
    # Product 1: Nitrobenzene
    product_1 = "Nitrobenzene"

    # Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder.
    # This is electrophilic bromination of nitrobenzene.
    # The nitro group (-NO2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
    # Therefore, bromine adds to the meta position (position 3).
    # Product 2: 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene
    # Key feature for the final product: The bromine atom must be at position 3 relative to the point of attachment.
    bromo_position_rule = 3

    # Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.
    # This is catalytic hydrogenation, which reduces the nitro group to an amine.
    # Product 3: 3-bromoaniline
    product_3 = "3-bromoaniline"

    # Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4.
    # This is a diazotization reaction, forming a diazonium salt.
    # Product 4: 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate
    product_4 = "3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate"

    # Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole.
    # This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. The 3-bromophenyl radical/cation attacks anisole.
    # Anisole is methoxybenzene. The methoxy group (-OCH3) is a strongly activating, ortho,para-director.
    # Due to steric hindrance, the para-product is majorly favored.
    # The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para-position (position 4) of the anisole ring.
    # Key feature for the final product: The methoxy group must be at position 4 relative to the point of attachment.
    methoxy_position_rule = 4
    # The coupling partner is anisole, so the second ring must have a methoxy group.
    second_ring_substituent_rule = "methoxy"

    # --- Expected Final Product based on the analysis ---
    # The final product is a biphenyl with:
    # - A bromine at position 3 on one ring.
    # - A methoxy group at position 4' on the other ring.
