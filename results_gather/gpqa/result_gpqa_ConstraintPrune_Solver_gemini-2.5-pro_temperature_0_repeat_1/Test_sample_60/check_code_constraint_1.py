    This function simulates the described multi-step organic synthesis
    to verify the correctness of the final product. It follows a rule-based
    approach to model the reactions.

    The reaction sequence is:
    1. Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Product 1 (Nitration)
    2. Product 1 + Br2/Fe -> Product 2 (Bromination)
    3. Product 2 + H2, Pd/C -> Product 3 (Reduction)
    4. Product 3 + NaNO2/HBF4 -> Product 4 (Diazotization)
    5. Product 4 heated + Anisole -> Product 5 (Gomberg-Bachmann Coupling)

    # --- Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis ---

    # Step 1: Nitration of Benzene
    # Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with the nitronium ion (NO2+)
    # to form nitrobenzene.
    # Product 1: Nitrobenzene
    # Structure: A benzene ring with a -NO2 group.

    # Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene
    # The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating and meta-directing group.
    # Electrophilic bromination will place the bromine atom at the meta position (C3)
    # relative to the nitro group.
    # Product 2: 3-bromonitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene)
    # Structure: A benzene ring with -NO2 at C1 and -Br at C3.

    # Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group
    # Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) reduces the nitro group (-NO2) to a
    # primary amine (-NH2) without affecting the C-Br bond under typical conditions.
    # Product 3: 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline)
    # Structure: A benzene ring with -NH2 at C1 and -Br at C3.

    # Step 4: Diazotization
    # The primary aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium salt using NaNO2 and acid (HBF4).
    # Product 4: 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate
    # Structure: A benzene ring with -N2+ at C1 and -Br at C3.

    # Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction
    # The diazonium salt is heated in the presence of another aromatic compound (anisole).
    # This forms a radical (the 3-bromophenyl radical) which attacks the anisole ring.
    # Anisole (methoxybenzene) has an activating, ortho,para-directing methoxy group (-OCH3).
    # The attack will occur predominantly at the para position (C4 of the anisole ring) due to less steric hindrance.
    # The result is a biphenyl molecule where the two rings are joined.
    # Ring 1 (from the diazonium salt) has a bromine at its position 3.
    # Ring 2 (from anisole) has a methoxy group at its position 4.
    # Final Product 5 Name: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

            "4. Diazotization gives the 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt.\n"
            "5. The final Gomberg-Bachmann coupling with anisole involves the 3-bromophenyl group attacking anisole. The methoxy group of anisole is para-directing, leading to the formation of 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl."
