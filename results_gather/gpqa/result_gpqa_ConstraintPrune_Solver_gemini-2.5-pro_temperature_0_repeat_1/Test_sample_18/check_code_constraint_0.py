def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given LLM answer for a chemistry problem
    involving two Michael addition reactions.

    It verifies two main constraints:
    1. Reaction A: The addition must occur at the C1 position of the cyclohexanone ring,
       which is the most acidic site.
    2. Reaction B: The product must be a Michael adduct, not a succinate derivative, which
       has an incorrect carbon skeleton (1,4-dicarbonyl vs. 1,5-dicarbonyl).
