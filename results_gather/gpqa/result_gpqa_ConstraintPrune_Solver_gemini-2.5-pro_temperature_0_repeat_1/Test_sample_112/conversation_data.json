    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the constraints to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe spectroscopic data provides evidence for multiple degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **1H NMR:** The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **FTIR:** The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for a second degree of unsaturation. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms the C=C bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nWe will now prune the candidate list by calculating the DoU for each formula using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n**Constraint 2: Functional Group Identification (FTIR)**\n\n*   **FTIR:** The combination of a \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\" and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule must be a carboxylic acid and therefore must contain two oxygen atoms.\n\nWe will prune the remaining candidates based on the number of oxygen atoms.\n\n**Constraint 3: Mass Spectrometry Fragmentation**\n\n*   **Mass Spec:** A fragment peak is observed at m/z = 45.\n*   **Analysis:** This mass corresponds to the mass of a protonated carboxyl group `[COOH]+` (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This is a very common and characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids, often formed via alpha-cleavage.\n*   **Conclusion:** This observation strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group, reinforcing the conclusion from Constraint 2.\n\nThe following Python code automates this pruning process.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n    import re\n    # Parse the formula string e.g., C6H12O2\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    for element, count in parts:\n        counts[element] = int(count) if count else 1\n    \n    # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    if 'C' in counts and 'H' in counts:\n        return counts['C'] + 1 - (counts['H'] / 2)\n    return 0\n\ndef get_oxygen_count(formula):\n    \"\"\"Gets the number of oxygen atoms from a formula string.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    match = re.search(r'O(\\d*)', formula)\n    if not match:\n        return 0\n    count_str = match.group(1)\n    return int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n\n# Initial list of candidates\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H12O\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Initial candidates:\", candidates)\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) >= 2 ---\n# Evidence: Vinyl H in NMR (C=C) and 1700 cm-1 peak in FTIR (C=O)\nprint(\"Applying Constraint 1: Degree of Unsaturation must be >= 2\")\nremaining_candidates_1 = {}\nfor key, formula in candidates.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    pass_fail = \"Pass\" if dou >= 2 else \"Fail\"\n    print(f\"Candidate {key} ({formula}): DoU = {dou}.
