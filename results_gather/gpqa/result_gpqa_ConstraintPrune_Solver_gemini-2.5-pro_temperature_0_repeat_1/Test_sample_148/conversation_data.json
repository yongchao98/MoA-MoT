    "This problem requires analyzing spectroscopic and chromatographic data to identify the nature of a sample mixture. Let's model the observations as a set of constraints to prune the possible options.\n\n**Constraint 1: Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Observation:** LC-MS shows two peaks, but both have the *same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the expected molecule.\n*   **Implication:** The two species in the mixture are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass).\n*   **Pruning:**\n    *   A) Enantiomers: PASS (are isomers)\n    *   B) Precursor: FAIL (a precursor would have a different, likely lower, mass)\n    *   C) 'Double coupling': FAIL (a double-coupled product would have a different, higher, mass)\n    *   D) Diastereoisomers: PASS (are isomers)\n*   **Remaining Candidates:** A, D\n\n**Constraint 2: 1H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton. The peaks have roughly equal integrals.\n*   **Implication:** The sample contains two distinct chemical species in a ~1:1 ratio. These species must have different magnetic environments for the observed proton. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give a single set of peaks. Diastereomers, however, are chemically distinct and will give different sets of peaks.\n*   **Pruning:**\n    *   A) Enantiomers: FAIL (would give a single set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment)\n    *   D) Diastereoisomers: PASS (are distinct compounds and give unique NMR spectra)\n*   **Remaining Candidates:** D\n\n**Constraint 3: Liquid Chromatography (LC)**\n*   **Observation:** The two species are separated by LC, even at elevated temperatures.\n*   **Implication:** The two species have different physical properties, allowing for separation on a standard (achiral) column. Enantiomers cannot be separated on a standard achiral column. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are readily separated. The fact that they remain separated at elevated temperature indicates they are stable, configurationally distinct isomers, not rapidly interconverting conformers (which might coalesce into a single peak at high temp).\n*   **Pruning:**\n    *   A) Enantiomers: FAIL (not separable by standard achiral LC)\n    *   D) Diastereoisomers: PASS (are separable by standard achiral LC)\n*   **Remaining Candidates:** D\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly the diastereoisomer hypothesis is consistent with all three experimental constraints. This situation commonly arises in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid starting materials was not enantiomerically pure (e.g., a racemic D/L mixture was used instead of the pure L- or D-amino acid). This results in the synthesis of two diastereomeric peptides that have the same mass but different physical and spectroscopic properties.\n\n<<<D>>>"
