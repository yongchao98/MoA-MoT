    Checks the derivation for the number of stars per unit distance.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the relationship between the cumulative number of stars (N) and parallax (plx).
       N(>plx) ‚àù 1/plx^5
    2. Defines the relationship between parallax (plx) and distance (r).

    3. Substitutes (2) into (1) to find the cumulative number of stars within a distance r, N(<r).
    4. Differentiates N(<r) with respect to r to find the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr.
    5. Checks if the final result is proportional to r^4, which corresponds to option C.
