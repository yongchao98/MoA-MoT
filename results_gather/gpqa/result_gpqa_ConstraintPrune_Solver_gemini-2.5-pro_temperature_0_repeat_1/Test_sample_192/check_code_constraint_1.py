    This function checks the derivation for an astronomy problem involving star counts.

    Problem Statement:
    - The cumulative number of stars with parallax > plx, N(>plx), is proportional to 1/plx^5.
    - Parallax (plx) and distance (r) are related by plx = 1/r.
    - Find the proportionality for the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr.

    The provided answer is C, which corresponds to dN/dr being proportional to r^4.

    # 1. Define the mathematical symbols
    # C is the constant of proportionality.
    # r (distance) and plx (parallax) are positive real variables.
    r, plx, C = sympy.symbols('r plx C', positive=True, real=True)

    # 2. State the given relationship (Constraint 1)
    # N(>plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5.

    # 3. Convert the relationship from parallax to distance
    # Since plx = 1/r, a star with parallax > plx is the same as a star with distance < r.
    # So, N(<r) = N(>plx). We substitute plx = 1/r into the equation.
