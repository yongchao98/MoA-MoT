    This function verifies the solution to the given astronomy problem.

    Problem statement:
    - The number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5.
    - Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r.
    - The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) and r.

    The provided answer is C, which corresponds to dN/dr being proportional to r^4.
    This function will perform the derivation symbolically and check if the result matches the answer.

        # Constraint 1: The number of stars varies with parallax.
        # This is interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than plx, N(>plx).

        # Step 1: Express the cumulative number of stars in terms of distance r.
        # A parallax *greater* than a value 'plx' corresponds to a distance *less* than 'r'.
        # Therefore, N(>plx) is equivalent to the cumulative number of stars within distance r, N(<r).
