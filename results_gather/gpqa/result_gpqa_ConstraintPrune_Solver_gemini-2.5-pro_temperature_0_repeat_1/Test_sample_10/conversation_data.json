    "I will model the task by breaking down each statement into a set of verifiable constraints. My analysis will prioritize identifying fundamental contradictions in molecular biology principles to prune the search space effectively.\n\n**Constraint Modeling & Pruning**\n\n*   **Statement A:** Concerns the ORF3a protein and its role in apoptosis.\n    *   Constraint A1: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation.\n    *   Constraint A2: ORF3a does not affect Bcl-2 levels.\n    *   Constraint A3: The conclusion is that apoptosis is induced via the extrinsic pathway.\n    *   *Analysis:* This describes a plausible biological mechanism. Viral proteins often manipulate host cell apoptosis. The distinction between the extrinsic (caspase-8) and intrinsic (Bcl-2) pathways is correct. The statement's validity depends on the specific experimental findings for ORF3a. This requires specific knowledge verification.\n\n*   **Statement B:** Concerns the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex.\n    *   Constraint B1: It's a heterodimer involved in mismatch repair.\n    *   Constraint B2: The nsp14 ExoN domain binds nsp10 to form an active exonuclease.\n    *   Constraint B3: The complex *prevents the breakdown of dsRNA*.\n    *   *Analysis:* An exonuclease, by definition, is an enzyme that cleaves nucleotides from the end of a polynucleotide chain. Its role in mismatch repair is to *remove* incorrectly incorporated nucleotides, which involves *breaking down* a segment of the RNA strand. The claim that it *prevents* breakdown is a direct contradiction of its known enzymatic function. This statement is highly suspect.\n\n*   **Statement C:** Concerns programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\n    *   Constraint C1: It's a -1 frameshift creating two polyproteins.\n    *   Constraint C2: It uses a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot.\n    *   Constraint C3: The SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting signal is conformationally similar to that of SARS-CoV.\n    *   *Analysis:* This is a textbook description of the well-established mechanism for coronavirus polyprotein synthesis. This statement appears factually sound.\n\n*   **Statement D:** Concerns the biophysics of the frameshifting pseudoknot.\n    *   Constraint D1: Frameshifting rate is correlated with the number of pseudoknot conformations.\n    *   Constraint D2: Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 signals show two conformations under tension.\n    *   *Analysis:* The link between structural dynamics and biological function is a common principle. While the term \"linearly correlated\" is very specific, the general concept is supported by biophysical studies. This statement is plausible.\n\n**Conclusion from Pruning:** Statement B presents a fundamental contradiction regarding the function of an exonuclease. This makes it the most likely incorrect statement without needing to delve into the finer, and sometimes conflicting, experimental details of the other statements. I will now verify this with a targeted check.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_sars_cov_2_statements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates four statements about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology based on established knowledge.\n    This function simulates the constraint checking process.\n    \"\"\"\n    candidates = {\n        'A': \"SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2.
