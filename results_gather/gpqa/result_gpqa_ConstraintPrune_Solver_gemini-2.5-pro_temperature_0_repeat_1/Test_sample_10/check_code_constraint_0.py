Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.",

        'C': "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",
        'D': "The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates."

    # --- Verification Logic ---
    # We will evaluate each statement and determine which one is factually incorrect.

    # Evaluation of Statement A
    # Fact 1: SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a is known to induce apoptosis.
    # Fact 2: Studies (e.g., Ren et al., Cell Death Discov, 2020) have shown it can activate caspase-8.
    # Fact 3: Caspase-8 is a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Bcl-2 is central to the intrinsic pathway.
    # Conclusion: The statement describes a plausible and scientifically supported mechanism. It is considered correct.
    is_A_correct = True

    # Evaluation of Statement B
    # Fact 1: nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is a heterodimer complex involved in proofreading (a type of mismatch repair). This is correct.
    # Fact 2: The complex has 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, meaning it cleaves or degrades RNA from the 3' end.
    # Fact 3: The statement claims the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA. This is a direct contradiction of the function of an exonuclease, which is to *cause* breakdown/cleavage of nucleic acids to remove errors.
    # Conclusion: The statement contains a fundamental error regarding the enzyme's function. It is incorrect.
    is_B_correct = False
    reason_B_is_incorrect = "The function of the nsp14 exonuclease (ExoN) is to degrade or cleave RNA for proofreading purposes. The statement incorrectly claims that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA, which is the opposite of its enzymatic activity."

    # Evaluation of Statement C
    # Fact 1: Coronaviruses use a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift to produce polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. This is correct.
    # Fact 2: This mechanism relies on a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. This is correct.
    # Fact 3: The frameshifting signal elements are highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This is correct.
    # Conclusion: The statement is a factually accurate description of a well-known process. It is correct.
    is_C_correct = True

    # Evaluation of Statement D
    # Fact 1: Biophysical studies have shown a correlation between the mechanical stability/dynamics of the pseudoknot and frameshifting efficiency.
    # Fact 2: Research using techniques like optical tweezers has identified multiple conformational states for the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots.
    # Conclusion: The statement accurately reflects the current understanding from biophysical research. It is correct.
