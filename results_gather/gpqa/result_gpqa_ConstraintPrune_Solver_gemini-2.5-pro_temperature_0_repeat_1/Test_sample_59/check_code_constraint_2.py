    # --- Key Assumption ---
    # The problem requires the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
    # which is not provided. We must use a standard astronomical value. A commonly
    # cited value is approximately 163,000 light-years. The final calculated answer
    # is sensitive to this value. A slightly different assumed distance (e.g., 159,000 ly)
    # would make the answer 'D' (81 years) almost exact.
    distance_lmc_ly = 163000.0

    # --- Physics Calculations ---
    # 1. Calculate the time for the journey in Earth's reference frame (t_earth).
    #    In relativistic physics, time = distance / speed.
    #    t_earth = (distance_lmc_ly * c) / (v_over_c * c) = distance_lmc_ly / v_over_c
    t_earth = distance_lmc_ly / v_over_c

    # 2. Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (t_astronaut).
    #    This is the "proper time" (Δt₀), which is subject to time dilation.
    #    The formula is: Δt₀ = Δt * sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2), where Δt is t_earth.
