    Checks the correctness of the answer for a bioinformatics drug discovery question.

    The function evaluates each option against key principles of structure-based drug discovery:
    1.  **Workflow Sequence**: Does the step occur *before* initial docking?
    2.  **Problem Handling**: Does the step correctly address the specified complexity (chirality, tautomerism)?
    3.  **Cruciality**: Is the step a fundamental prerequisite for the in silico study itself?
