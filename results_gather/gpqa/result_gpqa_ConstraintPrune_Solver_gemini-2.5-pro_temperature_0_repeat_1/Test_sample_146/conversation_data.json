    "I will model this particle annihilation problem by applying the principle of conservation of energy. The search space consists of the four possible velocities provided as options.\n\n**Constraint 1: Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system must be conserved before and after the annihilation.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We assume the proton is also at rest, making the initial total momentum zero and the initial total energy purely the sum of the rest energies.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n*   **Final State:** The system consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), all with mass $m_A$. To conserve the initial zero momentum, these four particles must fly apart with equal speeds, $v$. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n*   **The Constraint Equation:** $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 \\cdot m_p c^2 = 4 \\cdot \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nTo solve this, we need the rest mass energy of the proton.\n\n<search>proton rest mass energy in MeV</search>\n\nBased on the search result, the proton rest mass energy is approximately 938.3 MeV.
