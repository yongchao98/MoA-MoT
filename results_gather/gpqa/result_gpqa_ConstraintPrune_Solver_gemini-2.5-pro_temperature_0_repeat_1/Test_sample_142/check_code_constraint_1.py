def check_pinacol_rearrangement_answer(llm_answer):
    """
    Checks the correctness of a given answer for the Pinacol rearrangement question.

    The function first validates that the answer is one of the possible choices (A, B, C, D).
    Then, it checks the chemical plausibility of the chosen starting materials and products
    based on established principles of the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement.
