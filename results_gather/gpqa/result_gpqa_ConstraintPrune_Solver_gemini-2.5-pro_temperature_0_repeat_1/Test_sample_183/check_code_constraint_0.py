def check_synthesis_correctness():

    Checks the correctness of the proposed synthetic pathway for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

    The function evaluates four options based on fundamental organic chemistry rules:
    1. Feasibility of Friedel-Crafts alkylation on substituted rings.
    2. The correct sequence for converting a nitro group to an ethoxy group.
