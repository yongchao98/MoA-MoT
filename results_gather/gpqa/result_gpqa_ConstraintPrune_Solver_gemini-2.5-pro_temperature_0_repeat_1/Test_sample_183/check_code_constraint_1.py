def check_synthesis_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the proposed synthesis pathway for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

    The function evaluates four multiple-choice options against a series of chemical rules.
    It identifies fatal flaws in each pathway, such as impossible reactions or incorrect sequencing.
    The correct answer is expected to be the only option that does not violate these fundamental rules.

    Returns:
        str: "Correct" if the provided answer 'B' is the only chemically plausible option,
             otherwise a string explaining the error.
