def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given LLM answer for the organic synthesis question.

    The function analyzes each multiple-choice option based on three fundamental rules of organic synthesis:
    1. Feasibility of Friedel-Crafts reactions on substituted rings.
    2. Correct order of reduction and diazotization.
    3. Stability and subsequent reaction of diazonium salts.

    It determines if the LLM's chosen answer is the only one that does not violate these fundamental rules.
    """
    llm_answer_text = """
    The step-by-step constraint-based analysis successfully identified a single viable synthetic pathway.

    1.  **Constraint 1 (Friedel-Crafts Feasibility):** Option A was eliminated because it attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring, which is not a feasible reaction. Options B, C, and D correctly place this step at the beginning.

    2.  **Constraint 2 (Logical FGI Order):** The conversion of a nitro group to an ethoxy group requires a specific sequence: reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, and ether synthesis. Option C violates this by placing diazotization before reduction. Options B and D maintain the correct relative order of these steps.

    3.  **Constraint 3 (Diazonium Salt Instability):** This was the decisive constraint. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and must be used immediately. Option D fails because it forms a diazonium salt and then attempts a harsh nitration reaction, which would destroy the intermediate. Option B correctly follows the diazotization with hydrolysis, a standard and immediate consumption of the unstable salt.

    Therefore, only Option B presents a chemically logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substituted product, despite the likely low yield of some steps and the extraneous final two steps.
