    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution by modeling the problem as a series of constraints.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**Constraint 1: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature.**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\nSince `T_star`, `R_star`, and the albedo (`A_1 = A_2`) are the same for both planets, the terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nThis means the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**Constraint 2: Relating the semi-major axis to observable quantities.**\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K_star`), which is derived from the Doppler shift (`Δλ`).\n\nThe formula for `K_star` for a planet in a circular orbit (assuming the system is viewed edge-on, i.e., sin(i) ≈ 1, which is a safe assumption given the transit detection) is:\n`K_star = (M_p / M_star) * v_orb`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_orb` is the planet's orbital velocity, given by `v_orb = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)`.\n\nSubstituting `v_orb` into the `K_star` equation:\n`K_star = (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2) = M_p * (G / (M_star * a))^(1/2)`\n\nSolving for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\n**Constraint 3: Formulating the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\nUsing the expression for `a` from Constraint 2, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / M_p1^2) * (K_star1^2 / K_star2^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\n**Constraint 4: Relating the radial velocity amplitude (`K_star`) to the Doppler shift (`Δλ`).**\nThe Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c`. The maximum shift `Δλ` corresponds to the radial velocity amplitude `K_star`.\n`K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\nTherefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n**Final Step: Combining constraints to find the temperature ratio.**\nSubstitute the results from Constraints 3 and 4 back into the equation from Constraint 1:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 ]^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nThis final expression shows that the temperature ratio can be calculated using only the planet masses and their induced Doppler shifts. All other information provided in the problem (`M_star`, `R_star`, `T_star`, `R_p`, `λ_0`) is extraneous for finding this specific ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_planet_temperature_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the exoplanet problem as constraints to find the temperature ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Data & Initial Candidates ---\n    # Planet 1\n    m_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\n    delta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n    # Planet 2\n    m_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\n    delta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n    # Options\n    candidates = {\n        \"A\": 1.05,\n        \"B\": 0.53,\n        \"C\": 0.98,\n        \"D\": 1.30\n    }\n    print(f\"Initial candidates: {candidates}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Constraint Modeling & Pruning ---\n\n    # The final derived model for the temperature ratio is:\n    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n    # We will calculate this value and prune the candidates.\n\n    # Constraint 1: Calculate the ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1).\n    mass_ratio = m_p2 / m_p1\n    print(f\"Constraint 1: Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1) = {m_p2} / {m_p1} = {mass_ratio:.4f}\")\n    print(\"Pass/Fail per candidate: Not applicable at this intermediate stage.\\n\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2).\n    shift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n    print(f\"Constraint 2: Ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) = {delta_lambda_1} / {delta_lambda_2} = {shift_ratio:.4f}\")\n    print(\"Pass/Fail per candidate: Not applicable at this intermediate stage.\\n\")\n\n    # Constraint 3: Calculate the final equilibrium temperature ratio by combining the intermediate ratios.\n    final_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n    print(f\"Constraint 3: Final Temperature Ratio = (Mass Ratio) * (Shift Ratio) = {mass_ratio:.4f} * {shift_ratio:.4f} = {final_ratio:.4f}\")\n    print(\"Pruning candidates based on this final calculated ratio:\")\n\n    # Pruning step: Check which candidate matches the calculated ratio.\n    # A tolerance is used to account for the '~' (approximately) in the options.\n    tolerance = 0.01\n    remaining_candidates = {}\n    for key, value in candidates.items():\n        is_pass = abs(value - final_ratio) < tolerance\n        status = \"Pass\" if is_pass else \"Fail\"\n        if is_pass:\n            remaining_candidates[key] = value\n        print(f\"  - Candidate {key} ({value}): {status}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal candidate(s): {remaining_candidates}\")\n\nsolve_planet_temperature_ratio()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
