    # --- Derivation Check ---
    # The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    # So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2).
    #
    # The semi-major axis 'a' can be related to the planet mass (M_p) and the radial velocity
    # semi-amplitude (K_star) via Kepler's laws and the definition of K_star.
    # The derivation a ∝ M_p^2 / K_star^2 is correct for circular orbits.
    # So, a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2.
    #
    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude K_star is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ.
    # So, K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.
    #
    # Combining these, we get:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 ]^(1/2)
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)
