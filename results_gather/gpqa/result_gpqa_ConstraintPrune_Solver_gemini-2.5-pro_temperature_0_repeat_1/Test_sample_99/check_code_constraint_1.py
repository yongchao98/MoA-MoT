    # --- Step 1: Deduce the compounds based on the reaction sequence ---
    # A (C3H6) + Br2/CCl4 -> B. This electrophilic addition suggests A is propene.
    # C: B (1,2-dibromopropane) + alcoholic KOH -> Propyne (double dehydrohalogenation).
    # D: C (Propyne) passed through red-hot iron tube -> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (cyclic trimerization).
    # F: E (nitrated D) reduced with Fe/HCl -> 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.
    # H: G (diazotized F) hydrolyzed with NaOH -> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.

    # --- Step 2: Evaluate each statement based on the identified compounds ---

    # Statement A: C is a flammable gas.
    # Compound C is propyne. Propyne has a boiling point of -23.2 Â°C, so it is a gas at room temperature.
    # As a small alkyne, it is highly flammable.
    # Verdict for Statement A: Correct.
    is_A_correct = True

    # Statement B: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
    # Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols,
    # typically producing a violet, purple, or green colored complex. A yellow color is the color of the
    # ferric chloride reagent itself, indicating a NEGATIVE test. Due to significant steric hindrance
    # from the three methyl groups, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not form the colored complex.
    # Therefore, the statement that it "gives a yellow color" is a description of a negative test, not a
    # characteristic positive reaction. In the context of identifying an "incorrect statement" about the
    # compound's chemical properties, this is the intended answer.
    # Verdict for Statement B: Incorrect.
    is_B_correct = False

    # Statement C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
    # Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high degree of symmetry (C3 axis),
    # all nine methyl protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal (a singlet). All three
    # aromatic protons are also equivalent and give a second signal (a singlet).
    # Verdict for Statement C: Correct.
    is_C_correct = True

    # Statement D: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
    # Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (derivatives of aniline) are fundamental
    # starting materials for the synthesis of azo dyes via diazotization and coupling reactions.
    # Verdict for Statement D: Correct.
    is_D_correct = True
