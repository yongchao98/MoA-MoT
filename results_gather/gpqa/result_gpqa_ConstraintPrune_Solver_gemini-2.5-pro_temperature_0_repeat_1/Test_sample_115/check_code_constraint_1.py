    # --- Constraint Verification ---

    # Constraint 1: The reaction starts with cis-but-2-ene.
    # The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained in the product.
    # Dienophile: cis-but-2-ene
    # This means the two methyl groups added from the dienophile (which end up at positions C5 and C6 of the product ring) MUST be CIS to each other.

    # Constraint 2: Analyze the stereochemistry of the proposed answer.
    # Proposed Answer (A): (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol
    # We must determine the relative orientation (cis/trans) of the substituents at C5 and C6 from this name.
    # We can do this by determining the required 'up' or 'down' orientation of each substituent to satisfy its R/S designation.
    # Let's assume the hydrogen at each stereocenter is 'up' (dashed wedge) and see what orientation the methyl group needs to be.

    # Analysis of C5 and C6 in (1S,4R,5S,6R):
    # - At C5(S): To get an 'S' configuration with the H 'up', the path from priority 1 (C4) to 2 (C6) to 3 (CH3) must be clockwise. This requires the C5-CH3 group to be 'down'.
    # - At C6(R): To get an 'R' configuration with the H 'up', the path from priority 1 (C1) to 2 (C5) to 3 (CH3) must be counter-clockwise. This requires the C6-CH3 group to be 'up'.

    # Result of analysis:
    # The C5-CH3 group is 'down'.
    # The C6-CH3 group is 'up'.
    # An 'up' and a 'down' substituent on an alicyclic ring are TRANS to each other.
