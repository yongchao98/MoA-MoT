    "The task is to determine the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], from a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻) is represented by the equilibrium:\n    `CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constraint:** The reaction is governed by the dissociation constant, K_d, which is the inverse of the given formation constant, K_f.\n    *   K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    *   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   Therefore, the primary constraint is: `([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻] = 2 x 10⁻¹¹`\n\n3.  **Stoichiometric Constraint:** For every mole of CaY²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of Y⁴⁻ are formed. If we let `x` be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺, then:\n    *   `[Ca²⁺] = x`\n    *   `[Y⁴⁻] = x`\n\n4.  **Mass Balance Constraint:** The total concentration of all calcium-containing species must equal the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex.\n    *   `[CaY²⁻] + [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 M`\n    *   Substituting `x`: `[CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x`\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\n*   **Pruning Rationale:** The formation constant (K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰) is extremely large. This indicates that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction.\n*   **Pruning Action:** Consequently, the amount of dissociation, `x`, will be minuscule compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore apply the simplifying assumption:\n    *   `x << 0.02`\n    *   This simplifies the mass balance constraint to `[CaY²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M`.\n\nThis pruning step allows us to avoid solving a quadratic equation and directly calculate an approximate value for `x`.\n\nApplying the pruned constraint to the equilibrium expression:\n`x * x / 0.02 ≈ 2 x 10⁻¹¹`\n`x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n`x ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\nThis calculated value strongly suggests that candidate A is the correct answer. We will now verify all candidates against the full, un-pruned constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial parameters and constants\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5.0e10\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# Candidate answers\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": 6.3e-7,\n    \"B\": 5.0e-3,\n    \"C\": 2.0e-2,\n    \"D\": 1.0e-2\n}\n\nprint(f\"Target Dissociation Constant (Kd): {Kd:.2e}\\n\")\n\n# Iterate through candidates and check against constraints\nfor name, x in candidates.items():\n    print(f\"--- Checking Candidate {name}: [Ca²⁺] = {x:.2e} M ---\")\n\n    # Constraint 1: Pruning check (x << initial concentration)\n    # A value is considered \"much smaller\" if it's less than 1% of the initial conc.\n    is_much_smaller = x < (0.01 * initial_complex_conc)\n    print(f\"Pruning Constraint ([Ca²⁺] << 0.02 M): {'Pass' if is_much_smaller else 'Fail'}\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: Equilibrium Law Check\n    # [CaY²⁻] = initial_complex_conc - x\n    # We must check if x is less than the initial concentration to avoid math errors.\n    if x >= initial_complex_conc:\n        print(\"Equilibrium Constraint: Fail (Cannot dissociate more than 100%)\\n\")\n        continue\n\n    # Calculate the Kd that would result from this candidate's concentration\n    # Kd_check = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻] = (x * x) / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n    eq_complex_conc = initial_complex_conc - x\n    kd_check = (x**2) / eq_complex_conc\n    \n    # Check if the calculated Kd is close to the true Kd (within 5% relative error)\n    relative_error = abs(kd_check - Kd) / Kd\n    is_equilibrium_satisfied = relative_error < 0.05\n\n    print(f\"Calculated Kd from candidate: {kd_check:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"Equilibrium Constraint (Calculated Kd ≈ Target Kd): {'Pass' if is_equilibrium_satisfied else 'Fail'}\\n\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The analysis and code verification from the previous step have successfully identified the correct answer.\n\n**Summary of Verification:**\n\n1.  **Constraint Modeling:** The problem was modeled as a dissociation equilibrium: `CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`. The key constraint was the dissociation constant, `Kd = 1 / Kf = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹`.\n2.  **Pruning:** The high stability of the complex (large Kf) allowed for the assumption that the dissociation `x` would be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This pruning step immediately pointed towards Candidate A as the only plausible option.\n3.  **Verification:** The Python code tested all candidates against the exact equilibrium equation `Kd = x² / (0.02 - x)`.\n    *   **Candidate A (6.3x10⁻⁷ M):** Produced a calculated `Kd` of `1.98x10⁻¹¹`, which is almost identical to the target `Kd` of `2.0x10⁻¹¹`. This is a pass.\n    *   **Candidates B, C, and D:** Produced `Kd` values that were orders of magnitude different from the target, confirming they are incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports Candidate A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
