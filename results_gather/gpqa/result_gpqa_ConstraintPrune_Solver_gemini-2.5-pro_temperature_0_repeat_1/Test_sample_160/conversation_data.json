    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem by modeling it as a set of constraints.\n\n**Constraint 1: Mathematical Model for Mean Free Path (λ)**\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is defined by the formula:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n**Constraint 2: Modeling λ1 (Gas Molecule Mean Free Path)**\nIn the first scenario, before the electron beam is on, we are considering the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The traveling particles are gas molecules.\n*   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n*   The number density of gas molecules is `n_g`.\n*   The collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule is `σ_gg`.\nTherefore, λ1 is modeled as:\n`λ1 = 1 / (n_g * σ_gg)`\n\n**Constraint 3: Modeling λ2 (Electron Mean Free Path)**\nIn the second scenario, the electron beam is on, and we are considering the mean free path of electrons scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n*   The traveling particles are electrons.\n*   The target particles are the gas molecules.\n*   The number density of the target gas molecules is still `n_g`, as the temperature and pressure of the gas have not changed.\n*   The collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule is `σ_eg`.\nTherefore, λ2 is modeled as:\n`λ2 = 1 / (n_g * σ_eg)`\n\n**Constraint 4: Pruning the Search Space by Comparing λ1 and λ2**\nTo find the relationship between λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n(λ2 / λ1) = [1 / (n_g * σ_eg)] / [1 / (n_g * σ_gg)]\nThe number density `n_g` cancels out, simplifying the relationship to:\n`λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg`\nThis shows that the relationship between the mean free paths is determined entirely by the inverse ratio of their respective collision cross-sections. The problem is now reduced to comparing `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n**Constraint 5: Physical Analysis of Collision Cross-Sections**\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Collision):** This cross-section describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. The interaction is governed by very short-range forces (e.g., van der Waals forces). A collision only occurs when the molecules are physically very close to each other. The cross-section `σ_gg` is therefore related to the physical size (kinetic diameter) of the molecules.\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Collision):** This cross-section describes the scattering of a charged particle (the electron) by a neutral gas molecule. The gas molecule, while overall neutral, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. This creates an electric field. The incoming electron interacts with this electric field via the long-range Coulomb force. Because the force is long-range, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"collide\" or \"scatter\") even when it passes at a considerable distance from the molecule's physical boundary.\n*   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The long-range nature of the electrostatic interaction gives the gas molecule a much larger effective target area for an incoming electron compared to its effective area for another neutral molecule. Therefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section.\n`σ_eg > σ_gg`\n\n**Final Deduction**\nBased on the constraints and analysis:\n1.  We established that `λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg`.\n2.  We determined from physical principles that `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n3.  This means the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` must be less than 1.\n4.  Therefore, `λ2 / λ1 < 1`, which implies `λ2 < λ1`.\n\nAn electron is more likely to interact with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, so the electron's average path between interactions (λ2) will be shorter than the gas molecule's path between interactions (λ1).\n\n---\n**Constraint Pass/Fail Summary:**\n\n*   **Constraint 1 (Model for λ):** Pass. The general formula is correctly applied.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Model for λ1):** Pass. Correctly modeled for gas-gas collisions.\n*   **Constraint 3 (Model for λ2):** Pass. Correctly modeled for electron-gas collisions.\n*   **Constraint 4 (Pruning via Ratio):** Pass. Correctly identified the relationship depends on the cross-sections.\n*   **Constraint 5 (Physical Analysis):** Pass. Correctly determined that the electron-gas cross-section is larger due to long-range forces.\n*   **Final Deduction:** Pass. The logical conclusion `λ2 < λ1` follows directly from the constraints.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
