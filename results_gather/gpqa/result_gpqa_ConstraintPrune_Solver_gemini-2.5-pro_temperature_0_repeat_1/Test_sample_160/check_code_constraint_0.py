    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by verifying its logical steps.

    The problem compares two mean free paths:
    - λ1: For gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.
    - λ2: For electrons colliding with gas molecules.

    The relationship is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is the number density of targets
    and σ is the collision cross-section.

    # than the cross-section for two gas molecules (σ_gg) because the electron's charge
    # leads to a long-range Coulomb interaction, creating a larger "effective target".
