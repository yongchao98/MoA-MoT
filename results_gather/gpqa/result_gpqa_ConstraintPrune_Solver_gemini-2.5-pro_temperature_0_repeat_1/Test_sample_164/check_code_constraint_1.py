While some late transition metal catalysts (e.g., Ni, Pd) can oligomerize ethylene, they typically produce a broad distribution of alpha-olefins. The goal of 'regular branches' requires a highly selective catalyst that produces a single comonomer (like 1-hexene). The catalysts described in statement C are superior for this specific purpose."
