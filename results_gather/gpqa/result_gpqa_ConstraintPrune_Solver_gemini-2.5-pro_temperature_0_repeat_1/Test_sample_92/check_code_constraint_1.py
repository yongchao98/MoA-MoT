            is_B_true = True

    # The difference is consistently 3.3, so statement B is false.

    # C) qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples.
    # This is a general knowledge statement and is scientifically false.

    # --- Step 3: Final Verdict ---
    # We have two factually true statements based on the data: A and D.
    # The question asks for the explanation of the discrepancies.
    # - A (replicate deviation > 0.3) indicates poor precision.
    # - D (inverted trend) indicates a fundamental failure of the experiment or data recording.
    # The error in D is far more significant and invalidates the entire result set.
    # Therefore, D is the best and most critical explanation.
