    Checks the correctness of the given answer about SMEFT symmetries.

    The function encodes the physics principles of SMEFT construction:
    1.  SMEFT is a Lorentz and Poincare invariant theory.
    2.  SMEFT must obey the CPT theorem.
    3.  SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible new physics, including
        new sources of CP violation, so CP is NOT a required symmetry.
