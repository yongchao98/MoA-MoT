    "The user wants to find the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n### Step 1: Define the System and Measurement\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum of electron 1: $l_1 = 1$\n    *   Orbital angular momentum of electron 2: $l_2 = 1$\n    *   Total orbital angular momentum: $l = 2$\n    *   Z-component of total orbital angular momentum: $m = -1$\n*   **Measurement:** We measure the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   **Target Outcome:** We want the probability of finding the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* measurements.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $m_z\\hbar$ for $L_z$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_z$.\n    *   Therefore, the target outcome is the state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This is an uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n### Step 2: Model the Task as Constraints for Pruning\n\nThe probability of this measurement is given by the square of the amplitude of the projection of the initial state onto the target state:\n$P = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nThe term $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are non-zero only if certain selection rules (constraints) are met. We can check these rules to prune the possibilities.\n\n*   **Constraint 1 (m-selection rule):** The total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a fundamental conservation law for the z-component of angular momentum. If this rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\n*   **Constraint 2 (Triangle Inequality):** The total angular momentum quantum number $l$ must satisfy $|l_1 - l_2| \\le l \\le l_1 + l_2$. This is a constraint on which total angular momentum states can be formed from the individual ones.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Constraints to Prune the Search Space\n\nWe will check the constraints for our specific problem.\n\n*   **Candidate Outcome:** The state with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   **Applying Constraint 1:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $M_{total} = -1$.\n    *   For the target outcome, the sum of individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We check if $M_{total} = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   $-1 \\neq -2$.\n    *   The constraint is **violated**.\n\nSince the m-selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero, without needing to perform any further calculations.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this constraint-based pruning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_angular_momentum_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the angular momentum problem as constraints to find the probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Problem Definition ---\n    # Initial coupled state |l1, l2, L, M>\n    l1 = 1\n    l2 = 1\n    L_total = 2\n    M_total = -1\n\n    # Target measurement outcome for L_1z and L_2z\n    # Eigenvalue -hbar corresponds to m = -1\n    m1_target = -1\n    m2_target = -1\n\n    print(f\"Initial state: |l1={l1}, l2={l2}, L={L_total}, M={M_total}>\")\n    print(f\"Target measurement outcome: m1={m1_target}, m2={m2_target}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Constraint Modeling and Pruning ---\n\n    # The candidate is the target measurement outcome.\n    candidate = {'m1': m1_target, 'm2': m2_target}\n    print(f\"Candidate for measurement: {candidate}\")\n\n    # Constraint 1: Conservation of the z-component of angular momentum (m-selection rule).\n    # The state |L, M> is a superposition of |m1, m2> states ONLY where m1 + m2 = M.\n    # If m1_target + m2_target != M_total, the probability of measuring this combination is zero.\n    print(\"\\n--- Constraint 1: M = m1 + m2 ---\")\n    m_sum = candidate['m1'] + candidate['m2']\n    constraint1_pass = (m_sum == M_total)\n    print(f\"Checking if m1 + m2 == M_total: {candidate['m1']} + {candidate['m2']} == {M_total}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {m_sum} == {M_total}\")\n    print(f\"Constraint 1 Pass/Fail: {'PASS' if constraint1_pass else 'FAIL'}\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: Triangle inequality for L.\n    # This is a check on the validity of the initial state itself.\n    print(\"\\n--- Constraint 2: |l1 - l2| <= L <= l1 + l2 ---\")\n    constraint2_pass = (abs(l1 - l2) <= L_total <= l1 + l2)\n    print(f\"Checking if |{l1} - {l2}| <= {L_total} <= {l1} + {l2}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {abs(l1 - l2)} <= {L_total} <= {l1 + l2}\")\n    print(f\"Constraint 2 Pass/Fail: {'PASS' if constraint2_pass else 'FAIL'}\")\n\n    # --- Conclusion from Constraints ---\n    # The probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n    # <l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M>.\n    # This coefficient is non-zero ONLY IF m1 + m2 = M.\n    if not constraint1_pass:\n        probability = 0\n        print(f\"\\nBecause Constraint 1 (m-selection rule) failed, the probability is 0.\")\n    else:\n        # This branch is not reached for this problem.\n        probability = \"Not 0, but requires further calculation.\"\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal calculated probability: {probability}\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nsolve_angular_momentum_probability()\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This state is a superposition of the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. This is expressed by the selection rule:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule acts as a powerful constraint. For any component $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ to be part of the superposition that forms $|l, m\\rangle$, the sum of its individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the amplitude (and thus the probability) of finding the system in that component state is zero.\n\nIn this problem:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The measurement is for the outcome where the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are both $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the uncoupled state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's apply the constraint:\n*   Sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the target outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the system: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not a constituent of the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nBecause the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, leading to a probability of zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
