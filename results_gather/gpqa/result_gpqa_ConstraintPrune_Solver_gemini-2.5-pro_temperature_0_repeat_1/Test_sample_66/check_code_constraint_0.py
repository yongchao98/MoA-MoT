def check_angular_momentum_probability():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the given quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of
    angular momentum for two electrons. The initial state is a coupled state,
    and the measurement projects it onto an uncoupled state.

    The probability of this transition is given by the square of the
    Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the two states. A fundamental
    selection rule for these coefficients is the conservation of the
    z-component of angular momentum: m_total = m1 + m2. If this rule is
    not satisfied, the probability is zero.
