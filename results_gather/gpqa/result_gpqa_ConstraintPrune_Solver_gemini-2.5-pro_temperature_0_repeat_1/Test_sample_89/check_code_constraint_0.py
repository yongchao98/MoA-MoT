    # --- Analysis ---

    # Step 0: Starting Material: 3,4-dimethylhexanedial
    # This is a 1,6-dialdehyde, containing 8 total carbon atoms (6 in chain + 2 methyls).
    # Functional Groups: {'aldehyde', 'aldehyde'}
    # Carbon Count: 8
    
    # Step 1: KOH, H2O, THF, Heat -> Intramolecular Aldol Condensation
    # A 1,6-dialdehyde undergoes intramolecular aldol condensation to form a 5-membered ring.
    # The heat causes dehydration, creating a C=C double bond conjugated with the remaining aldehyde.
    # Product Functional Groups: {'aldehyde', 'alkene'}
    # Carbon Count: 8 (no carbons added or removed)

    # Step 2: CH3CH2MgBr, H3O+ -> Grignard Reaction
    # The ethyl Grignard reagent adds to the aldehyde, which is then protonated by acid workup.
    # The aldehyde is converted to a secondary alcohol. The alkene is unaffected.
    # An ethyl group (2 carbons) is added.
    # Product Functional Groups: {'secondary_alcohol', 'alkene'}
    # Carbon Count: 8 + 2 = 10

    # Step 3: PCC, CH2Cl2 -> Oxidation
    # PCC is a mild oxidant that converts a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The alkene is unaffected.
    # Product Functional Groups: {'ketone', 'alkene'}
    # Carbon Count: 10 (no change)
    # The intermediate is a cyclic enone. A detailed analysis shows the alkene is trisubstituted (of the form R2C=CHR').

    # Step 4: O3, H2O -> Oxidative Ozonolysis
    # This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The H2O workup is oxidative.
    # The more substituted carbon of the alkene (R2C=) becomes a new ketone.
    # The less substituted carbon (=CHR') becomes a carboxylic acid.
    # Final Functional Groups: {'ketone' (original), 'ketone' (new), 'carboxylic_acid'}
    # Final Product Type: Dioxo-carboxylic acid
    # Carbon Count: 10 (no change)
