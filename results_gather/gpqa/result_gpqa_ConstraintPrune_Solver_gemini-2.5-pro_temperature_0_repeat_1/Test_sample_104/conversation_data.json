    "The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl`) relative to its host star's radius (`R_star`) that would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the rotational modulation of a spotted star.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Define Star and Spot Parameters.**\n    *   The star's effective temperature, `T_eff`, is 6000 K.\n    *   The spots have a temperature `T_spot`, which is 1000 K cooler than `T_eff`. So, `T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000` K.\n    *   One hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor `f` of 20% (0.20). The other hemisphere is spotless.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Calculate the Amplitude of Rotational Modulation.**\n    *   The brightness of a star is proportional to its flux. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, flux is proportional to `Area * T^4`. We are interested in the relative change in flux.\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** Occurs when the spotless hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `A_disk * T_eff^4`, where `A_disk` is the projected area of the star's disk.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** Occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction `f` of the disk's area has temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` has temperature `T_eff`. The flux is proportional to `A_disk * [(1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4]`.\n    *   The relative amplitude of the signal is the normalized difference between maximum and minimum flux: `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   This simplifies to: `Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Calculate the Amplitude of a Planetary Transit.**\n    *   For a hypothetical planet transiting a uniform, spotless star, the drop in flux is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`.\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Equate the Amplitudes.**\n    *   The problem requires the two signals to have the same amplitude: `Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_planet`.\n    *   Therefore, `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n    *   Solving for the desired ratio gives: `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4))`.\n\nThis final equation models the entire problem and can be solved by plugging in the known values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constraint 1: Define physical parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # K\nT_spot = 5000.0  # K (T_eff - 1000K)\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\nprint(\"--- Constraint Evaluation ---\")\n\n# Constraint 2: Calculate the amplitude of the spot modulation signal\n# Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\ntemp_ratio_p4 = (T_spot / T_eff)**4\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - temp_ratio_p4)\nprint(f\"Constraint 2 (Spot Signal Amplitude): {amplitude_spot:.6f}\")\nif 0 < amplitude_spot < 1:\n    print(\"PASS: Spot amplitude is a valid fraction.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"FAIL: Spot amplitude is not a valid fraction.\")\n\n# Constraint 3: The planet signal amplitude is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# This is what we need to find.\n\n# Constraint 4: Equate the amplitudes to find the planet-star radius ratio\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spot\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spot)\ntry:\n    r_pl_r_star_sq = amplitude_spot\n    r_pl_r_star = math.sqrt(r_pl_r_star_sq)\n    print(f\"\\nConstraint 4 (Equating Amplitudes):\")\n    print(f\"Required transit depth (R_pl/R_star)^2 = {r_pl_r_star_sq:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated candidate R_pl/R_star = {r_pl_r_star:.6f}\")\n    if r_pl_r_star > 0:\n        print(\"PASS: Calculated radius ratio is a positive number.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"FAIL: Calculated radius ratio is not positive.\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"FAIL: Cannot calculate square root of a negative amplitude.\")\n    r_pl_r_star = -1\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Check Against Options ---\")\noptions = {'A': 0.39, 'B': 0.07, 'C': 0.11, 'D': 0.32}\nbest_option = ''\nmin_diff = float('inf')\n\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    diff = abs(r_pl_r_star - value)\n    if diff < min_diff:\n        min_diff = diff\n        best_option = key\n    print(f\"Option {key} ({value}): Absolute difference = {diff:.6f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {r_pl_r_star:.3f} is closest to option {best_option} ({options[best_option]}).\")\n\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
