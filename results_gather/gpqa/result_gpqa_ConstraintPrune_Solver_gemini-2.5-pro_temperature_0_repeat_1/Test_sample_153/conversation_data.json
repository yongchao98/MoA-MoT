    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Constraint 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\nThe MS data provides the molecular weight and information about isotopic abundance.\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** A peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (for the most abundant isotopes).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of ~32% (100:32 ratio is ~3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl vs ³⁷Cl).\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the candidates:\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one Cl.\n*   B) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one Cl.\n*   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one Cl.\n*   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one Cl.\n\n**Result:** All four candidates match the molecular weight and chlorine presence. This constraint does not prune the search space.\n\n**Constraint 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\nThe IR spectrum gives information about the functional groups present.\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nThe combination of these two peaks is a definitive indicator of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Has an aldehyde and a phenol. Lacks a carboxylic acid.\n*   B) Phenyl chloroformate: Has a carbonyl group but lacks the O-H group.\n*   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Is a carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Is a carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n\n**Result:** This constraint eliminates candidates A and B. The unknown must be either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**Constraint 3: ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides information about the chemical environment and connectivity of protons.\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both remaining candidates (C and D).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) is crucial. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining candidates based on this substitution pattern:\n*   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would produce a more complex pattern with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. It has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n\n**Result:** This constraint eliminates candidate C. Candidate D is the only structure that matches all provided spectral data.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_candidates():\n    candidates = {\n        \"A\": {\"name\": \"3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"func_group\": \"Aldehyde/Phenol\", \"substitution\": \"1,2,3-trisubstituted\"},\n        \"B\": {\"name\": \"Phenyl chloroformate\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"func_group\": \"Chloroformate\", \"substitution\": \"Monosubstituted (ester part)\"},\n        \"C\": {\"name\": \"2-chlorobenzoic acid\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"func_group\": \"Carboxylic Acid\", \"substitution\": \"ortho (1,2)\"},\n        \"D\": {\"name\": \"4-chlorobenzoic acid\", \"mw\": 156.57, \"has_cl\": True, \"func_group\": \"Carboxylic Acid\", \"substitution\": \"para (1,4)\"}\n    }\n\n    # --- Constraint 1: Mass Spec (MW=156, 1 Cl atom) ---\n    print(\"--- Constraint 1: Mass Spec (MW ≈ 156, M+2 peak for 1 Cl) ---\")\n    pass_candidates_1 = []\n    for key, data in candidates.items():\n        # Check for MW ~156 and presence of one chlorine atom\n        if 156 <= data[\"mw\"] < 157 and data[\"has_cl\"]:\n            status = \"Pass\"\n            pass_candidates_1.append(key)\n        else:\n            status = \"Fail\"\n        print(f\"Candidate {key} ({data['name']}): {status}\")\n    print(f\"Candidates remaining: {pass_candidates_1}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Constraint 2: IR (Carboxylic Acid features) ---\n    print(\"--- Constraint 2: IR (Broad O-H ~3000 cm-1, C=O ~1720 cm-1) ---\")\n    pass_candidates_2 = []\n    for key in pass_candidates_1:\n        data = candidates[key]\n        if data[\"func_group\"] == \"Carboxylic Acid\":\n            status = \"Pass\"\n            pass_candidates_2.append(key)\n        else:\n            status = \"Fail\"\n        print(f\"Candidate {key} ({data['name']}): {status}\")\n    print(f\"Candidates remaining: {pass_candidates_2}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Constraint 3: 1H NMR (para-substitution pattern) ---\n    print(\"--- Constraint 3: 1H NMR (Two doublets, 2H each in aromatic region) ---\")\n    final_candidates = []\n    for key in pass_candidates_2:\n        data = candidates[key]\n        # The pattern of two doublets, each 2H, indicates para-substitution\n        if data[\"substitution\"] == \"para (1,4)\":\n            status = \"Pass\"\n            final_candidates.append(key)\n        else:\n            status = \"Fail\"\n        print(f\"Candidate {key} ({data['name']}): {status}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Candidate(s): {final_candidates}\")\n\nanalyze_candidates()\n```\n<<<D>>>",
