    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding solar neutrino flux.

    It models the problem by:
    1. Defining the primary solar neutrino sources with their key properties (flux, energy, origin).
    2. Applying the hypothetical constraint from the question (stopping the pp-III branch).
    3. Calculating the remaining flux in the two specified energy bands.
    4. Determining the ratio of these fluxes.
    5. Comparing the calculated ratio to the provided answer choice 'A'.
