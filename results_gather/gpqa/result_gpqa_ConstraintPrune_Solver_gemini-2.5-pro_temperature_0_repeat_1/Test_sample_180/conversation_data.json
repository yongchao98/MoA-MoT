    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem based on modeling with constraints and pruning the search space.\n\n### Constraint Modeling and Pruning\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands, given a specific, hypothetical change in the Sun's fusion reactions. We can solve this by identifying the sources of neutrinos in each band and then applying the given constraint to see what remains.\n\n**Constraint 1: Identify all potential neutrino sources in the specified energy bands.**\n\nFirst, we must identify which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in our bands of interest under normal conditions. The primary sources are:\n*   **pp-I chain:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n*   **pp-II chain:** Produces `⁷Be` neutrinos via electron capture. This creates two mono-energetic lines, with the dominant one (~90%) at **861 keV**.\n*   **pp-III chain:** Produces `⁸B` neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV (15,000 keV).\n*   **CNO cycle:** Produces `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos with continuous spectra up to 1200 keV and 1730 keV, respectively.\n\nNow, let's check which of these contribute to our two energy bands:\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos: No (max energy 420 keV).\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: No (line is at 861 keV).\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Yes (continuous spectrum covers this range).\n    *   `CNO` neutrinos: Yes (continuous spectra cover this range).\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos: No.\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: **Yes**, the very strong line at 861 keV falls directly in this band.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Yes.\n    *   `CNO` neutrinos: Yes.\n\n**Constraint 2: Apply the problem's hypothetical condition.**\n\nThe problem states: \"the pp-III branch suddenly stopped... while all other reactions remained as they were.\"\n*   The pp-III branch is the sole source of `⁸B` neutrinos.\n*   Therefore, the flux from `⁸B` neutrinos immediately drops to zero.\n*   The fluxes from `⁷Be` and `CNO` neutrinos are unaffected.\n\n**Constraint 3: Prune the sources and re-evaluate the fluxes.**\n\nWith the `⁸B` flux gone, the contributors to each band are now:\n*   **Flux(Band 1: 700-800 keV):** The only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from **CNO neutrinos**.\n*   **Flux(Band 2: 800-900 keV):** The remaining sources are the strong **`⁷Be` line at 861 keV** and the continuous spectrum from **CNO neutrinos**.\n\n**Constraint 4: Compare the magnitudes of the remaining fluxes.**\n\nThe final step is to compare the flux in Band 1 to the flux in Band 2.\n*   Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)\n*   Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(861 keV line) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)\n\nAccording to the Standard Solar Model, the flux of the `⁷Be` line is enormous compared to the flux density of the CNO neutrinos.\n*   The `⁷Be` line flux is approximately 4.5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n*   The total CNO neutrino flux is about 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s, and this is spread over a wide energy range (>1.5 MeV). The flux within a 100 keV window is only a small fraction of this total.\n\nThis means `Flux_⁷Be(861 keV line)` is vastly larger than `Flux_CNO` in either band. Therefore, the denominator is completely dominated by the `⁷Be` flux.\n\nThe ratio is approximately:\nRatio ≈ Flux_CNO(in a 100 keV window) / Flux_⁷Be(861 keV line)\nRatio ≈ (a very small number) / (a very large number)\n\nThis implies the ratio will be very small, much less than 1. An order-of-magnitude estimate places the CNO flux in a 100 keV window at ~10⁷, while the `⁷Be` line flux is ~10⁹. The ratio is therefore on the order of 10⁷/10⁹ = 10⁻², or 0.01.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neutrino_flux_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the solar neutrino flux problem with constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Standard Solar Model approximate fluxes (neutrinos / cm^2 / s)\n    # Source: Bahcall, Serenelli, Basu (2005-2010), rounded for clarity.\n    flux_be7_line_861kev = 4.5e9  # Dominant 7Be line from pp-II\n    flux_b8_total = 5.0e6        # Total 8B flux from pp-III\n    flux_cno_total = 5.0e8       # Combined N and O CNO neutrinos\n\n    # Energy range of CNO neutrinos is roughly 1.7 MeV (1700 keV)\n    cno_energy_range_kev = 1700\n    # Energy window for our bands\n    band_width_kev = 100\n\n    # --- Constraint 1: Initial State ---\n    print(\"--- Constraint 1: Initial State (Normal Sun) ---\")\n    # Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) comes from B8 and CNO\n    # Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) comes from B8, CNO, and the Be7 line\n    print(\"Band 1 (700-800 keV) sources: B-8, CNO.

    "The analysis correctly identified the neutrino sources in each energy band and applied the constraint that the pp-III chain, the source of ⁸B neutrinos, has stopped.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** After the ⁸B flux is removed, the only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle. This results in a relatively low flux.\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** After the ⁸B flux is removed, the remaining sources are the CNO cycle neutrinos and, crucially, the very intense mono-energetic line of ⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV (from the unaffected pp-II chain). This results in a very high flux, dominated by the ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\nThe ratio is therefore a small number (CNO flux) divided by a very large number (⁷Be flux), resulting in a value much less than 1. The calculation confirms the ratio is on the order of 10⁻².\n\n<<<A>>>"
