def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to a chemistry question.
    It verifies the products of two Michael addition reactions.
    The check is performed in two stages:
    1. Atom Conservation: Ensures the molecular formula of the products matches the sum of the reactants.
    2. Structural Plausibility: Verifies that the product structure (as implied by its IUPAC name)
       is the one expected from the reaction mechanism.
