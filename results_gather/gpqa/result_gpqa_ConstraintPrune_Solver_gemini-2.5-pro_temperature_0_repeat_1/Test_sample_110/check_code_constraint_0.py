    # --- Verification of Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile ---> B ---
    # This is a Michael addition reaction.
    # 1. Nucleophile Formation: The base (KOH) deprotonates the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2) to form the nitronate anion (CH3-CH2-CH(-)-NO2).
    # 2. Michael Acceptor: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH3-CH=CH-CN). The electrophilic site is the beta-carbon.
    # 3. C-C Bond Formation: The nucleophilic alpha-carbon of the nitronate attacks the beta-carbon of the nitrile.
    #    - The resulting carbon skeleton is: C-C-C(NO2)-C(CH3)-C-CN.
    # 4. IUPAC Naming of Product B:
    #    - The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.
    #    - The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons, making it a "hexanenitrile".
    #    - Numbering the chain: C6H3-C5H2-C4H(NO2)-C3H(CH3)-C2H2-C1N.
    #    - The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.
    #    - Therefore, the correct name for Product B is "3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile".

    # --- Verification of Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate ---> A ---
    # This is also a Michael addition.
    # 1. Enolate Formation: The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates an alpha-carbon of the ketone.
    #    - The ketone has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.
    #    - C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has NO alpha-protons.
    #    - C6 is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group) and has ONE alpha-proton.
    #    - Therefore, deprotonation can ONLY occur at C6 to form the enolate.
    # 2. C-C Bond Formation: The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.
    #    - The product has a new -CH2-CH2-COOEt group attached to C6 of the ring.
    # 3. IUPAC Naming of Product A (following the convention in the options):
    #    - The main chain is the "ethyl ... propanoate" side chain.
    #    - The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at C3 of the propanoate chain.
    #    - To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (original C6) is numbered C1'.
    #    - Numbering proceeds to give the principal group on the ring (the ketone =O) the lowest possible number. The original C1 (ketone) is adjacent to C6, so it becomes C2'.
    #    - The substituents on the ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.
    #    - The substituent name is "(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)".
    #    - Therefore, the correct name for Product A is "ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate".
