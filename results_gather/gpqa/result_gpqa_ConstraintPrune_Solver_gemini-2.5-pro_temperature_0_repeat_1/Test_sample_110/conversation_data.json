    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions, modeling the task as a set of constraints to prune the search space.\n\n### **Constraint 1: Analyze Reaction B to Halve the Search Space**\n\nReaction B is a Michael addition between a nitronate anion and an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n*   **Reagents:** KOH (base) and H₂O (proton source).\n\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base KOH is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group). This is the most acidic position.\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ (nitronate anion) + H₂O`\n    *   The nucleophile is the carbanion `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-C≡N`. The electrophilic site for conjugate addition is the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   A new bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN  →  CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN`\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate-like anion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n    *   `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN + H₂O  →  CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN + OH⁻`\n\n5.  **IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain: `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n*   **Pruning:** This result for product B matches the name given in options C and D, and contradicts the name in options A and B (`2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`). Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B. The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n### **Constraint 2: Analyze Reaction A to Find the Unique Answer**\n\nReaction A is a Michael addition between a ketone enolate and an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation (Regiochemistry):** The base deprotonates an α-carbon of the ketone.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group) and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can **only** occur at C6. The bulky nature of t-BuOK is irrelevant here as there is no choice of regiochemistry. The enolate forms at C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate, `CH₂=CH-COOEt`. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product, after workup, has an `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:** The product is 6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n5.  **IUPAC Naming of Product A:** The options name the product as a substituted propanoate, where the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. We must follow this convention to match the options.\n    *   Parent chain: `ethyl ... propanoate`.\n    *   Substituent: The cyclohexyl ring, attached at its C6 position to the C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1'. The rest of the ring is numbered to give the principal group (the ketone's C=O) the lowest possible locant.\n    *   Numbering from C1' (old C6) towards the carbonyl group (old C1) gives the C=O the locant C2'.\n    *   Let's identify the substituents on this newly numbered ring:\n        *   A methyl group is on C1' (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   The oxo group (=O) is on C2' (the original C1=O).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are on C3' (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   The name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n*   **Pruning:** This name for product A matches the one in options B and D. The name in options A and C, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, describes a different constitutional isomer where the carbonyl group and attachment point are in a 1,4-relationship, which cannot be formed in this reaction.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nCombining these two correct products leads to option D.\n\n```python\n# Python code to represent the logic and print the results per constraint.\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Analysis of Reaction B ---\n# Reactants: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n# Product B derived: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nproduct_b_derived = \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\noptions_b = {\n    \"A\": \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\",\n    \"B\": \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\",\n    \"C\": \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\",\n    \"D\": \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Analysis of Reaction B ---\")\nprint(f\"Derived Product B: {product_b_derived}\")\ncandidates_after_b = []\nfor option, name in options_b.items():\n    passed = (name == product_b_derived)\n    print(f\"Option {option} for B: '{name}'.
