    Problem:
    An isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e.

    # --- Physical Constants ---

    k = 8.9875517923e9   # Coulomb's constant (k = 1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) in N m^2 C^-2

    # --- Problem Parameters ---
    # Charge of each of the 13 identical particles
    q = 2 * e
    # Radius of the sphere on which 12 charges are constrained
    R = 2.0  # in meters
    # Number of charges on the shell
    N_shell = 12

    # The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two components:
    # 1. The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.
    # 2. The interaction energy among the 12 shell charges themselves.

    # --- Part 1: Energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges ---
    # Each of the 12 shell charges is at a fixed distance R from the central charge.
    # The potential energy for one pair is U = k * q_center * q_shell / R.
    # Since q_center = q_shell = q, and there are 12 such pairs:
    U_center_shell = N_shell * k * q**2 / R

    # --- Part 2: Minimum energy of the 12 shell charges ---
    # To minimize the total energy, the potential energy of the 12 shell charges
    # due to their mutual repulsion must be minimized. This is a classic problem
    # known as the Thomson problem.
    # For N=12, the minimum energy configuration is a regular icosahedron.

    # We need to calculate the sum of potential energies for all pairs of charges
    # on the icosahedron. There are 12*11/2 = 66 pairs in total.
    # The vertices of an icosahedron have three distinct separation distances.

    # The golden ratio, phi, is useful for icosahedral geometry.
    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

    # The edge length 's' of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R is:
    s = 4 * R / math.sqrt(10 + 2 * math.sqrt(5))

    # The three distinct distances between vertices are:
    # d1 = s (edge length)
    # d2 = s * phi (short diagonal across a face)
    # d3 = 2 * R (long diagonal, i.e., the sphere's diameter)

    # The number of pairs at each distance:
    # - Number of edges in an icosahedron = 30. So, 30 pairs at distance 's'.
    # - Number of pairs at distance 's * phi' = 30.
    # - Number of main diagonals = 12/2 = 6. So, 6 pairs at distance '2R'.
    # Total pairs = 30 + 30 + 6 = 66. This is correct.

    # Calculate the shell-shell interaction energy by summing over all pairs:
    U_shell_shell = (30 * k * q**2 / s) + \
                    (30 * k * q**2 / (s * phi)) + \
                    (6 * k * q**2 / (2 * R))
