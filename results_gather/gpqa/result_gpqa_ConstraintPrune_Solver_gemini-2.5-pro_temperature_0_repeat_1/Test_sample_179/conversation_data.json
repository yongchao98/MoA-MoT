    "Answering this question requires modeling the electrostatic potential energy of a system of 13 point charges and finding the configuration that minimizes this energy under the given constraints.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **System Definition:**\n    *   Total particles: 13.\n    *   Charge per particle: `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n    *   The system is isolated, so we only consider internal electrostatic potential energy.\n\n2.  **Geometric Constraints:**\n    *   One central charge (`q_center`) is fixed at a point P. We can set P as the origin of our coordinate system.\n    *   The other 12 charges (`q_shell`) are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\n3.  **Energy Minimization:**\n    *   The total potential energy `U_total` is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges.\n    *   `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`.\n    *   `U_center_shell` is the energy from the interaction of the central charge with the 12 shell charges. Since the distance for each of these 12 pairs is fixed at `R`, this energy term is constant regardless of the arrangement of the shell charges: `U_center_shell = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`.\n    *   `U_shell_shell` is the energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface. To achieve the minimum total energy, these 12 charges must arrange themselves to minimize `U_shell_shell`.\n\n4.  **Pruning the Search Space (Applying Physics Knowledge):**\n    *   The problem of finding the minimum energy configuration of N identical charges on the surface of a sphere is known as the **Thomson problem**.\n    *   For N=12, the unique, mathematically proven ground-state configuration is that the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere. This prunes the infinite possible arrangements of 12 points on a sphere down to a single, known geometric configuration.\n\n### Calculation Strategy\n\nThe total energy can be expressed as:\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * 12 + k * q^2 * Σ_{1≤i<j≤12} (1/r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between shell charges `i` and `j`.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + E_12)`\nwhere `E_12 = R * Σ_{1≤i<j≤12} (1/r_ij)` is the dimensionless energy for the N=12 Thomson problem.\n\nFor an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R, there are three distinct distances between its 12 vertices:\n1.  30 pairs are separated by the edge length `a`.\n2.  30 pairs are separated by the diagonal `a * φ` (where `φ` is the golden ratio).\n3.  6 pairs are antipodal, separated by the diameter `2R`.\n\nThe dimensionless energy `E_12` has a known value, which can be derived from these distances. The value is `E_12 ≈ 49.165253`.\n\nThe final calculation is:\n`U_total = (k * (2e)^2 / R) * (12 + 49.165253)`\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation to find the minimum energy and checks it against the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_charge_energy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum energy of the 13-particle system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constraint 1: Define physical constants and problem parameters\n    k = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant (N·m²/C²)\n    e = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge (C)\n    R = 2.0               # Radius of the sphere (m)\n    q = 2 * e             # Charge of each particle (C)\n\n    # Constraint 2: Determine the dimensionless energy of the shell charges\n    # For N=12 particles on a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is an icosahedron.\n    # The dimensionless energy E_12 = R * sum(1/r_ij) for this configuration is a known value.\n    # It can be derived as E_12 = 15 * phi * sqrt(1 + phi^2) + 3\n    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n    E_12 = 15 * phi * math.sqrt(1 + phi**2) + 3\n    \n    # The total dimensionless energy factor includes the 12 interactions with the central charge.\n    # Each central-shell interaction contributes a dimensionless energy of R/R = 1.\n    total_dimensionless_energy = 12 + E_12\n\n    # Constraint 3: Calculate the final energy\n    # The energy scale factor is k * q^2 / R\n    energy_scale_factor = (k * q**2) / R\n    \n    # The total minimum energy is the product of the scale factor and the dimensionless energy\n    min_energy = energy_scale_factor * total_dimensionless_energy\n    \n    print(f\"Candidate minimum energy: {min_energy:.3e} J\\n\")\n\n    # Constraint 4: Check against provided options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 122.330,\n        \"B\": 2.822e-26,\n        \"C\": 7.056e-27,\n        \"D\": 5.645e-26\n    }\n\n    for label, value in options.items():\n        # Check if the calculated energy is very close to the option value\n        if math.isclose(min_energy, value, rel_tol=1e-3):\n            print(f\"Constraint check for option {label} ({value:.3e} J): PASS\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Constraint check for option {label} ({value:.3e} J): FAIL\")\n\nsolve_charge_energy()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
