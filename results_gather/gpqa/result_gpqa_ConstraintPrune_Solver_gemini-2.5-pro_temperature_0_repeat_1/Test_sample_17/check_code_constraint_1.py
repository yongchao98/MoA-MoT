    # --- Calculation ---
    # The goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.
    # This is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon number densities relative to hydrogen:
    # Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2

    # Step 1: Find [Si/H] for Star 1 using the property [A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]
    # [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1
    # Rearranging for [Si/H]_1:
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = given_Si_Fe_1 + given_Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Find [Si/H] for Star 2 using the same property
    # [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging for [Si/H]_2:
    # [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = given_Mg_H_2 - given_Mg_Si_2

    # Step 3: Relate the [Si/H] values to the desired ratio
    # By definition:
    # [Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )
    # [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )
    #
    # Subtracting the second equation from the first, the solar abundance term cancels out:
    # [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_2 )
    # [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 )
    log_of_the_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final ratio by taking the antilog (10^x)
    calculated_ratio = 10**log_of_the_ratio

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated ratio is approximately equal to the value from the chosen answer.
    # We use a relative tolerance to account for the "~" (approximately) in the answer option.
    # A 5% tolerance is reasonable for this kind of approximation.
