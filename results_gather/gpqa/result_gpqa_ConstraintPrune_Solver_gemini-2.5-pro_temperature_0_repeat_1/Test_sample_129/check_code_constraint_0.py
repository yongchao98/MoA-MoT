    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the quasar redshift problem.

    The problem is to find the lower limit on the redshift (z) for the
    Lyman-alpha line (rest wavelength ~1216 A) to be observable by a
    ground-based optical telescope. The key constraint is the atmospheric
    cutoff, which prevents light below ~3500 A from reaching the ground.
