    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the astrophysics question.

    The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift (z) for a Lyman-alpha (Lyα)
    absorption line to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the rest wavelength of the Lyα line.
    2. Define the key constraint: the minimum observable wavelength for a ground-based
       optical telescope due to atmospheric absorption (the "atmospheric cutoff").
       This is typically in the range of 3200-3800 Angstroms. A value of ~3500 Å is a
       reasonable and common practical limit.
    3. The "lower limit on the redshift" corresponds to the redshift that shifts the
       Lyα line to be just above this atmospheric cutoff.
    4. The code will check which of the given options represents the smallest redshift
       that results in an observable wavelength.
