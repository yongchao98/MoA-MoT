    # --- Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence ---

    # Starting materials:
    # Propionaldehyde: CH3-CH2-CHO
    # Reagents for step 5: 3-bromopentane, PPh3, BuLi

    # Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 -> A
    # This is the formation of a cyclic thioacetal (a 1,3-dithiolane) to protect the aldehyde.
    # Product A: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The C2 carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a hydrogen.

    # Step 2: A + BuLi -> B
    # BuLi is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one at C2, between the two sulfur atoms.
    # Product B: A lithiated carbanion at C2 of the dithiolane ring.

    # Step 3: B + Bromoethane -> C
    # The carbanion (nucleophile) attacks bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to C2.
    # Product C: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.

    # Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ -> D
    # This is the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal, regenerating a carbonyl group.
    # Product D: Diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone. Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

    # Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi -> E
    # This is a Wittig reaction.
    # First, the Wittig ylide is formed: 3-bromopentane reacts with PPh3, and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi.
    # Ylide from 3-bromopentane: (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.
    # The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).
    # The C=O of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.
    # Ketone D: (CH3CH2)2C=O
    # Ylide: (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3
    # Product E: (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2

    # --- 13C-NMR analysis of the final product E ---

    # The structure of E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.
    # Let's analyze its symmetry to find the number of unique carbon signals.
    # Structure:
    #      CH2-CH3
    #     /
    # CH3-CH2-C=C-CH2-CH3
    #          \
    #           CH2-CH3
    #
    # The molecule is highly symmetrical with a C2 axis and a plane of symmetry through the double bond.
    # We can identify three distinct types of carbon atoms:
    # 1. Alkene carbons: The two carbons forming the C=C double bond are identical due to symmetry. This gives 1 signal.
    # 2. Methylene carbons (-CH2-): All four methylene carbons in the four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent. This gives 1 signal.
    # 3. Methyl carbons (-CH3): All four methyl carbons are also chemically equivalent. This gives 1 signal.

    # Total number of signals = 1 (alkene) + 1 (methylene) + 1 (methyl) = 3.
    calculated_signals = 3

    # --- Compare with the provided answer ---
    
    # The provided answer is 'C'.
    # The options are: A) 8, B) 6, C) 3, D) 11.
    # So, answer 'C' corresponds to 3 signals.
    llm_answer_value = 3

        return "Correct"
