    "The task is to identify the set of assumptions that jointly define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that a nucleon bound within a nucleus behaves like a free nucleon during a high-energy interaction. We can model this by establishing constraints based on the physical meaning of the approximation and then pruning the available options.\n\n**Constraint 1: The interaction must be with a single nucleon.**\nThe impulse approximation simplifies a complex many-body problem into a sum of single-body interactions. This requires the interaction probe to couple to individual nucleons, not pairs or clusters. This directly corresponds to assumption #1.\n\n**Constraint 2: The nucleon must be \"free\" during the interaction.**\nThe name \"impulse\" implies the interaction happens over a timescale much shorter than the characteristic time of the nuclear forces binding the nucleon. Therefore, during the interaction, the nucleon can be treated as if it is free from the nuclear potential. This is the essence of assumption #4.\n\n**Constraint 3: The initial and final states must be simple.**\nFor the experimental result to be interpreted as a clean interaction with a single, free-like nucleon, we must assume that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without prior interaction and that the struck nucleon (and other products) leaves the nucleus without subsequent interactions (Final State Interactions, or FSI). This is encapsulated by assumption #2, which states the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\".\n\n**Constraint 4: The internal structure of the nucleon is a separate issue.**\nAssumption #3, regarding non-relativistic quarks, is an approximation about the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's behavior *as a constituent of the nucleus*. One can apply the impulse approximation in regimes where the quarks are highly relativistic (e.g., deep inelastic scattering). Therefore, assumption #3 is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\nWe will now apply these constraints to prune the candidate list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_impulse_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the impulse approximation problem as a set of constraints\n    and prunes the candidates to find the correct set of assumptions.\n    \"\"\"\n    candidates = {\n        'A': {'assumptions': {1, 3, 4}, 'is_valid': True},\n        'B': {'assumptions': {1, 2, 4}, 'is_valid': True},\n        'C': {'assumptions': {2, 3, 4}, 'is_valid': True},\n        'D': {'assumptions': {1, 2, 3}, 'is_valid': True}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Initial candidates:\", [k for k, v in candidates.items() if v['is_valid']])\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Constraint 1: The approximation requires treating the nucleon as if it's free from binding forces.\n    # This is the definition of assumption #4.\n    constraint_1_desc = \"Constraint 1 (Requires #4): Nucleon treated as free from binding forces.\"\n    print(constraint_1_desc)\n    for name, data in candidates.items():\n        passes = 4 in data['assumptions']\n        if not passes and data['is_valid']:\n            data['is_valid'] = False\n        print(f\"  Candidate {name}: {'Pass' if passes else 'Fail'}\")\n    print(\"Candidates remaining:\", [k for k, v in candidates.items() if v['is_valid']])\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Constraint 2: The approximation assumes the interaction is with a single nucleon.\n    # This is the definition of assumption #1.\n    constraint_2_desc = \"Constraint 2 (Requires #1): Interaction is with a single nucleon.\"\n    print(constraint_2_desc)\n    for name, data in candidates.items():\n        if data['is_valid']:\n            passes = 1 in data['assumptions']\n            if not passes:\n                data['is_valid'] = False\n            print(f\"  Candidate {name}: {'Pass' if passes else 'Fail'}\")\n    print(\"Candidates remaining:\", [k for k, v in candidates.items() if v['is_valid']])\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Constraint 3: The approximation requires neglecting initial and final state interactions.\n    # This is the definition of assumption #2.
