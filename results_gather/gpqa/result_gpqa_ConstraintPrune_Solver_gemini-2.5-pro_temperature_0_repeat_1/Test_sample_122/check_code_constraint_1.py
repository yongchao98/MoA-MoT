    # Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)
    # beta is the ratio of velocity to the speed of light.
    beta = v / c
    # The Lorentz factor formula.
    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)

    # This is the time dilation formula: t = gamma * t'

    # Distance = velocity * time (using the time from the Galaxy's perspective)
    calculated_distance = v * t_galaxy_frame

    # than the non-relativistic (classical) distance.
