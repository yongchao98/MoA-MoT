    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled (`d`) and the time elapsed (`Δt`) in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. We are given the time elapsed in this frame (`Δt'`), which is the proper time.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Variables:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in ejecta frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Formulate Physical Constraints (Equations):**\n    *   The core principle is **time dilation**. The time measured in the stationary frame (S) is longer than the proper time measured in the moving frame (S').\n    *   The relationship is given by `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (S) is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\nBefore performing the full calculation, we can significantly prune the options.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Relativistic effects must be considered.** The velocity `v = 60,000 km/s` is 20% of the speed of light (`v/c = 0.2`). This is a significant fraction, so relativistic effects are important.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: The Lorentz factor `γ` must be greater than 1.** For any `v > 0`, the term `v²/c²` is positive, `1 - v²/c²` is less than 1, and `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` will be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Time in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) must be greater than the time in the ejecta frame (`Δt'`).** Since `Δt = γ * Δt'` and `γ > 1`, it follows that `Δt > Δt'`. So, more than 50 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   **Constraint 4: The calculated distance `d` must be greater than the non-relativistic distance.** The non-relativistic distance would be calculated by incorrectly using the proper time `Δt'`: `d_non-relativistic = v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. Since the actual time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is longer than 50 s, the actual distance `d = v * Δt` must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n*   **Applying the Pruning:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km (< 3,000,000 km) -> Fails\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km (> 3,000,000 km) -> Passes\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (= 3,000,000 km) -> Fails (This is the non-relativistic answer)\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km (< 3,000,000 km) -> Fails\n\nThis logical pruning process eliminates all options except for B, identifying it as the correct answer without needing to calculate the exact Lorentz factor. We will now verify this with a full calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Variables and Constants ---\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s (proper time in ejecta frame)\nc = 299792.458 # km/s (standard value for speed of light)\n# Using c = 300000 km/s is also a common approximation for such problems.\n# Let's use the more precise value for accuracy.\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 2880000,\n    \"B\": 3060000,\n    \"C\": 3000000,\n    \"D\": 2940000\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Constraint Checks and Calculation ---\")\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Calculate v/c ratio ---\nv_c_ratio = v / c\nprint(f\"Constraint 1: v/c ratio = {v_c_ratio:.4f}.

    "Excellent. The code execution confirms the initial pruning logic.\n\n1.  **Initial Pruning:** We established that the relativistic distance must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This immediately eliminated options A, C, and D, leaving only B as a plausible candidate.\n\n2.  **Calculation Verification:** The Python code performed the full special relativity calculation:\n    *   It calculated the Lorentz factor `γ` to be approximately `1.0206`.\n    *   It used this to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame: `Δt = γ * Δt' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n    *   Finally, it calculated the distance in the Galaxy's frame: `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,950 km`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The calculated distance of `3,061,950 km` is extremely close to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options or using an approximate value for the speed of light (e.g., 300,000 km/s exactly, which would yield `3,061,224 km`). In either case, B is clearly the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
