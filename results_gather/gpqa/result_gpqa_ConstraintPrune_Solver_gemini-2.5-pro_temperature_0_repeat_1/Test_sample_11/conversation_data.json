    "The task is to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the two product particles, the positive muon (mu+) and the muon neutrino (nu), from the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+).\n\nThis problem can be modeled using two fundamental physical laws as constraints:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nWe will use these constraints to prune the given options.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Particle: Pi(+)\n    *   Status: Stationary (at rest)\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial): Rest Energy = m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Total Momentum (p_initial): 0\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Particles: mu(+) + nu\n    *   Total Energy (E_final): E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu*c²) + (KE_nu + m_nu*c²)\n    *   Total Momentum (p_final): p_mu + p_nu\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Energy Conservation (E_initial = E_final)**\n    *   m_pi*c² = (KE_mu + m_mu*c²) + KE_nu  *(Assuming the neutrino is massless, m_nu = 0)*\n    *   139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu\n    *   This simplifies to: **KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV**.\n    *   This value, the total kinetic energy of the products, is the Q-value of the decay.

    "Excellent. The code executed correctly and successfully identified the correct answer by applying the physical constraints. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning.\n\n### Analysis of the Solution\n\nThe problem was modeled using two fundamental principles of physics, which act as powerful constraints to eliminate incorrect options.\n\n**Constraint 1: Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   **Principle:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Application:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy (139.6 MeV). After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu).\n    *   `E_initial = m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   `E_final = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu*c²) + KE_nu` (assuming a massless neutrino)\n*   **Derivation:** Setting `E_initial = E_final` gives:\n    `139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\n*   **Evaluation:** The code correctly calculated this required sum (the Q-value) as 33.9 MeV. As the output shows, only Candidate A has two kinetic energies that sum to this value (4.12 + 29.8 = 33.92 MeV). All other candidates failed this check, effectively pruning the search space to a single option.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Principle:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Application:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products must have equal and opposite momenta to keep the total momentum zero. This means their momentum magnitudes must be equal: `|p_mu| = |p_nu|`.\n*   **Derivation:** The code checked this by comparing the square of the momentum for each particle in Candidate A.\n    *   For the massless neutrino: `p_nu*c = KE_nu`. So, `(p_nu*c)² = (29.8)² ≈ 888.04 MeV²`.\n    *   For the massive muon, using the relativistic formula `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`: `(p_mu*c)² = (KE_mu + m_mu*c²)² - (m_mu*c²)² = (4.12 + 105.7)² - (105.7)² ≈ 887.94 MeV²`.\n*   **Evaluation:** The calculated momentum-squared values (888.04 and 887.94) are virtually identical, confirming that Candidate A also satisfies the conservation of momentum.\n\nThe combination of these two constraints uniquely and definitively identifies the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
