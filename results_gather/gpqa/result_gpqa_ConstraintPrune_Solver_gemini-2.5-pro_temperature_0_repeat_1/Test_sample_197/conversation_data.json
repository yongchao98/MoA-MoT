    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution by modeling the problem as a set of constraints.\n\n**Constraint Modeling**\n\n1.  **Species in Solution:** The species containing cobalt are the free aquated ion `Co^2+` and the thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: Mass Balance on Cobalt:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)_total`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species.\n    `c(Co)_total = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Ligand Concentration (Pruning Step):** The total cobalt concentration (`10^-2 M`) is significantly lower than the thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`). This allows us to prune the complexity of the problem by assuming that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium, `[SCN-]`, is approximately equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n    This avoids solving a high-order polynomial for the exact equilibrium concentration of `[SCN-]`.\n\n4.  **Constraint 3: Fraction of a Species (α):** The percentage of any single cobalt species is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in `α2`, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)_total`\n\n    Using the stability constants (β) and Constraint 2, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n    Substituting these into the mass balance equation (Constraint 1) and factoring out `[Co^2+]` gives:\n    `c(Co)_total = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Now, we can write the formula for the fraction `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known stability constants and the approximated ligand concentration:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThe following code implements this derived formula to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Known values from the problem statement\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\nco_total_conc = 1e-2 # Not needed for percentage calculation but good for context\n\n# Constraint 2: Ligand concentration is approximated as constant\nL = scn_conc\n\n# Calculate each term in the denominator of the fraction formula (alpha_2)\n# This corresponds to the relative amount of each species\nterm0 = 1  # for free Co^2+\nterm1 = beta1 * (L**1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (L**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (L**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (L**4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all relative amounts\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_of_CoSCN2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"Candidate percentage: {percentage_of_CoSCN2:.1f}%\")\n\n# --- Constraint Verification ---\n# Constraint 1: Mass Balance on Cobalt.\n# The formula for alpha is derived directly from this constraint.\nprint(\"Constraint 1 (Mass Balance): Pass (Formula is derived from this principle)\")\n\n# Constraint 2: Ligand Concentration Approximation.\n# The calculation relies on the assumption that [SCN-] is constant at 0.1 M.\n# This is a standard and necessary simplification for this type of problem.\nprint(\"Constraint 2 (Ligand Concentration Approximation): Pass (Standard simplifying assumption for [Ligand] >> [Metal])\")\n\n# Constraint 3: Final Answer Check.\n# The calculated percentage must match one of the options.\noptions = {'A': 38.1, 'B': 25.6, 'C': 42.3, 'D': 16.9}\nmatch_found = False\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(percentage_of_CoSCN2, value, rel_tol=1e-2):\n        print(f\"Constraint 3 (Final Answer Check): Pass (Calculated value {percentage_of_CoSCN2:.1f}% matches option {option})\")\n        match_found = True\n        break\nif not match_found:\n    print(\"Constraint 3 (Final Answer Check): Fail (Calculated value does not match any option)\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>",
