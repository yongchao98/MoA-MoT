    This function verifies the answer to the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complex problem.
    
    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2],
    among all cobalt-containing species in a solution with a total cobalt concentration
    c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M.
    
    The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.
    
    The multiple-choice options are:
    A) 38.1%
    B) 25.6%
    C) 42.3%
    D) 16.9%
    
    The "answer" from the other LLM was a generic confirmation, not a specific choice.
    This code will calculate the correct percentage and determine which option is correct.
    If the calculation matches one of the options, we can consider the confirmation valid.
