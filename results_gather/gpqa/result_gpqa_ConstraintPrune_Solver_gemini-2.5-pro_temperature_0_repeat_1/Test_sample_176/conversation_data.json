    "Here is the breakdown of the problem modeled as a set of constraints.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **Radius Relationship:** `Radius_Star_1 = 1.5 * Radius_Star_2`. This is a primary constraint for calculating luminosity.\n2.  **Mass Relationship:** `Mass_Star_1 = 1.5 * Mass_Star_2`. This information is related to stellar evolution and structure but is not directly required for calculating luminosity from radius and temperature. This constraint will be pruned.\n3.  **Peak Emission Wavelength:** `λ_max_Star_1 = λ_max_Star_2`. According to Wien's Displacement Law (`λ_max = b / T`, where T is temperature and b is a constant), this implies that `Temperature_Star_1 = Temperature_Star_2`. This is a critical constraint.\n4.  **Radial Velocity:** `v_rad_Star_1 = 0 km/s`, `v_rad_Star_2 = 700 km/s`. This information relates to the stars' motion relative to the observer (Doppler effect) but does not affect their intrinsic total luminosity. This constraint will be pruned.\n5.  **Black Body Radiation:** The stars radiate as black bodies. This allows us to use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for luminosity: `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`, where L is luminosity, R is radius, T is surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**Pruning and Search Space Reduction:**\n\n*   The core task is to find the ratio `L1 / L2`.\n*   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1^2 * σ * T1^4) / (4 * π * R2^2 * σ * T2^4)`.\n*   The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the ratio to: `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4`.\n*   From Constraint 1, we know `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n*   From Constraint 3 (Wien's Law), we know `T1 = T2`, so `T1 / T2 = 1`.\n*   The mass and radial velocity information (Constraints 2 and 4) are not needed for this calculation and are therefore pruned.\n*   The problem is reduced to calculating `(1.5)^2 * (1)^4`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the known ratios and values as constraints\n# Constraint 1: Radius ratio\nR1_div_R2 = 1.5\n# Constraint 2: Mass ratio (will be pruned)\nM1_div_M2 = 1.5\n# Constraint 3: Peak wavelengths are equal, implying equal temperatures\nT1_div_T2 = 1.0\n# Constraint 4: Radial velocities (will be pruned)\nv1 = 0  # km/s\nv2 = 700 # km/s\n\n# The problem is to find the luminosity ratio L1 / L2.\n# The governing equation from the Stefan-Boltzmann law is:\n# L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n\n# --- Constraint Verification and Calculation ---\n\n# Candidate calculation\ncandidate_ratio = (R1_div_R2)**2 * (T1_div_T2)**4\n\nprint(f\"Candidate luminosity ratio L1/L2: {candidate_ratio:.2f}\\n\")\n\n# Final check per constraint\nprint(\"--- Constraint Pass/Fail ---\")\n\n# Constraint 1: Radius ratio is used.\nprint(f\"Constraint 1 (Radius Ratio = {R1_div_R2}): Pass (Used in calculation)\")\n\n# Constraint 2: Mass ratio is not used.\nprint(f\"Constraint 2 (Mass Ratio = {M1_div_M2}): Pass (Pruned as irrelevant for luminosity calculation)\")\n\n# Constraint 3: Equal peak wavelengths imply equal temperatures.\nprint(f\"Constraint 3 (Temperature Ratio = {T1_div_T2}): Pass (Used in calculation)\")\n\n# Constraint 4: Radial velocities are not used.\nprint(f\"Constraint 4 (Velocities = {v1}, {v2} km/s): Pass (Pruned as irrelevant for intrinsic luminosity)\")\n\n# Constraint 5: Black body radiation assumption is used.\nprint(\"Constraint 5 (Black Body Radiation): Pass (Used to select Stefan-Boltzmann Law)\")\n\n# Check against options\noptions = {'A': 2.23, 'B': 2.35, 'C': 2.25, 'D': 2.32}\nmatch_found = False\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(candidate_ratio, value, rel_tol=1e-5):\n        print(f\"\\nFinal check: Candidate {candidate_ratio:.2f} matches option {key} ({value}).\")\n        match_found = True\n        break\nif not match_found:\n    print(\"\\nFinal check: Candidate does not match any option.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
