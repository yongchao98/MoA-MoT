    "An organic moiety (molecule) shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common conditions that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (like in atropisomers). A molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and thus not optically active.\n\n**Constraint 1: Presence of a Chiral Center**\nA chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral.\n\n**Constraint 2: Presence of Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism)**\nIn some molecules, like substituted biphenyls, free rotation around a single bond is restricted by bulky groups. If this restricted rotation leads to a stable, non-planar conformation that is non-superimposable on its mirror image, the molecule is chiral. This is known as atropisomerism.\n\n**Constraint 3: Absence of Symmetry Elements**\nA molecule is achiral (not optically active) if it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, even if it contains chiral centers (as in a meso compound).\n\nWe will now prune the list of compounds by applying these constraints.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism based on structural constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"1\": {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"has_chiral_center\": False,\n                \"is_biphenyl_with_ortho_bulk\": True, # Bulky groups: -NO2 and -COOCH3 at 2,2',6,6'\n                \"has_plane_of_symmetry\": False,\n                \"has_center_of_inversion\": False\n            }\n        },\n        \"2\": {\n            \"name\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"has_chiral_center\": True, # C2 is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3\n                \"is_biphenyl_with_ortho_bulk\": False,\n                \"has_plane_of_symmetry\": False,\n                \"has_center_of_inversion\": False\n            }\n        },\n        \"3\": {\n            \"name\": \"benzophenone\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"has_chiral_center\": False,\n                \"is_biphenyl_with_ortho_bulk\": False,\n                \"has_plane_of_symmetry\": True, # Plane bisects the C=O bond\n                \"has_center_of_inversion\": False\n            }\n        },\n        \"4\": {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl fumarate\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"has_chiral_center\": False,\n                \"is_biphenyl_with_ortho_bulk\": False,\n                \"has_plane_of_symmetry\": True, # The molecular plane itself\n                \"has_center_of_inversion\": True # At the center of the C=C bond\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    final_candidates = []\n\n    print(\"--- Analyzing Candidates for Optical Isomerism ---\")\n\n    for key, data in compounds.items():\n        name = data[\"name\"]\n        analysis = data[\"analysis\"]\n        is_chiral = False\n\n        print(f\"\\nCompound {key}: {name}\")\n\n        # Constraint 1: Chiral Center\n        if analysis[\"has_chiral_center\"]:\n            print(\"Constraint (Chiral Center): Pass - Molecule contains a chiral center.\")\n            is_chiral = True\n        else:\n            print(\"Constraint (Chiral Center): Fail - Molecule does not contain a classic chiral center.\")\n\n        # Constraint 2: Atropisomerism\n        if analysis[\"is_biphenyl_with_ortho_bulk\"]:\n            print(\"Constraint (Atropisomerism): Pass - Molecule exhibits axial chirality due to hindered rotation.\")\n            is_chiral = True\n        else:\n            # This check is only relevant for specific structures, so failing it isn't a final fail.\n            pass\n\n        # Constraint 3: Overriding Symmetry (Pruning Step)\n        if analysis[\"has_plane_of_symmetry\"] or analysis[\"has_center_of_inversion\"]:\n            reason = \"a plane of symmetry\" if analysis[\"has_plane_of_symmetry\"] else \"a center of inversion\"\n            print(f\"Constraint (Symmetry): Fail - Molecule is achiral because it possesses {reason}.\")\n            is_chiral = False # Symmetry overrides other factors\n        else:\n            if is_chiral:\n                 print(\"Constraint (Symmetry): Pass - Molecule lacks overriding symmetry elements.\")\n\n        # Final Verdict\n        if is_chiral:\n            print(f\"Final Verdict for {key}: PASS - Shows optical isomerism.\")\n            final_candidates.append(key)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Final Verdict for {key}: FAIL - Does not show optical isomerism.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Summary ---\")\n    if final_candidates:\n        print(f\"The compounds that show optical isomerism are: {', '.join(final_candidates)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No compounds were found to show optical isomerism.\")\n\nanalyze_optical_isomerism()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The analysis is complete and has been confirmed as correct.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule has a stereocenter. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. Since it possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
