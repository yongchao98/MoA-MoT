def check_optical_isomerism_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer regarding optical isomerism for four compounds.
    
    An organic molecule is optically active if it is chiral.
    A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.
    Key indicators for chirality:
    - Presence of a chiral center (e.g., a carbon with 4 different substituents).
    - Axial chirality (atropisomerism), e.g., in hindered biphenyls.
    
    Key indicators for achirality (not optically active):
    - Presence of a plane of symmetry.
    - Presence of a center of inversion.
    The presence of any of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.
