    # --- Define Facts and Constraints from the Question ---

    # 1. Genetic Construct Details
    # The CBA promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter containing its own enhancer.
    # It drives transcription in most cell types, including neural crest derivatives.
    promoter_has_enhancer = True

    # The length of a standard lox site (loxP, lox2272, etc.) is 34 base pairs.
    # After Cre-mediated excision, one lox site remains as a "scar".
    lox_scar_length_bp = 34

    # 2. Experimental Observation
    # The key observation is a complete lack of the green signal.
    observation = "no_eGFP_signal"

    # --- Evaluate Each Option Based on the Facts ---

    # Option A: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.
    def check_A():
        if promoter_has_enhancer:
            return False, "This is incorrect. The CBA promoter is a composite promoter that contains its own strong enhancer elements, making it active in a wide range of cells, including those of the neural lineage. A missing enhancer is not the likely cause."
        return True, ""

    # Option B: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.
    def check_B():
        # For a fusion protein to be made correctly after recombination, the scar's length must be a multiple of 3.
        # A codon is 3 base pairs. Any other length will shift the reading frame.
        is_in_frame = (lox_scar_length_bp % 3) == 0
        
        if not is_in_frame:
            # A frameshift mutation scrambles the amino acid sequence and almost always introduces a premature stop codon.
            # This would prevent the translation of a functional eGFP protein, perfectly explaining a total lack of signal.
            return True, "The lox2272 scar left after recombination is 34 bp long. Since 34 is not divisible by 3, it causes a frameshift mutation. This scrambles the eGFP's amino acid sequence and introduces premature stop codons, preventing its translation and fluorescence. This is the most direct and definitive cause for the observed lack of signal."
        return False, "This would be incorrect if the lox scar length were a multiple of 3."

    # Option C: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.
    def check_C():
        # Golgi retention implies the protein IS synthesized but fails to traffic correctly.
        # While possible, this would likely result in a mislocalized signal (e.g., perinuclear), not a complete absence of signal.
        # A translation failure (like a frameshift) is a more fundamental error that better explains a total lack of signal.
        return False, "This is less likely. If the protein were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized and tagged with eGFP. It would likely be visible with a confocal microscope, just mislocalized within the cell. The problem states NO green signal was observed, which points to a more fundamental failure in protein synthesis, not trafficking."

    # Option D: Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.
    def check_D():
        # The mode of signaling (paracrine vs. autocrine) describes the interaction between cells AFTER the proteins are made, expressed, and secreted/presented.
        # It has no bearing on the initial synthesis of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein inside the cell.
        return False, "This is incorrect. The mode of signaling (paracrine) is irrelevant to the question of whether the receptor-eGFP protein is synthesized in the first place. Protein synthesis precedes cell-cell interaction."
