    # --- Problem Setup ---
    # Construct: Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP
    # Recombinase: Cre is present in SOX10-expressing cells.
    # Observation: No green signal (eGFP fluorescence).
    llm_answer = "B"

    # --- Analysis of Options ---

    # Option A: Missing enhancer
    # The CBA promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. A complete lack of expression is unlikely.
    # This is a less probable cause than a fundamental flaw in the construct design.
    is_A_correct = False
    reason_A = "The CBA promoter is strong and constitutive; it does not typically require a specific enhancer to drive expression. A complete lack of signal points to a more fundamental issue like a translation error."

    # Option B: Frameshift
    # Cre-mediated excision of a lox-flanked cassette leaves a scar (one lox site).
    # A lox site (including lox2272) is 34 base pairs long.
    # 34 is not divisible by 3 (34 % 3 != 0).
    # This will cause a frameshift mutation between the Receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF.
    # A frameshift prevents the correct translation of the eGFP protein, resulting in no fluorescence.
    # This perfectly matches the observation.
    is_B_correct = True
    reason_B = "This is the most plausible reason. Cre-mediated excision leaves a lox2272 scar of 34 bp. Since 34 is not a multiple of 3, it induces a frameshift, preventing the correct translation of the downstream eGFP protein and thus explaining the complete absence of a green signal."

    # Option C: Golgi retention
    # If the protein was synthesized but retained in the Golgi, it would still be fluorescent.
    # The observation would be a mislocalized green signal, not a complete absence of signal.
    # This contradicts the problem statement.
    is_C_correct = False
    reason_C = "This is incorrect because if the protein were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be fluorescent. The observation would be a green signal localized to the Golgi, which contradicts the stated observation of 'no green signal'."

    # Option D: Paracrine relationship
    # The signaling mechanism (paracrine vs. autocrine) is a biological property.
    # It does not affect the molecular process of transcription and translation of the reporter construct.
    # This option is irrelevant to the observed molecular outcome.
    is_D_correct = False
    reason_D = "This is incorrect because the biological relationship between the ligand and receptor is irrelevant to the successful transcription and translation of the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein from the engineered construct."
