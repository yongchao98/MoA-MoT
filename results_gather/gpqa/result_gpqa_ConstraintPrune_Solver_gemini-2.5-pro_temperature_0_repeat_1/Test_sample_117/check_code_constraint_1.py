    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the chemistry question.

    The reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br2).
    This is a classic alpha-halogenation of a ketone (via its enol tautomer).

    The chemical rules are as follows:
    1.  Keto-Enol Tautomerism & Reaction Type: The enol reactant is in equilibrium with its keto tautomer, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The reaction with Br2 is an alpha-substitution, not an addition reaction. Therefore, the final product must be a ketone, not an alcohol. The stable C=O bond is reformed.
    2.  Regioselectivity: The substitution occurs at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). In 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the carbonyl group is at C1. The alpha-carbons are C2 and C5. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these positions are equivalent. Therefore, the bromine must be attached to C2 (or C5).
