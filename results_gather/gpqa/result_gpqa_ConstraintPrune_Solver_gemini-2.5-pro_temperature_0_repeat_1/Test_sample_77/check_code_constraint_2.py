    # from the origin, which is the formula for a static charge at the origin.

    # The denominator term (dc +/- d_vec . v) accounts for the Doppler effect. For a charge moving
    # towards the observer, the potential's magnitude should increase, which requires the denominator
    # to decrease. This happens when the sign is negative: (dc - d_vec . v).
