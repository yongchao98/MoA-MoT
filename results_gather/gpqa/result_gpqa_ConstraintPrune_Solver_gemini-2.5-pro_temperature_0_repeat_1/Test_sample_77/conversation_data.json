The denominator (dc + d.v) has the incorrect sign. The correct factor derived from the retarded time calculation is (dc - d.v).\nCandidate C: Pass. The denominator (dc - d.v) has the correct sign, corresponding to the standard derivation of Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\nRemaining candidates: ['C']\n\n\nErrors: \nChecker feedback:\noutput: Reason for incorrectness: Constraint 2 (Static Limit) failed for A.

    "Code output: Initial candidates: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n\n--- Constraint 1: Vector Nature of A ---\nCandidate D: Fails. The expression for A is proportional to v^2, a scalar, violating the vector nature of A.\nCandidates A, B, C: Pass. The expression for A is proportional to v_vec, a vector.\nRemaining candidates: ['A', 'B', 'C']\n\n--- Constraint 2: Dependence on Retarded Position ---\nCandidate B: Fails. The potential V depends on r (distance from origin) instead of d (distance from the charge's retarded position).\nCandidates A, C: Pass. The potentials correctly depend on d, the distance from the retarded position.\nRemaining candidates: ['A', 'C']\n\n--- Constraint 3: Physical Sign of the Doppler Factor ---\nCandidate A: Fails. The denominator (dc + d.v) would cause the potential to decrease for a charge moving towards the observer, which is physically incorrect.\nCandidate C: Pass. The denominator (dc - d.v) correctly causes the potential to increase for a charge moving towards the observer, which is consistent with the Doppler effect.\nRemaining candidates: ['C']\n\n\nErrors: \nChecker feedback:\noutput:"
