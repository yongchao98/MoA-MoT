    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem.

    ### Constraint Modeling

    1.  **Identify Product 1:**
        *   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).
        *   **Reagents:** KOH, 240°C. This suggests a base-induced reaction, possibly involving rearrangement due to the rigid adamantane cage and bridgehead positions of the bromines.
        *   **Product 1 Data:**
            *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This strongly indicates a saturated ketone (C=O), likely in a six-membered ring.
            *   ¹H NMR: 14 protons total, same as the starting material. This implies the reaction is C10H14Br2 -> C10H14O + 2 HBr (neutralized by KOH). The formula of Product 1 is C10H14O.
            *   The provided NMR data (4.79 ppm signal) is highly unusual for a simple ketone and inconsistent with plausible structures. It is likely erroneous or intended to be misleading. We will proceed by focusing on the reaction chemistry.

    2.  **Identify Product 2:**
        *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.
        *   **Analysis:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. Heating with a Lewis acid like Al(O-iPr)₃ can also catalyze the dehydration of the resulting alcohol to form an alkene.
        *   **Inference:** The reaction is a one-pot reduction-dehydration sequence. Product 2 must be an alkene.

    3.  **Identify Product 3:**
        *   **Reaction:** Product 2 (an alkene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).
        *   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (C=O).
        *   **Inference:** Product 3 is the result of cleaving the double bond in Product 2.

    ### Pruning the Search Space

    *   The adamantane skeleton itself poses a problem for the reaction sequence. A ketone on the adamantane framework (e.g., adamantan-2-one) would be reduced to an alcohol (adamantan-2-ol). However, this alcohol cannot be dehydrated to an alkene because it would require forming a double bond at a bridgehead position, which is forbidden by Bredt's rule.
    *   **Conclusion:** The adamantane skeleton must have rearranged in the first step to a different C10 isomer that allows for the subsequent dehydration step. The most common rearrangement product of adamantane is protoadamantane.
    *   Let's hypothesize the reaction path based on a protoadamantane intermediate:
        *   **Product 1:** Must be a protoadamantanone. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a ketone in a six-membered ring. This points to **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³⁸]decan-4-one). A ketone in a five-membered ring (like protoadamantan-2-one) would absorb at a higher frequency (~1745 cm⁻¹).
        *   **Product 2:** MPV reduction of protoadamantan-4-one gives protoadamantan-4-ol. This secondary alcohol can be dehydrated by eliminating a proton from the adjacent C5 position (which is not a bridgehead). This forms **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³⁸]dec-4-ene).
        *   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of the C4=C5 double bond in protoadamant-4-ene cleaves the bond, opening one of the rings. The resulting structure is a dialdehyde based on a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.

    ### Final Analysis: NMR of Product 3

    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ). The two aldehyde groups are equivalent.
    *   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in this molecule are the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm.
    *   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern for one of the equivalent aldehyde protons (e.g., the one at C3).
        1.  **3-Bond Coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton can couple to the proton on the carbon it is attached to (H3). This would typically result in a doublet. However, in sterically crowded or conformationally constrained systems like this, this coupling constant can be close to zero if the dihedral angle is near 90°. Given the options, we must consider this possibility.
        2.  **4-Bond Coupling (⁴J):** Long-range coupling over 4 bonds is common in rigid cyclic systems, especially through "W-shaped" pathways. The aldehyde proton at C3 can couple to the protons on C2 and C4.
    *   **Putting it together:** The pattern "triplet of triplets" (Option A) arises if the aldehyde proton couples to two distinct pairs of equivalent protons. This can be explained as follows:
        *   The 3-bond coupling to H3 is negligible (J ≈ 0).
        *   The aldehyde proton exhibits 4-bond coupling to the two axial protons on C2 and C4. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two axial protons are accidentally magnetically equivalent, leading to a **triplet**.
        *   The aldehyde proton also exhibits 4-bond coupling to the two equatorial protons on C2 and C4. This pair of protons is also accidentally equivalent, leading to another **triplet**.
        *   The combination of these two couplings results in a **triplet of triplets**.
