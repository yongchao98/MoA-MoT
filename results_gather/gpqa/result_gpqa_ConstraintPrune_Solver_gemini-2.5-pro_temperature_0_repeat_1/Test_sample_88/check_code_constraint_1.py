    # IR data (1720 cm-1) implies a ketone.
    # Step 2 (MPV reduction) confirms Product 1 is a ketone.
    # Step 3 (Ozonolysis) implies Product 1 must also have a C=C bond.
    # Conclusion: Product 1 is an unsaturated ketone, likely from a ring-opening rearrangement.
    # A plausible structure fitting the data is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one.

    # The ketone is selectively reduced to an alcohol.
