    Checks the correctness of the answer to the cell biology riddle.

    The riddle describes the co-translational transport pathway for secreted proteins.
    1.  Meeting Place: A "ribonucleoprotein particle" (Signal Recognition Particle, SRP) meets a "nascent chain" (new protein). This happens on a free ribosome in the cytosol.
    2.  Destination: The clues "you really need some sugar" (glycosylation in the ER), "It seems somewhat rough" (Rough ER), and "I need to be on my way" (secretory pathway) point to a protein being secreted from the cell. The final destination is the extracellular space.
