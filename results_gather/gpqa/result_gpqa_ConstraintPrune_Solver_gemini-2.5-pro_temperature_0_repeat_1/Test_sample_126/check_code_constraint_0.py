    # --- Constraint 2: Reaction Mechanism (Cope Rearrangement) ---
    # The reaction is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (Cope rearrangement) because a 1,5-diene is heated.
    # We derive the expected product based on the mechanism's rules.
    
    # Analysis of the rearrangement:
    # 1. Reactant: 5-butylnona-2,6-diene
    #    Structure: CH3-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH2(4)-CH(5)(Butyl)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH2(8)-CH3(9)
    # 2. The 1,5-diene system for the rearrangement involves atoms C2 through C7.
    # 3. Bond broken: The sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the system, which is the C4-C5 bond.
    # 4. Bond formed: A new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6 of the system, which is the C2-C7 bond.
    # 5. Pi bonds shift: The double bond at C2=C3 moves to C3=C4, and the one at C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.
    # 6. Resulting structure:
    #    The original C1 (methyl) is on C2. The original C8-C9 (ethyl) is on C7. The original butyl is on C5.
    #    The new structure can be traced as: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-(CH2CH2CH2CH3)
    # 7. IUPAC Naming of the product:
    #    - The longest carbon chain containing both double bonds has 10 carbons (deca).
    #    - Numbering from the left gives the lowest locants for the double bonds: deca-1,5-diene.
    #    - Substituents are a methyl group at C3 and an ethyl group at C4.
    #    - Assembling the name alphabetically gives: 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.
