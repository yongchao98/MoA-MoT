    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n### Constraint Analysis & Pruning\n\n1.  **Constraint 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.**\n    *   The regeneration of solid A (C → A) suggests that A is a relatively inert element (like a noble metal or non-metal) and C is a compound of A in a positive oxidation state that disproportionates or is reduced by water.\n    *   The formation of two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G), is a powerful clue. This implies C contains at least two different non-metallic elements that form acids upon hydrolysis.\n    *   A very plausible pair of acids is HCl (strong) and HIO₃ (iodic acid, weak). This implies C contains Chlorine and Iodine.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis: A = I₂ (Iodine, a solid). C would be an iodine chloride. The most common is iodine trichloride (ICl₃), which exists as a dimer, I₂Cl₆.\n    *   The hydrolysis of ICl₃ is: `5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → 15 HCl + 3 HIO₃ + I₂(s)`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates the starting solid A (I₂), and produces a strong acid F (HCl) and a weak acid G (HIO₃). This is an excellent fit for Constraint 3.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n    *   Based on the above, A = I₂ and C = I₂Cl₆. The reaction is `I₂(s) + 3 Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)`.\n    *   This identifies gas B as Chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   *Pruning/Conflict:* This model conflicts with two details in the constraint: the stoichiometry is 1:3, not 1:8, and the product I₂Cl₆ is bright yellow, not bright red. For the purpose of solving this riddle-like problem, we will assume these are inaccuracies in the problem statement, as the hydrolysis reaction is a much stronger chemical fingerprint.\n\n3.  **Constraint 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.**\n    *   We identified B = Cl₂. The constraint becomes: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(l)`.\n    *   A well-known reaction that fits this perfectly is the formation of sulfuryl chloride: `SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   This identifies gas D as Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂) and the liquid solvent H as Sulfuryl Chloride (SO₂Cl₂).\n\n4.  **Constraint 2: When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.**\n    *   We have identified C = I₂Cl₆ and D = SO₂. The reaction is: `I₂Cl₆(s) + 2 SO₂(g) → E`.\n    *   I₂Cl₆ is an oxidizing agent, and SO₂ is a reducing agent. A plausible reaction is the reduction of iodine and the oxidation of sulfur, while chlorine is transferred.\n    *   `I₂Cl₆(s) + 2 SO₂(g) → I₂(s) + 2 SO₂Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   *Pruning/Conflict:* This reaction produces two products (I₂ and SO₂Cl₂), not a single product E. However, SO₂Cl₂ (sulfuryl chloride) is itself an extremely hazardous substance (toxic, corrosive, reacts violently with water). It is plausible that E is intended to be SO₂Cl₂.\n\n### Identifying E and its Symmetry\n\nBased on the most consistent chemical system derived, we identify E as sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂). Now, we determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n*   **Molecule:** SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl Chloride)\n*   **Structure:** It has a tetrahedral geometry around the central sulfur atom, with two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms attached.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   There is one C₂ rotation axis that bisects the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles.\n    *   There are two mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane contains the Cl-S-Cl atoms and bisects the O-S-O angle. The other plane contains the O-S-O atoms and bisects the Cl-S-Cl angle.\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes defines the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Chemical Identities based on deduction\nA = \"Iodine (I₂)\"\nB = \"Chlorine (Cl₂)\"\nC = \"Iodine trichloride dimer (I₂Cl₆)\"\nD = \"Sulfur dioxide (SO₂)\"\nE = \"Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂)\"\nF = \"Hydrochloric acid (HCl)\"\nG = \"Iodic acid (HIO₃)\"\nH = \"Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂)\"\n\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": \"C2v\",\n    \"B\": \"C2\",\n    \"C\": \"D4h\",\n    \"D\": \"D∞h\"\n}\n\n# The identified molecule E is SO₂Cl₂, which has C2v symmetry.\nidentified_symmetry = \"C2v\"\nfinal_candidate = \"A\"\n\nprint(f\"Candidate molecule for E: {E}\")\nprint(f\"Symmetry of {E}: {identified_symmetry}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_candidate} ({candidates[final_candidate]}).\\n\")\n\n# Final check of constraints with the derived chemical system\nprint(\"--- Constraint Pass/Fail Analysis ---\")\n\n# Constraint 1: A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(red)\n# Reaction: I₂(s) + 3Cl₂(g) -> I₂Cl₆(s)\nprint(\"Constraint 1 (A + 8B -> C): FAIL (Stoichiometry is 1:3 not 1:8; Color is yellow not red)\")\n\n# Constraint 2: C + 2D -> E\n# Reaction: I₂Cl₆(s) + 2SO₂(g) -> I₂(s) + 2SO₂Cl₂(l)\nprint(\"Constraint 2 (C + 2D -> E): FAIL (Reaction produces two products, not a single product E)\")\n\n# Constraint 3: C + H₂O -> A + F + G\n# Reaction: 5I₂Cl₆ + 18H₂O -> 2I₂ + 30HCl + 6HIO₃\nprint(\"Constraint 3 (C -> A + F + G): PASS (Qualitatively fits: regenerates A, produces strong acid F and weak acid G)\")\n\n# Constraint 4: D + B -> H\n# Reaction: SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\nprint(\"Constraint 4 (D + B -> H): PASS (Perfect fit for a 1:1 gas reaction forming a liquid solvent)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nNote: Despite inconsistencies (likely from the puzzle's formulation), the derived system is the most chemically plausible, leading to E = SO₂Cl₂ with C2v symmetry.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
