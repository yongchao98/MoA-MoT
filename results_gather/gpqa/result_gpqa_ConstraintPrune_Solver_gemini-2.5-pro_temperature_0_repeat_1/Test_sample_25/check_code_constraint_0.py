    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the chemistry question.

    1. The identity of reactant A.
    2. The reactivity order of the dienes (B).
    """

    # --- Constraint 1: Determine the structure of reactant A ---
    # The reaction is: Cyclohexene + A ---> 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one
    # The product name `bicyclo[4.2.0]octan` indicates a fused ring system of a 6-membered ring and a 4-membered ring.
    # This is the characteristic product of a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction.
    # Cyclohexene (6 carbons) reacts with A to form an 8-carbon product.
    # Therefore, reactant A must contribute 2 carbons.
    # The product has a ketone group (`-one`) and two iodine atoms (`diiodo`) on carbon 8, which comes from reactant A.
    # A 2-carbon molecule with a C=C double bond (for the cycloaddition), a ketone, and two iodines must be a ketene.
    # The structure is Iâ‚‚C=C=O, which is named 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.
    correct_reactant_A = "2,2-diiodoethen-1-one"

    # --- Constraint 2: Determine the reactivity order of the dienes (B) ---
    # The reactivity of dienes in cycloaddition reactions (like Diels-Alder) depends on:
    # a) The ability to adopt the planar s-cis conformation.
    # b) Electronic effects (electron-donating groups increase reactivity).
    #
    # Analysis of the dienes:
    # 3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene: The ring structure locks it in the required s-cis conformation, making it extremely reactive. (Most reactive)
    # 1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene: The two electron-donating methyl groups on the central carbons increase reactivity and favor the s-cis conformation. (Very reactive)
    # 2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene: This open-chain diene can rotate into the s-cis conformation, but the s-trans is generally more stable. It is less reactive than dienes 1 and 3.
    # 4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene: In the required s-cis conformation, the terminal methyl groups would clash severely, causing high steric hindrance. This makes it virtually unreactive. (Least reactive)
    #
    # The correct order from most reactive to least reactive is: 3 > 1 > 2 > 4.
