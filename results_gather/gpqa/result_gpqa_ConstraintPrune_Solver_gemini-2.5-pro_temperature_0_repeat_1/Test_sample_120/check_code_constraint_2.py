    # Therefore, C6 is less hindered.

    # --- Step 3: Determine Product Structure and IUPAC Nomenclature ---
    # The reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol.
    # - The -OH group is on the original C1.
    # - A new methyl group is on the original C6.
    # - Original methyl groups are on C1, C3, and C4.
    # For IUPAC naming:
    # - The carbon with the -OH group (original C1) becomes the new C1.
    # - The ring is numbered towards the new methyl group (original C6) to give lowest locants.
    # This results in the following mapping from original carbons to new IUPAC numbers:
    # New C1 <- Original C1
    # New C2 <- Original C6
    # New C3 <- Original C5
    # New C4 <- Original C4
    # New C5 <- Original C3
    # New C6 <- Original C2
    
    # The four methyl groups are located at:
    # - Original C1 -> New C1
    # - Original C3 -> New C5
    # - Original C4 -> New C4
    # - The new methyl group at Original C6 -> New C2
