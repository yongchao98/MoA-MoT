    "The user wants to find the momentum of a photon absorbed by a diatomic molecule, causing it to transition from its ground state to the next lowest possible energy state.\n\n### Step 1: Model the System and Constraints\n\n1.  **System:** A diatomic molecule (X, Y) in its fundamental (ground) state.\n2.  **Model:** The quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a state `(v, J)` is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)`\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number, `J` is the rotational quantum number, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant `B = ħ² / (2I)`. `I` is the moment of inertia, `I = μR²`, and `μ` is the reduced mass.\n3.  **Initial State:** The fundamental state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: `v=0` and `J=0`.\n4.  **Transition:** The molecule absorbs a photon. The selection rules for a rovibrational transition are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n5.  **Final State:** Starting from `J=0`, only `ΔJ = +1` is possible. Therefore, the transition must be from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=1, J=1)`. This is the lowest energy *rovibrational* transition. A pure rotational transition (`v=0, J=0` -> `v=0, J=1`) would have much lower energy, but the magnitude of the provided answers suggests we are looking for a transition involving a change in the vibrational state.\n6.  **Energy of Transition (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    `ΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)`\n    `ΔE = [ (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) ] - [ (0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1) ]`\n    `ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]`\n    `ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n7.  **Photon Momentum (p):** The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by `p = ΔE / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Iterative Calculation and Pruning\n\nWe will now calculate the required values step-by-step. The code will first perform an order-of-magnitude check to prune the search space before calculating the final precise value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Setup: Define constants and candidates ---\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_m = 2.0 * 10**(-10)  # Bond length in meters\nw_rad_s = 4.0 * 10**14   # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Physical constants\namu_to_kg = 1.66054 * 10**(-27)\nh_bar_Js = 1.05457 * 10**(-34)\nc_m_s = 2.99792 * 10**8\n\n# Candidate answers for photon momentum (p) in N*s\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": 1.9 * 10**(-28),\n    \"B\": 1.4 * 10**(-28),\n    \"C\": 1.1 * 10**(-27),\n    \"D\": 2.3 * 10**(-27),\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Modeling the problem ---\")\nprint(\"Model: Quantum rotation-vibration.\")\nprint(\"Initial state (fundamental): v=0, J=0.\")\nprint(\"Final state (lowest energy rovibrational transition): v=1, J=1.\")\nprint(\"Transition Energy: delta_E = h_bar*w + 2B\")\nprint(\"Photon Momentum: p = delta_E / c\\n\")\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Calculate Reduced Mass (mu) ---\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nmu_kg = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\nprint(f\"Constraint 1: Reduced Mass (mu) = {mu_kg:.4e} kg.
