    "The user wants to identify the correct decay path and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Initial State**: $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$\n2.  **Final State**: $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$\n3.  **Process**: A two-step cascade decay $|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle$, where $|k\\rangle$ is an intermediate state. Both steps must be electric dipole transitions.\n4.  **Constraint 1: Selection Rules for the first transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The electric dipole selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For spontaneous emission, energy must decrease, so $n' < n=3$. All options propose an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is valid.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Constraint 2: Selection Rules for the second transition $|k\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   We check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   For $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l'=1$. The final state has $l_{final}=0$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$. Since $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, this condition is met for all possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Conclusion from selection rules**: All paths proposed in the options (A, B, C, D) are physically allowed. We must use probabilities to distinguish them.\n\n6.  **Constraint 3: Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n    *   The total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Step 1**: The atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state can decay to any of the three states in the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ manifold. We need to find the branching ratio for each path.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{r}|nlm\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This implies that the transition rates to each of the possible final $m'$ states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be equal.\n    *   Let the rate for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ be $W_{m'}$. Then $W_{-1} = W_0 = W_1$.\n    *   The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is $W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_0 + W_1 = 3W_0$.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) of decaying into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $P(m') = \\frac{W_{m'}}{W_{total}}$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability for each of the three paths is the same: $P(-1) = P(0) = P(1) = \\frac{W_0}{3W_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Step 2**: Once the atom is in an intermediate state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only allowed electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. (Decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden since $\\Delta l= -1 \\neq \\pm 1$). Thus, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   The total probability of a given cascade is therefore equal to the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### Code Verification and Final Check\n\nThe following Python code verifies the constraints and calculates the branching ratios.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the H-atom decay problem by applying constraints for selection\n    rules and calculating branching ratios to find the correct decay path.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define states and options from the problem\n    initial_state = {'n': 3, 'l': 0, 'm': 0}\n    final_state = {'n': 1, 'l': 0, 'm': 0}\n    options = {\n        'A': {'path': '|3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0>', 'intermediate_m': 1, 'prob': S('1/4')},\n        'B': {'path': '|3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0>', 'intermediate_m': -1, 'prob': S('1/4')},\n        'C': {'path': '|3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>', 'intermediate_m': 0, 'prob': S('2/3')},\n        'D': {'path': '|3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>', 'intermediate_m': 0, 'prob': S('1/3')}\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Constraint 1 & 2: Dipole Selection Rules ---\")\n    # All options involve |n,l,m> changes that satisfy delta_l = +/-1 and delta_m = 0, +/-1\n    # for both steps of the decay.\n    for name, opt in options.items():\n        print(f\"Option {name}: Path {opt['path']}.

The subsequent decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is guaranteed. Therefore, the overall probability of the cascade is determined by the first step.\n\n*   Path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$. Option A is incorrect ($1/4$).\n*   Path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$. Option B is incorrect ($1/4$).\n*   Path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$. Option C is incorrect ($2/3$), while Option D is correct ($1/3$).\n\nThe correct transition route and probability is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $1/3$.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has confirmed the output is correct. The code successfully applied the constraints and identified the correct option.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: All proposed paths are valid according to the electric dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n2.  **Branching Ratios**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the transition rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final $l'=1$ state are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m'\\rangle^2$. For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, these coefficients are equal for all possible final $m'$ states. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$ states.\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: Since there are three equally likely decay channels from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ manifold, the probability for each is $1/3$. The subsequent decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, so its probability is 1. The total probability of the cascade is therefore the probability of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
