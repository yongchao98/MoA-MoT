    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a multi-step organic synthesis reaction, followed by a structural analysis of the final product to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The core of the problem is to correctly identify the product of each reaction, which involves recognizing standard organic reactions and pruning less likely pathways.\n\n### Constraint Modeling and Search Space Pruning\n\n**Constraint 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Analysis:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Bromine will substitute a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Pruning:** The two alpha-positions on cyclohexanone are chemically equivalent. Therefore, only one product is formed.\n*   **Result:** Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Status:** PASS. This is a standard, unambiguous reaction.\n\n**Constraint 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) + heat.\n*   **Analysis:** An alpha-halo ketone treated with a strong base can undergo two primary reactions: elimination or rearrangement.\n    *   *Pathway A (Elimination):* The base removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), leading to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n    *   *Pathway B (Rearrangement):* The conditions are ideal for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The base deprotonates the alpha-carbon (C6), which then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. Subsequent nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and ring-opening leads to a ring contraction.\n*   **Pruning:** We must decide which pathway is more likely. Let's look ahead to Step 3, which uses thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). SOCl₂ is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides. It does not have a common, productive reaction with α,β-unsaturated ketones. The Favorskii rearrangement (Pathway B) produces a carboxylic acid (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid), which fits perfectly with the next step. Therefore, we prune Pathway A.\n*   **Result:** Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Status:** PASS. The Favorskii rearrangement is the most chemically consistent pathway.\n\n**Constraint 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) + Pyridine.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is a non-nucleophilic base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Result:** Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Status:** PASS. This is a standard textbook reaction.\n\n**Constraint 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Analysis:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered, mild reducing agent. It is known to reduce reactive carbonyl compounds like acyl chlorides to aldehydes and stop at that stage, preventing over-reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Result:** Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Status:** PASS. This is a standard selective reduction.\n\n**Constraint 5: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n*   **Task:** Determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Analysis:** We must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct H)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The single proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 distinct H)\n    3.  **C2/C5-H's:** The two carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by rotation or symmetry). The same is true for C5. The \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. This results in **two** distinct sets of hydrogens for these four protons. (2 distinct H types)\n    4.  **C3/C4-H's:** Similarly, the next two carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic, giving rise to another **two** distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 distinct H types)\n*   **Tally:** 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6.\n*   **Result:** There are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Status:** PASS. The symmetry analysis is complete.\n\n```python\n# This script models the logical deduction of the chemical synthesis and product analysis.\n\ndef solve_organic_synthesis_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the constraints of the multi-step synthesis and analyzes the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Constraint 1: Bromination ---\n    reactant_0 = \"cyclohexanone\"\n    product_1 = \"2-bromocyclohexanone\"\n    print(f\"Constraint 1: {reactant_0} + Br2 -> {product_1}\")\n    print(\"Pass/Fail: PASS.
