    "Here is the thinking process to solve the problem, modeled as a set of constraints.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Primary Goal:** Determine the ratio of transit probabilities, `P_1 / P_2`, to decide which planet is the preferred observation target.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: Transit Probability Formula.** For a planet on a circular orbit with a random inclination, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_star`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `P_transit = R_star / a`\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Kepler's Third Law.** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly provided. However, it is related to the orbital period (`T`) and the host star's mass (`M_star`) by Kepler's Third Law: `T^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star`. We can rearrange this to solve for `a`.\n    *   `a^3 ∝ M_star * T^2`\n    *   `a ∝ (M_star * T^2)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Constraint 3: Combined Probability Expression.** By substituting the expression for `a` from Constraint 2 into the formula from Constraint 1, we can express the transit probability in terms of the known parameters.\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * T^2)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Constraint 4: Given Ratios.** The problem provides the relationships between the parameters for the two systems.\n    *   Orbital Period: `T_2 = 3 * T_1`\n    *   Stellar Mass: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n    *   Stellar Radius: `R_s1 = R_s2`\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\nBy using the combined probability expression from Constraint 3, we can form a ratio of the probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2. This approach prunes the search space significantly because all unknown constants of proportionality (like the gravitational constant `G` or factors of `4π^2`) and the absolute base values (`M_s2`, `R_s2`, `T_2`) will cancel out, leaving only the given ratios.\n\nThe ratio is:\n`P_1 / P_2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * T_1^2)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * T_2^2)^(1/3)]`\n`P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * T_2^2) / (M_s1 * T_1^2)]^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios from Constraint 4 to find the numerical answer without needing to brute-force any unknown values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constraint Modeling & Setup ---\n\n# Let's define the properties of System 2 as our baseline (with arbitrary units).\n# The absolute values don't matter, only the ratios.\nM_s2 = 1.0  # Mass of Star 2\nR_s2 = 1.0  # Radius of Star 2\nT_2 = 3.0   # Orbital period of Planet 2\n\n# Constraint 4: Define the properties of System 1 based on the given ratios.\n# The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2.\nT_1 = T_2 / 3.0\n# The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.\nM_s1 = 2.0 * M_s2\n# Both host stars have the same radii.\nR_s1 = R_s2\n\nprint(\"--- Input Parameters based on Constraints ---\")\nprint(f\"System 1: M_s1={M_s1}, R_s1={R_s1}, T_1={T_1}\")\nprint(f\"System 2: M_s2={M_s2}, R_s2={R_s2}, T_2={T_2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# --- Pruning & Calculation ---\n\n# Constraint 3: The transit probability is proportional to R_star / (M_star * T^2)^(1/3).\n# We calculate the proportional probability for each planet.\n# The constant of proportionality is the same for both and will cancel in the ratio.\n\n# Proportional probability for Planet 1\nprob_1_proportional = R_s1 / (M_s1 * T_1**2)**(1/3)\n\n# Proportional probability for Planet 2\nprob_2_proportional = R_s2 / (M_s2 * T_2**2)**(1/3)\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nprobability_ratio = prob_1_proportional / prob_2_proportional\n\nprint(f\"Calculated Ratio P1/P2: {probability_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# --- Final Check against Options ---\n\n# Candidate A: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.\n# This means the ratio P1/P2 should be ~1.65.\ncandidate_A_ratio = 1.65\ncheck_A = math.isclose(probability_ratio, candidate_A_ratio, rel_tol=1e-2)\nprint(f\"Constraint Check A (Ratio ≈ {candidate_A_ratio}): {'Pass' if check_A else 'Fail'}\")\n\n# Candidate B: Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.\n# This means the ratio P2/P1 should be ~2.25, or P1/P2 ~ 1/2.25.\ncandidate_B_ratio = 1 / 2.25\ncheck_B = math.isclose(probability_ratio, candidate_B_ratio, rel_tol=1e-2)\nprint(f\"Constraint Check B (Ratio ≈ {candidate_B_ratio:.2f}): {'Pass' if check_B else 'Fail'}\")\n\n# Candidate C: Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.\n# This means the ratio P2/P1 should be ~1.5, or P1/P2 ~ 1/1.5.\ncandidate_C_ratio = 1 / 1.5\ncheck_C = math.isclose(probability_ratio, candidate_C_ratio, rel_tol=1e-2)\nprint(f\"Constraint Check C (Ratio ≈ {candidate_C_ratio:.2f}): {'Pass' if check_C else 'Fail'}\")\n\n# Candidate D: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.\n# This means the ratio P1/P2 should be ~2.7.\ncandidate_D_ratio = 2.7\ncheck_D = math.isclose(probability_ratio, candidate_D_ratio, rel_tol=1e-2)\nprint(f\"Constraint Check D (Ratio ≈ {candidate_D_ratio}): {'Pass' if check_D else 'Fail'}\")\n\n# Final conclusion based on the passing check\nif check_A:\n    final_answer = \"A\"\nelif check_B:\n    final_answer = \"B\"\nelif check_C:\n    final_answer = \"C\"\nelif check_D:\n    final_answer = \"D\"\nelse:\n    final_answer = \"None\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nConclusion: The calculated ratio matches option {final_answer}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
