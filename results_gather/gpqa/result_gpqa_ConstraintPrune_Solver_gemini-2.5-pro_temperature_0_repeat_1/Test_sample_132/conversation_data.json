    "Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the problem using a constraint-based approach.\n\nThe goal is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO₄³⁻].\n\n**Constraint 1: Initial Molar Concentrations**\nThe first constraint is to determine the initial molar concentrations of the primary buffer components, dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) from KH₂PO₄ and hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, in the solution.\n\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass of KH₂PO₄ / Molar Mass of KH₂PO₄\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Molar Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O\n*   Concentration = Moles / Volume\n\n**Constraint 2: Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe solution is a buffer system governed by the equilibrium between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], can be determined using the equilibrium constant Ka₂. We can assume the initial concentrations are a very good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations because the Ka is small.\n\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Therefore, [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n**Constraint 3: Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nThe final constraint is to calculate the concentration of the target ion, PO₄³⁻. This ion is produced from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, an equilibrium governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Therefore, [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nBy satisfying these constraints in order, we can prune the search space from all possible concentrations down to a single calculated value, which can then be checked against the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Problem Definition ---\n# Given values\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # Convert cm3 to L\nmass_kh2po4_g = 1.00\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o_g = 1.00\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Candidate answers\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": 6.24e-7,\n    \"B\": 2.81e-7,\n    \"C\": 3.97e-7,\n    \"D\": 5.48e-7,\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Solving with Constraints ---\")\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Initial Molar Concentrations ---\nprint(\"\\nConstraint 1: Calculate initial concentrations of buffer components.\")\nmoles_kh2po4 = mass_kh2po4_g / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_kh2po4 / volume_L\nprint(f\"Initial [H2PO4-] = {conc_h2po4_minus:.6f} M\")\n\nmoles_na2hpo4_2h2o = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o_g / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_na2hpo4_2h2o / volume_L\nprint(f\"Initial [HPO4(2-)] = {conc_hpo4_2minus:.6f} M\")\n# This constraint is satisfied by calculation.\n\n# --- Constraint 2: Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+] ---\nprint(\"\\nConstraint 2: Calculate [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium.\")\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4(2-)]\n# We assume initial concentrations are approximately equal to equilibrium concentrations.\nconc_h_plus = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\nprint(f\"Calculated [H+] = {conc_h_plus:.4e} M\")\n# This constraint is satisfied by calculation.\n\n# --- Constraint 3: Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4(3-)] ---\nprint(\"\\nConstraint 3: Calculate [PO4(3-)] using the Ka3 equilibrium.\")\n# [PO4(3-)] = Ka3 * [HPO4(2-)] / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_h_plus)\nprint(f\"Calculated [PO4(3-)] = {conc_po4_3minus:.4e} M\")\n# This is our final calculated value.\n\n# --- Final Check: Compare with Candidates ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Check ---\")\nfor label, value in candidates.items():\n    # Check if the calculated value is very close to the candidate value\n    is_match = math.isclose(conc_po4_3minus, value, rel_tol=1e-3)\n    status = \"Pass\" if is_match else \"Fail\"\n    print(f\"Candidate {label} ({value:.2e}): {status}\")\n\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
