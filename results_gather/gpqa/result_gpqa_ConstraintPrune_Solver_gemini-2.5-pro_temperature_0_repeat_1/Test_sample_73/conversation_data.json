    "The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which is governed by the exponential distribution.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability `P_survive(t)` that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` is given by `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n2.  **Decay Probability:** The probability `P_decay(t)` that an atom *has* decayed by time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n3.  **Memoryless Property:** A key feature of exponential decay is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Mathematically, `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`. This is the most critical constraint for pruning the problem. It implies that the 50 minutes that have already passed do not affect the future decay probability. The problem simplifies to finding the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Pruning the Search Space:**\n\n*   The initial information is: `P_decay(100 minutes) = 0.32`. We can use this to find the fundamental decay constant `λ`.\n*   The condition \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" can be ignored for calculating the future probability due to the memoryless property. We only need to calculate the probability of decay over the *next* 150 minutes.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1.  Use the given data to find `λ`.\n2.  Use `λ` and the memoryless property to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Initial Data ---\np_decay_100 = 0.32\nt_initial = 100  # minutes\nt_survived = 50  # minutes (this information is irrelevant due to memoryless property)\nt_future = 150   # minutes\n\nprint(f\"--- Modeling the Task as Constraints ---\")\n\n# --- Constraint 1: The decay process must follow the exponential decay law. ---\n# We use this to find the decay constant lambda (λ).\n# P_decay(t) = 1 - exp(-λ*t)\n# 0.32 = 1 - exp(-λ * 100)\n# exp(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# -λ * 100 = ln(0.68)\n# λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\np_survive_100 = 1 - p_decay_100\nlambda_val = -math.log(p_survive_100) / t_initial\nconstraint_1_pass = lambda_val > 0\nprint(f\"Constraint 1: Calculate decay constant λ from P_decay(100) = 0.32.\")\nprint(f\"  - Calculated λ = {lambda_val:.6f} min^-1\")\nprint(f\"  - Constraint Pass/Fail (λ > 0): {'Pass' if constraint_1_pass else 'Fail'}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Constraint 2: The process must be memoryless. ---\n# This is the key pruning step.
