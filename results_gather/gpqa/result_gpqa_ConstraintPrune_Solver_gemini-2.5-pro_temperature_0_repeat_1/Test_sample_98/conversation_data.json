    "The user wants me to identify a compound from four options using FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **FTIR Constraint:** The spectrum shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid). This indicates the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n2.  **NMR Vinyl Constraint:** The spectrum shows no signals for vinyl hydrogens. This means the compound has no C=C double bonds.\n3.  **NMR Splitting Constraint:** The spectrum contains two specific complex signals:\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This signal arises from a proton (let's call it H_A) that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (gives the doublet, n=1).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (gives the triplet, n=2).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (gives the quartet, n=3).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH group adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This signal arises from a proton (H_B) coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n        *   One neighboring proton (gives the doublet, n=1).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (gives the first triplet, n=2).\n        *   Another two neighboring protons (gives the second triplet, n=2).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH group adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\nI will now analyze each candidate against these constraints, prioritizing the most selective ones (the NMR splitting patterns).\n\n*   **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   Proton on C3: Coupled to H on C2 (2H), H on C4 (1H), and H on the C3-methyl (3H). Neighbor counts: {1, 2, 3}. This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n    *   Proton on C4: Coupled to H on C3 (1H), H on C5 (3H), and H on the C4-methyl (3H). Neighbor counts: {1, 3, 3}. This would be a dqq.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one CH and two CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a **dtt**.\n    *   **Result: Eliminated.**\n\n*   **Candidate B: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n    *   Proton on C3: Coupled to H on C2 (1H), H on C4 (2H), and H on the C3-methyl (3H). Neighbor counts: {1, 2, 3}. This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one CH and two CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a **dtt**.\n    *   **Result: Eliminated.**\n\n*   **Candidate D: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(2)(C₂H₅)-COOH(1)`\n    *   Proton on C3: Coupled to H on C2 (1H), H on C4 (2H), and H on the C3-ethyl's CH₂ (2H). Neighbor counts: {1, 2, 2}. This matches the requirement for a **dtt**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. It cannot produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **Result: Eliminated.**\n\n*   **Candidate C: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   Proton on C4: Coupled to H on C3 (1H), H on C5 (3H), and H on the C4-ethyl's CH₂ (2H). Neighbor counts: {1, 2, 3}. This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n    *   Proton on C3: Coupled to H on C2 (2H), H on C4 (1H), and H on the C3-ethyl's CH₂ (2H). Neighbor counts: {1, 2, 2}.
