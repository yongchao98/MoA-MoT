def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for the RCM synthesis question.

    The question asks for the starting material to synthesize 
    5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM).

    The provided answer is A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

    The logic for verification is as follows:
    1.  **Ring Size**: To form a 6-membered ring (cyclohexene) via RCM of a terminal
        diene, the starting material must be an octa-1,7-diene. This check
        eliminates options that would form different-sized rings.
    2.  **Substituent Placement**: The substituents on the starting diene chain
        determine the substituents on the final product ring. For an octa-1,7-diene,
        a substituent at position 'k' on the starting chain corresponds to a
        substituent at position 'k' on the product ring (given the correct IUPAC
        numbering of the product). This allows for a direct comparison of substituent
        positions between the proposed starting material and the target product.
