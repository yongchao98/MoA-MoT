    # Step 1: Verify the structure of the final product, 4.
    # The reaction sequence described (Diels-Alder, deprotection, oxidation, retro-Diels-Alder, trapping Diels-Alder)
    # correctly leads to Product 4 being the Diels-Alder adduct of 7-norbornadienone and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.
    # This part of the LLM's reasoning is sound.

    # Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of Product 4.
    # The molecule has a single plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry) that contains the C=O group and bisects the rest of the molecule.
    # The LLM's reasoning also correctly identifies a mirror plane.

    # Step 3: Count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments based on this symmetry.
    # Protons that are reflected into each other by the mirror plane are chemically equivalent and count as one type.
    
    # Count for the norbornenone-derived part of the molecule:
    # - H1/H4 (bridgehead protons): They are a reflected pair. Count = 1 type.
    # - H5/H6 (alkene protons): They are a reflected pair. Count = 1 type.
    # - H2/H3 (new ring junction protons): They are a reflected pair. Count = 1 type.
    norbornenone_part_types = 1 + 1 + 1  # Total = 3

    # Count for the diene-derived part of the molecule:
    # - Protons from the two exocyclic methylidene groups: These form two new CH2 groups. The groups are equivalent by reflection,
    #   but the two protons within each group are diastereotopic. This gives two pairs of equivalent protons. Count = 2 types.
    # - Protons on the cyclohexadiene ring: There are 4 vinylic protons. They form two pairs due to the mirror plane. Count = 2 types.
    diene_part_types = 2 + 2  # Total = 4

    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of distinct hydrogens.
