    "The problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which sets a fundamental limit on the precision of a quantum state's energy based on its lifetime.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **Energy Broadening:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) does not have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"broadened\" or uncertain by an amount ΔE. The relationship is given by the uncertainty principle: ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation, we approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n2.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (E2 - E1) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy broadening, so the state with the shorter lifetime will be the dominant factor.\n\n**Pruning the Search Space:**\n\nWe can calculate the minimum required energy separation before checking the options.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   Energy width of state 1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   Energy width of state 2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   Minimum required separation: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ + 0.66 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe required energy difference must be greater than ~7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.
