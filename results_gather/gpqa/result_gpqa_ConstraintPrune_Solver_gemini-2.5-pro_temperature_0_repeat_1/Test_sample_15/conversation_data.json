    "The task is to determine the number of optically active compounds from a given list. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The primary constraints for determining optical activity are:\n\n1.  **Presence of Chiral Centers:** A molecule with one or more stereocenters (chiral centers) is often chiral. A stereocenter is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Absence of Internal Symmetry:** A molecule with chiral centers can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Such compounds are called meso compounds and are optically inactive.\n3.  **Explicit Stereochemical Designation:** If a compound's name includes a stereochemical descriptor like (R), (S), or specifies a single stereoisomer of a complex molecule, it is considered a single enantiomer (or diastereomer) and is optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n\nWe will apply these constraints to each compound to prune the possibilities and identify the optically active ones.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds for optical activity based on their names.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"chiral_centers\": 0,\n            \"symmetry\": True, # Has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond)\n            \"meso\": False,\n            \"notes\": \"No chiral centers.

    "An optically active compound must be chiral and present as a single enantiomer (or an excess of one). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically requires the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This is an alkene. The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name explicitly defines a single stereoisomer with specific configurations (3aR, 7aS, E). This indicates that the molecule is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer (or diastereomer). Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that passes between C2 and C3. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form above. The (2R, 3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 (bearing the -OH group) is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation (from cis/trans nomenclature, similar to R/S but for relative stereochemistry) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all axial or all equatorial in a chair conformation). This molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry, making it highly symmetric and achiral. It is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is a ketone: (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon in the isobutyl group bonded to two methyl groups is not chiral, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring or the rest of the chain are chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Yes)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Yes)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
