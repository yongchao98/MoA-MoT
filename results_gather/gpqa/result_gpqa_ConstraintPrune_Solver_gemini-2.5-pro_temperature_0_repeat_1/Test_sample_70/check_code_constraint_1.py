    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.
    
    The problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).
    The given answer from the LLM is D, which corresponds to a value of ~0.83.
    This code will calculate the correct ratio based on physics principles and compare it to the given answer.

    # --- Define problem parameters ---
    # Orbital period ratios are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5
    # We need the ratio for Planet 4 and Planet 2.

    # The value corresponding to the given answer choice D.
    llm_answer_value = 0.83

    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # 1. Equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to r^(-1/2), where r is the orbital radius.
    #    This is because the energy absorbed by the planet scales as 1/r^2, and the energy radiated scales as T_eq^4.
    #    So, T_eq^4 ∝ 1/r^2 => T_eq ∝ 1/√r = r^(-1/2).
    #    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (r4 / r2)^(-1/2).
    
    # 2. Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) 
    #    is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (r for circular orbits).
    #    P² ∝ r³  =>  r ∝ P^(2/3).
    #    Therefore, the ratio of radii is: r4 / r2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).
    
    # 3. Combining these two principles:
    #    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P4 / P2)^(2/3) ]^(-1/2)
    #    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^((2/3) * (-1/2))
    #    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)

    # --- Calculation ---

        # Calculate the theoretically correct ratio.
        correct_ratio = period_ratio_p4_over_p2 ** (-1.0 / 3.0)
