    # --- Derivation of the formula ---
    # 1. Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star states P² ∝ r³, where P is the orbital period and r is the orbital radius.
    #    Therefore, (r_a / r_b) = (P_a / P_b)^(2/3).

    # 2. The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to 1/√r, assuming the same stellar luminosity and planetary albedo.
    #    Therefore, (T_a / T_b) = √(r_b / r_a) = (r_b / r_a)^(1/2).

    # 3. To find the temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T4/T2), we combine the laws:
    #    T4 / T2 = (r2 / r4)^(1/2)
    #    Substitute the radius ratio from Kepler's Law: r2 / r4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)
    #    T4 / T2 = ( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)
    #    T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))
    #    T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)
