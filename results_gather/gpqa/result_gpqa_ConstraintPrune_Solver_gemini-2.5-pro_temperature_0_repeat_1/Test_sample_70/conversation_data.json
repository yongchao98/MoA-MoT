    "The task is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, given their orbital period ratios. This can be modeled using two primary physical constraints: Kepler's Third Law and the formula for planetary equilibrium temperature.\n\n**Constraint Modeling & Pruning:**\n\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius (r).\n    *   Constraint: `(P_i / P_j)² = (r_i / r_j)³`\n    *   This allows us to relate the ratio of orbital radii to the ratio of orbital periods: `(r_i / r_j) = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3)`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula simplifies to show that T_eq is proportional to `1 / sqrt(r)`, assuming the star's luminosity and the planet's albedo are constant.\n    *   Constraint: `T_eq ∝ 1 / r^(1/2)`\n    *   The problem states the planets have the same albedo, and they orbit the same star, so this simplification is valid.\n    *   This allows us to relate the ratio of temperatures to the ratio of orbital radii: `(T_i / T_j) = (r_j / r_i)^(1/2)`.\n\n**Pruning (Combining Constraints):**\nWe can combine these two constraints to find a direct relationship between the temperature ratio and the period ratio, thus pruning the need to calculate the actual orbital radii.\n\n*   Substitute the radius ratio from Constraint 1 into the temperature ratio equation from Constraint 2:\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (r_2 / r_4)^(1/2)`\n    `T_4 / T_2 = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)`\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nThis final, pruned relationship shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods. We can now proceed with the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Problem Data ---\n# Orbital period ratios P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5\nperiod_ratios = {1: 1.0, 2: 2.0, 3: 2.5, 4: 3.5, 5: 5.0}\nplanet_i = 4\nplanet_j = 2\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Orbital Period Ratio ---\n# The ratio of periods is given by the problem statement.\nP_i = period_ratios[planet_i]\nP_j = period_ratios[planet_j]\nperiod_ratio_i_j = P_i / P_j\nprint(f\"Constraint 1: Period Ratio (P{planet_i}/P{planet_j})\")\nprint(f\"  - Value: {period_ratio_i_j:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  - Status: PASS (from problem data)\\n\")\n\n# --- Constraint 2: Radius Ratio (derived from Kepler's 3rd Law) ---\n# (r_i / r_j) = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3)\nradius_ratio_i_j = period_ratio_i_j**(2/3)\nprint(f\"Constraint 2: Radius Ratio (r{planet_i}/r{planet_j}) from Kepler's Law\")\nprint(f\"  - Value: {radius_ratio_i_j:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  - Status: PASS (derived from Constraint 1)\\n\")\n\n# --- Constraint 3: Temperature Ratio (derived from Equilibrium Temp formula) ---\n# (T_i / T_j) = (r_j / r_i)^(1/2)\n# This is equivalent to (T_i / T_j) = (P_j / P_i)^(1/3)\n# We calculate the candidate answer using this pruned relationship.\nperiod_ratio_j_i = P_j / P_i\ncandidate_temp_ratio = period_ratio_j_i**(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"Constraint 3: Temperature Ratio (T{planet_i}/T{planet_j}) from Radius Ratio\")\n# We can check this by using the radius ratio from Constraint 2\n# temp_ratio_from_radius = (1 / radius_ratio_i_j)**(1/2)\n# The pruned formula is more direct.\nprint(f\"  - Pruned Formula: (T{planet_i}/T{planet_j}) = (P{planet_j}/P{planet_i})^(1/3)\")\nprint(f\"  - Status: PASS (derived from physical principles)\\n\")\n\n# --- Final Candidate Calculation ---\nprint(\"--- Candidate Result ---\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_4 / T_2) is: {candidate_temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n# --- Final Check against options ---\noptions = {'A': 0.75, 'B': 0.69, 'C': 0.57, 'D': 0.83}\nbest_match = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - candidate_temp_ratio))\nprint(f\"The result is closest to option {best_match} ({options[best_match]})\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
