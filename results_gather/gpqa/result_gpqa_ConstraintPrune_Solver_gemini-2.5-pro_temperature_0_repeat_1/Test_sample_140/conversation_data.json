    "This problem can be solved by modeling the chemical reaction as a series of constraints based on the established mechanism for this type of reaction.\n\n**Initial State:**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a deuterium isotope, D, at position 2).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3).\n\n**Constraint-Based Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Determine the Reaction Mechanism.**\n    *   The substrate is an aryl halide, and the reagent is an exceptionally strong base (amide ion, NH2-). These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate.\n    *   This constraint prunes other potential mechanisms like SNAr (which requires electron-withdrawing groups) or SN1/SN2 (not viable on sp2-hybridized carbons of an aromatic ring).\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Identify Possible Benzyne Intermediates.**\n    *   The benzyne intermediate is formed by the base abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n        *   **Path A:** Abstraction of a Hydrogen (H) from position C6.\n        *   **Path B:** Abstraction of a Deuterium (D) from position C2.\n    *   Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily than the C-D bond, so Path A is favored. However, the question asks for *all possible* products, so both pathways must be considered. This leads to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Determine Products from Each Intermediate.**\n    *   The nucleophile (NH2-) attacks the benzyne intermediate. The attack can occur at either carbon of the benzyne's triple bond.\n    *   **Analysis of Path A (H abstraction):**\n        *   Intermediate: A benzyne between C1 and C6, with the Deuterium still at C2. This is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Attack at C1 -> yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 -> yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Analysis of Path B (D abstraction):**\n        *   Intermediate: A benzyne between C1 and C2, with the Deuterium removed. This is a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2 -> both yield **aniline** (non-deuterated), as the new hydrogen comes from the ammonia solvent.\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Consolidate Unique Products.**\n    *   The complete list of possible products generated from all pathways is: 2-deuteroaniline, 3-deuteroaniline, and aniline.\n    *   These three products are structurally distinct.\n\nThe following Python code models this constraint-based deduction process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2/NH3\n    as a constraint satisfaction problem to find the number of unique products.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Task: Find all possible organic products ---\")\n    print(\"Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d\")\n    print(\"Reagent: NaNH2 in condensed NH3\\n\")\n\n    # Constraint 1: The reaction proceeds via a benzyne intermediate.\n    # This is a knowledge-based constraint that prunes other mechanisms.\n    mechanism = \"Elimination-Addition (Benzyne)\"\n    print(\"--- Constraint 1: Reaction Mechanism ---\")\n    print(f\"Candidate mechanism: {mechanism}\")\n    print(\"Pass/Fail: Pass.
