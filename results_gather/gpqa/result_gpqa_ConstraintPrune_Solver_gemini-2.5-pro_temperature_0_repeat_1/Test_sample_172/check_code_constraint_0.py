    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # The problem is governed by two main principles:
    # 1. Heisenberg's Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2
    #    This gives the minimum uncertainty in momentum: Δp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    #
    # 2. The Energy-Momentum Relation for small uncertainties: ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp
    #    A fundamental result is that the group velocity of a particle is v = dE/dp.
    #    This holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.
    #    Therefore, ΔE ≈ v * Δp.
    #
    # Combining these, we get the minimum uncertainty in energy:
    # ΔE_min ≈ v * Δp_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))
