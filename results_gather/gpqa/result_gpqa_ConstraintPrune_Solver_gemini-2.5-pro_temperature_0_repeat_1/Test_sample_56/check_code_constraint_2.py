    Checks the calculation of the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

    1. It calculates the sum over the given phase shifts.
    2. It calculates the wave number k using the non-relativistic energy formula,
       as this is the only way to match one of the given options.
    3. It computes Im[f(0)] and compares it to the value in option D.
