    # --- Step 1: Identify Compound A using Hint (a) ---
    # The reaction is a Wittig reaction. A retro-Wittig analysis on the product,
    # 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, cleaves the C=C double bond.
    # This yields two carbonyl compounds: propan-2-one and 1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one.
    # Since the reaction starts with A, a cyclic compound, A must be the cyclopentanone derivative.
    # The correct IUPAC name for 1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one.
    deduced_A = "3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one"

    # --- Step 2: Verify Compound A with Hint (b) ---
    # The IR spectrum of A (~1750 cm^-1) is characteristic of a cyclopentanone (5-membered ring ketone)
    # due to ring strain.

    # --- Step 3: Trace the Reaction Sequence to deduce Compound E ---
    # The sequence A -> B -> C -> D -> E involves a Tiffeneauâ€“Demjanov rearrangement.
    # This specific rearrangement on the intermediate derived from A causes a ring expansion.
    # A 5-membered ring (cyclopentane) expands to a 6-membered ring (cyclohexane).
    # The two methyl groups on the ring are preserved.
    # Therefore, starting from 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one (A), the final product (E)
    # must be 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.
    deduced_E = "3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one"

    # --- Step 4: Verify Compound E with Hint (b) ---
    # The IR spectrum of E (~1715 cm^-1) is characteristic of a cyclohexanone (6-membered ring ketone),
    # which has less ring strain than a cyclopentanone.

        errors.append(f"Constraint Violation (Hint b): The deduced final product E ('{deduced_E}') is not a cyclohexanone, which contradicts the IR peak at ~1715 cm^-1.")
