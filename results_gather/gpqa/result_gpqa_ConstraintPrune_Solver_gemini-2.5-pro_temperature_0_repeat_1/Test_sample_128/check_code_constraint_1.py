    # Step 1: Deduce Compound A from Hint (a) - Wittig Reaction
    # The Wittig product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
    # Reversing the reaction (replacing =C(CH3)2 with =O) gives 1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one.

        return f"Reason: The deduced Compound A ({compound_a_name}) is not a 5-membered ring ketone, which contradicts the IR hint of ~1750 cm-1."

    # Step 3: Trace the reaction sequence to find Compound E
    # The sequence A -> B -> C -> D -> E is a Tiffeneauâ€“Demjanov rearrangement.
    # This reaction converts a 1-aminoalkyl-cycloalkanol into a ring-expanded ketone.
    # Starting with a cyclopentanone derivative (A), the final product (E) will be a cyclohexanone derivative.
    # The substituent positions are maintained relative to the carbon framework.
    # 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one will expand to 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

    if predicted_e_ring_size != 6 or predicted_e_type != "ketone":
        return f"Reason: The predicted Compound E ({predicted_e_name}) is not a 6-membered ring ketone, which contradicts the IR hint of ~1715 cm-1."
