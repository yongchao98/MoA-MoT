    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the number of loops in a Feynman diagram.

    The core logic relies on two principles from Quantum Field Theory:
    1.  **Loop Factor:** In dimensional regularization, each loop in a Feynman diagram typically contributes a factor of 1/((4*pi)^2) to the amplitude. Therefore, an L-loop diagram will have a factor of 1/((4*pi)^(2L)).
    2.  **Vertex Count:** The powers of the coupling constants in the expression correspond to the number of vertices of each type. The total number of vertices (V) is the sum of these powers.
    3.  **Topological Consistency:** The number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V) are related by the formula L = I - V + 1. For a valid diagram, I must be a non-negative integer.
