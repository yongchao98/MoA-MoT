    # --- Step 1: Dienophile Identification ---
    # Constraint: Anhydride has a single 1H NMR peak and two 13C NMR peaks.
    # Logic: This high degree of symmetry for a C4H2O3 anhydride points uniquely to maleic anhydride.
    # Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons (1 signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons
    # (2 vinylic C's, 2 carbonyl C's), matching the data.
    dienophile = "Maleic Anhydride"
    dienophile_formula = "C4H2O3"
    # This step of the reasoning is sound.

    # --- Step 2: Reaction Verification ---
    # Constraint: Reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield C13H16O3.
    # Logic: The diene's formula is C9H14. The reaction is a Diels-Alder.
    # C9H14 (diene) + C4H2O3 (dienophile) = C13H16O3.

        return f"Reason for incorrectness: The molecular formula check fails. The sum of reactant formulas ({expected_product_formula}) does not match the given product formula ({given_product_formula})."
    # This step of the reasoning is sound.

    # --- Step 3: Stereochemistry Assignment ---
    # Constraint: A major and a minor product are formed.
    # Logic: In a Diels-Alder reaction, this implies the formation of endo and exo stereoisomers.
    # The endo product is the kinetically favored (faster-forming) product and is typically the major product.
    major_product_identity = "endo adduct"
    # This reasoning is a standard assumption in organic chemistry and is correct.

    # --- Step 4: NOESY Correlation Logic ---
    # Constraint: A NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor.
    # Logic: This peak must connect protons that are close in space (<5 Ã…) in the endo adduct but far apart in the exo adduct.
    # In the endo structure, the anhydride protons are positioned directly under the vinylic methyl groups.
    # In the exo structure, they are positioned away from them.
    # Therefore, the unique correlation is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.
    protons_in_unique_correlation = ("anhydride_protons", "vinylic_methyl_protons")
    # This spatial reasoning is the key to the problem and is correct.

    # --- Step 5: Signal Assignment ---
    # Logic: Assign expected NMR signals to the protons from Step 4.
    # Anhydride protons: Two equivalent protons, adjacent to quaternary carbons. Signal: 2H singlet. Shift: Downfield due to carbonyls (~3.5 ppm).
    # Vinylic methyl protons: Two equivalent methyl groups on a C=C double bond. Signal: 6H singlet. Shift: Vinylic methyl region (~1.7 ppm).
