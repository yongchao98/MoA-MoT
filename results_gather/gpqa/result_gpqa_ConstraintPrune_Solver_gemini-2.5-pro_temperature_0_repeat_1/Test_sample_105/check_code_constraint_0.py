    # --- Ground Truth Analysis ---
    # Constraint 1: The Acid Catalyst (A)
    # The first step is enamine formation (cyclohexanone + piperidine), which is a dehydration reaction.
    # To drive this equilibrium reaction to completion, water is typically removed (e.g., via a Dean-Stark trap).
    # TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong organic acid, soluble in organic solvents (like toluene) used for water removal,
    # making it the standard and most favorable catalyst.
    # HCl is usually supplied as an aqueous solution, which would add water and inhibit the reaction.
    # Therefore, the correct catalyst 'A' is TsOH.
    correct_catalyst = 'TsOH'

    # Constraint 2: The Final Product (B)
    # The reaction sequence is:
    # 1. Enamine formation: Cyclohexanone + Piperidine -> Enamine
    # 2. Michael Addition: Enamine + Acrylaldehyde -> Iminium salt intermediate
    # 3. Hydrolysis: The reaction explicitly includes H3O+ workup. This step hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone.
    # The final product 'B' must be the result of this hydrolysis, not the intermediate iminium salt.
    # The hydrolyzed product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal.
    correct_product = '3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal'
