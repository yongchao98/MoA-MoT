def check_stork_enamine_alkylation_answer(llm_answer_str: str) -> str:
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for a Stork enamine alkylation question.

    The reaction involves:
    1. Enamine formation from cyclohexanone and piperidine, catalyzed by acid (A).
    2. Michael addition of the enamine to acrylaldehyde.
    3. Hydrolysis (H3O+) to yield the final product (B).

    Args:
        llm_answer_str: The string containing the LLM's answer, e.g., "<<<C>>>".

    Returns:
        A string indicating "Correct" or the reason for being incorrect.

    # 1. Favorable Catalyst (A): For enamine formation, a mild acid like p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH)
    #    is preferred over a strong acid like HCl. Strong acids can fully protonate the secondary amine,
    #    making it non-nucleophilic and inhibiting the reaction.

    # 2. Final Product (B): The reaction specifies an H3O+ workup. This hydrolyzes the iminium salt
    #    intermediate formed after the Michael addition.
