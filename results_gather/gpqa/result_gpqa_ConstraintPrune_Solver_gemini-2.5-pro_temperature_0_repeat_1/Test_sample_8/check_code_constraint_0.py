    This function verifies the correct molecule with C3h symmetry.

    A molecule has C3h symmetry if it satisfies all the following conditions:
    1. It has a C3 principal axis of rotation (120-degree rotation).
    2. It has a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h) perpendicular to the C3 axis.
    3. It does NOT have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (otherwise, its point group would be D3h).
