            "2. **Polarizability (Atom Identity):** Nucleophilicity increases down a group in the periodic table for a protic solvent. Sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, making Ethanethiolate (5) the most reactive nucleophile.\n"
            "3. **Resonance:** Among the remaining oxygen anions (1, 2, 3), Propionate (3) has its negative charge delocalized by resonance. This stabilization makes it a much weaker nucleophile than the other two.\n"
            "4. **Steric Hindrance:** Comparing the non-resonant oxygen anions, Hydroxide (2) is significantly smaller and less sterically hindered than the bulky 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1). This makes Hydroxide the more effective nucleophile.\n\n"
            "Therefore, the correct order from most to least reactive is: Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4)."
