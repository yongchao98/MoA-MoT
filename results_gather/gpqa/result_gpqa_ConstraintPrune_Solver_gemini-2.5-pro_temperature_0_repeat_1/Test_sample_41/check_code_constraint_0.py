    # --- Step 1: Relate temperature ratios to orbital distance (semi-major axis) ratios ---
    # The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    # Therefore, T_i / T_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i), which rearranges to a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)^2.

    # --- Step 2: Combine the distance ratios to find the total ratio a3/a1 ---
    # The overall ratio a3/a1 is the product of the intermediate ratios: (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)
    a3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1

    # --- Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to find the orbital period ratio ---
    # Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, P^2 is proportional to a^3.
    # Therefore, (P_j / P_i)^2 = (a_j / a_i)^3, which rearranges to P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).
