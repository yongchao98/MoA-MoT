    # --- Physics Principles and Derivation ---
    # 1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq): For a planet in a circular orbit around a star,
    #    T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), where 'a' is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).
    #    So, T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    #    This means the ratio of temperatures for two planets (i, j) is T_i / T_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i).

    # 2. Kepler's Third Law: The square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).
    #    P^2 ∝ a^3, which means P ∝ a^(3/2).
    #    The ratio of periods is P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).

    # 3. Combining the two principles to relate Period and Temperature:
    #    From (1), we can write a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)^2.
    #    Substitute this into (2): P_j / P_i = [ (T_i / T_j)^2 ]^(3/2)
    #    This simplifies to: P_j / P_i = (T_i / T_j)^3.

    # --- Calculation ---
    # We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1.
    # Using the derived formula with i=1 and j=3: P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3.
    
    # First, calculate the temperature ratio T1 / T3:
    # T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3)
    T1_over_T3 = T1_over_T2 * T2_over_T3
    
    # Now, calculate the period ratio P3 / P1:
    calculated_period_ratio = T1_over_T3 ** 3
