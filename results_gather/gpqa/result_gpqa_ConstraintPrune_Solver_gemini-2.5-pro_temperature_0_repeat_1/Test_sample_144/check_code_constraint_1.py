    Analyzes the structure of 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol
    to verify the number of stereoisomers.

    The verification process involves:
    1.  Deconstructing the IUPAC name to understand the molecule's structure.
    2.  Identifying chiral centers (carbons with four unique substituents).
    3.  Identifying geometric centers (double bonds capable of E/Z isomerism).
    4.  Calculating the total number of stereoisomers using the formula 2^n.
    5.  Comparing the calculated result with the provided answer's reasoning and final value.
