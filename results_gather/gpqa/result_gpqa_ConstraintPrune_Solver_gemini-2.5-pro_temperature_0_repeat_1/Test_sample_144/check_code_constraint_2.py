    6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

    # The groups on C2 are: -H, -CH3 (from C1), -CH3 (the substituent), and the rest of the chain (-CH=CH...).
    # Since two of the groups are identical (-CH3), C2 is NOT chiral.
    
    # Analysis of C5 (5-ol):
    # The groups on C5 are: -H, -OH, the chain towards C4 (-CH=CH-CH(CH3)2), and the chain towards C6 (-CH(Cl)-CH=...).
    # These four groups are all different from each other. Therefore, C5 is a chiral center.

    # These four groups are all different. Therefore, C6 is a chiral center.
