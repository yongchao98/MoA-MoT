    "The task is to calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X given its production energy, mass, and decay width. This problem can be modeled by a set of physical constraints derived from special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n**Constraint 1: Proper Lifetime**\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$). For a resonance, this is expressed as $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The proper decay length, $c\\tau_0$, is the distance light travels in one proper lifetime. This value must be a positive real number.\n\n**Constraint 2: Relativistic Dilation**\nSince the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime in the laboratory frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E_X$) to its rest energy ($m_X c^2$), so $\\gamma = E_X / m_X$. For the particle to be physically real and moving, its energy must be greater than its rest mass, meaning $\\gamma > 1$.\n\n**Constraint 3: Mean Decay Distance**\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels during its dilated lifetime ($\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$) at its velocity ($v = \\beta c$).\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma \\cdot (c\\tau_0)$.\nThe term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the Lorentz factor as $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nThe final calculated distance must match one of the provided options.\n\nWe will now use these constraints to prune the search space and find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values and constants ---\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # GeV/c^2 (in natural units, m_X = 1.2 GeV)\nGamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n# Convert Gamma_X to GeV for consistent units\nGamma_X_GeV = Gamma_X / 1000.0  # 0.320 GeV\n\n# Physical constant hbar*c in GeV*m\n# hbar*c = 197.3269804 MeV*fm = 0.1973269804 GeV*fm\n# 1 fm = 1e-15 m\nhbar_c_GeV_m = 0.1973269804 * 1e-15  # GeV*m\n\n# --- Candidate Answers ---\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": 5.0223e-15,\n    \"B\": 4.0655e-16,\n    \"C\": 4.0655e-15,\n    \"D\": 5.0223e-16,\n}\n\n# --- Constraint 1: Proper Decay Length (c*tau_0) ---\n# c*tau_0 = hbar*c / Gamma_X\nc_tau0 = hbar_c_GeV_m / Gamma_X_GeV\nprint(f\"Constraint 1: Proper Decay Length (c*tau_0)\")\nprint(f\"  c*tau_0 = {c_tau0:.4e} m\")\nif c_tau0 > 0:\n    print(\"  Pass: Proper decay length is positive.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"  Fail: Proper decay length is not positive.\\n\")\n\n# --- Constraint 2: Relativistic Dilation Factor (beta*gamma) ---\n# gamma = E_X / m_X\ngamma = E_X / m_X\n# beta*gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nbeta_gamma = math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\nprint(f\"Constraint 2: Relativistic Dilation\")\nprint(f\"  Lorentz factor gamma = {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  Relativistic factor beta*gamma = {beta_gamma:.4f}\")\nif gamma > 1:\n    print(\"  Pass: Particle is relativistic (E > m).\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"  Fail: Particle cannot exist or is at rest (E <= m).\\n\")\n\n# --- Constraint 3: Mean Decay Distance (L) ---\n# L = beta*gamma * c*tau_0\nL_calculated = beta_gamma * c_tau0\nprint(f\"Constraint 3: Mean Decay Distance (L)\")\nprint(f\"  Calculated L = {L_calculated:.4e} m\")\n\n# Check which candidate matches the calculation\npassing_candidates = []\nfor key, value in candidates.items():\n    # Check for a match within a small tolerance (e.g., 0.1%)\n    if math.isclose(L_calculated, value, rel_tol=1e-3):\n        passing_candidates.append(key)\n\nif len(passing_candidates) == 1:\n    print(f\"  Pass: Calculated value matches candidate {passing_candidates[0]}.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"  Fail: Calculated value does not uniquely match a candidate.\\n\")\n\n# --- Final Result ---\nprint(\"--- Final Check ---\")\nfor key, value in candidates.items():\n    is_pass = \"Pass\" if key in passing_candidates else \"Fail\"\n    print(f\"Candidate {key} ({value:.4e} m): {is_pass}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
