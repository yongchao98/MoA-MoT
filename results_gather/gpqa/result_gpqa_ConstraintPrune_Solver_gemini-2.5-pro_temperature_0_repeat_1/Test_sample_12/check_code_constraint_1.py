    # --- Step-by-Step Chemical Analysis ---

    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene
    # Reaction: (R)-Limonene + H2 (1 eq.), Pd/C
    # Analysis: Catalytic hydrogenation selectively reduces the more reactive, less substituted
    # exocyclic double bond (isopropenyl group) over the trisubstituted endocyclic double bond.
    # The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.
    # Product 1: (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.
    # Stereochemistry: C4=R.
    product_1_config = {"C4": "R"}

    # Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1
    # Reaction: Product 1 + mCPBA
    # Analysis: mCPBA forms an epoxide across the C1=C2 double bond. The bulky isopropyl group
    # at C4 directs the epoxidation to the opposite face of the ring (anti-attack).
    # For a starting material with C4=R, this stereoselective attack results in the
    # major epoxide diastereomer having (1S,2R,4R) configuration.
    # Product 2: (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-1-methyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.
    product_2_config = {"C1": "S", "C2": "R", "C4": "R"}

    # Step 3: Epoxide Ring Opening
    # Reaction: Product 2 + Sodium Methoxide (NaOMe)
    # Analysis: Under basic conditions (NaOMe), the methoxide nucleophile (MeO-) attacks
    # the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C2 (tertiary) rather than
    # C1 (quaternary). The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates that
    # the attack occurs with *inversion* of configuration at the attacked stereocenter.
    # - Attack at C2 inverts its configuration from R to S.
    # - The configuration at C1 is retained (S).
    # - The configuration at C4 is unaffected (R).
    # Product 3: (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.
    product_3_config = {"C1": "S", "C2": "S", "C4": "R"}

    # Step 4: Steglich Esterification
    # Reaction: Product 3 + Propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP
    # Analysis: This reaction converts the alcohol at C1 into a propionate ester.
    # The reaction mechanism does not break the C1-O bond, so the stereochemistry
    # of all chiral centers is retained.
    # Derived Product 4: (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

            f"Reasoning:\n"
            f"The error originates in Step 3, the epoxide ring opening. The nucleophilic attack of methoxide on the (1S,2R,4R)-epoxide occurs at the less hindered C2 position via an S_N2 mechanism. A fundamental rule of the S_N2 reaction is the inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon center being attacked. Therefore, the R configuration at C2 in the epoxide must be inverted to an S configuration in the final product. The provided answer C incorrectly assumes retention of configuration at C2, which contradicts the established reaction mechanism."
