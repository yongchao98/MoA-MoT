    # --- Constraint 2 & 3: Stereochemistry of Epoxide Opening and Esterification ---
    # Step 3: Product 2 (epoxide) is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe).
    # This is a nucleophilic ring-opening under basic conditions.
    # - Regioselectivity Rule: The nucleophile (MeO-) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon (C2, which is secondary) rather than the more hindered one (C1, which is tertiary).
    # - Stereoselectivity Rule: The reaction is an SN2 attack, causing INVERSION of configuration at the attacked carbon (C2).
    #
    # Step 4: Product 3 (alcohol) undergoes Steglich esterification.
    # - Stereoselectivity Rule: This reaction proceeds with RETENTION of configuration at all stereocenters of the alcohol.
    
    # --- Combined Stereochemical Consequence ---
    # The stereochemistry of the final product (Product 4) is determined by the epoxide opening.
    # The configuration at C2 in Product 4 must be the INVERSE of the configuration at C2 in the epoxide (Product 2).
    # The LLM's analysis correctly deduces the epoxide (Product 2) as having (1S, 2S, 4R) stereochemistry.
    # Therefore, the stereocenter C2 is (2S) in the epoxide.
    # After inversion, C2 must be (2R) in Product 3 and, by retention, also in Product 4.
