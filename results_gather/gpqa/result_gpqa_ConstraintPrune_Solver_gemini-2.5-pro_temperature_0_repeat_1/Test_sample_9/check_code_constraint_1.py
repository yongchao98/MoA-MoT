def check_exoplanet_density_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer about exoplanet density.

    The core principle is that for a planet of a given composition (like Earth),
    density increases with mass due to gravitational self-compression. A simplified
    but physically-based mass-radius relationship for rocky planets is R ∝ M^k,
    where k is approximately 0.27.

    From this, we can derive the relationship between density (ρ) and mass (M):
    ρ = M/V ∝ M/R^3 ∝ M/(M^k)^3 ∝ M / M^(3k) ∝ M^(1-3k)
    Since k ≈ 0.27 < 1/3, the exponent (1-3k) is positive, meaning density
    increases with mass.
