    "The task is to determine which of the four described exoplanets has the highest density. The core principle to apply is that for planets of the same composition, a more massive planet will experience greater gravitational self-compression, leading to a higher overall density.\n\n**Constraint 1: Define a baseline density.**\n- Planet (a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Its density is, by definition, the density of Earth (ρ_earth).\n- Planet (b) has a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is the approximate density of Earth.\n- Let's set the baseline density ρ_base = 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Constraint 2: Evaluate planets against the baseline.**\n- Planet (a): Has a density of ρ_earth ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n- Planet (b): Is explicitly stated to have a density of ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n- Planet (d): Has the same composition as Earth but half the mass. Less mass means less gravitational compression. Therefore, its density must be *less than* Earth's density. ρ_d < 5.5 g/cm³.\n- Planet (c): Has the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass. More mass means greater gravitational compression. Therefore, its density must be *greater than* Earth's density. ρ_c > 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Pruning the Search Space:**\n- We can immediately prune planet (d) as its density is the lowest.\n- We can prune planets (a) and (b) as their densities are approximately equal to the baseline, while planet (c) has a density strictly greater than the baseline.\n\nThis leaves planet (c) as the only candidate for the highest density.\n\n```python\n# Define Earth's properties as a baseline\nearth_density = 5.5  # g/cm^3\n\n# --- Candidate Definitions ---\n# Note: For c and d, we use a simplified mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, R ∝ M^0.25\n# Density (rho) = Mass / Volume; Volume ∝ Radius^3\n# So, rho ∝ M / R^3 ∝ M / (M^0.25)^3 ∝ M / M^0.75 ∝ M^0.25\n# This shows density increases with mass for planets of the same composition.\n\ncandidates = {\n    \"a\": {\"mass_me\": 1.0, \"radius_re\": 1.0, \"description\": \"An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\"},\n    \"b\": {\"mass_me\": 2.0, \"density_gcc\": 5.5, \"description\": \"A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\"},\n    \"c\": {\"mass_me\": 5.0, \"composition\": \"Earth-like\", \"description\": \"A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\"},\n    \"d\": {\"mass_me\": 0.5, \"composition\": \"Earth-like\", \"description\": \"A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\"}\n}\n\n# --- Constraint Evaluation ---\n\n# Constraint 1: Density must be greater than or equal to Earth's density to be a potential maximum.\nprint(\"--- Constraint 1: Density >= Earth's Density (5.5 g/cm^3) ---\")\npass_candidates_1 = []\nfor key, props in candidates.items():\n    density = 0\n    if key == 'a':\n        density = earth_density\n    elif key == 'b':\n        density = props[\"density_gcc\"]\n    elif key == 'c':\n        # Density increases with mass for same composition: rho ~ M^0.25\n        # So density will be > earth_density\n        density = earth_density * (props[\"mass_me\"] ** 0.25)\n    elif key == 'd':\n        # Density decreases with less mass for same composition\n        density = earth_density * (props[\"mass_me\"] ** 0.25)\n\n    # Store calculated density for final check\n    candidates[key]['calculated_density'] = density\n\n    if density >= earth_density:\n        status = \"Pass\"\n        pass_candidates_1.append(key)\n    else:\n        status = \"Fail (Pruned)\"\n    print(f\"Candidate {key}: Calculated Density ~{density:.2f} g/cm^3.

    "Excellent. The checker confirms that the analysis and conclusion are correct.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the physical principle of gravitational self-compression:\n\n1.  **Baseline Density:** Planet (a) and Planet (b) both have a density approximately equal to that of Earth (~5.5 g/cm³).\n2.  **Pruning Low Density:** Planet (d) has the same composition as Earth but only half the mass. Less mass results in weaker gravity and therefore less compression, making it *less dense* than Earth. It can be eliminated.\n3.  **Identifying High Density:** Planet (c) has the same composition as Earth but five times the mass. The significantly greater mass results in much stronger gravitational compression, making it *more dense* than Earth.\n\nTherefore, Planet (c) has the highest density among the given options."
