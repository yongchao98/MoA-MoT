    "The user wants to identify two starting materials, A and B, based on the products of two different reduction reactions.\n\n### Constraint Modeling\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Materials and Products:**\n    *   The potential starting materials are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an isobutyl ester. The stereocenter is at carbon-3.\n    *   The products are enantiomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). The stereocenter is at carbon-4.\n    *   The formation of the lactone involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular cyclization (esterification) which closes the ring.\n    *   Crucially, the stereocenter at C3 of the starting material becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the product. The reactions described (reduction and lactonization) do not invert the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: Reaction A**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and ketones but does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH4` reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes the cyclization of the resulting hydroxy-acid to form the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, the configuration of starting material A must match the configuration of the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce the (R)-lactone, starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Reaction B**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH3`) is a selective reducing agent that readily reduces carboxylic acids but does **not** typically reduce esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH3` reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction also does not affect the stereocenter. The configuration of starting material B must match the configuration of the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce the (S)-lactone, starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Pruning the Search Space\n\n*   Constraint 1 (`A` must be R) eliminates options B and D.\n*   Constraint 2 (`B` must be S) eliminates options A and B.\n*   The only option satisfying both constraints is C.\n\nThe following code formalizes this pruning process.\n\n```python\n# Define the chemical structures based on their stereochemistry\nR_ACID = \"(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\"\nS_ACID = \"(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\"\n\n# Define the candidates based on the provided options\ncandidates = {\n    \"A\": {\"A\": R_ACID, \"B\": R_ACID},\n    \"B\": {\"A\": S_ACID, \"B\": S_ACID},\n    \"C\": {\"A\": R_ACID, \"B\": S_ACID},\n    \"D\": {\"A\": S_ACID, \"B\": R_ACID},\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Evaluating Candidates ---\")\n\n# Constraint 1: A + LiBH4 -> (R)-product.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester.
