    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry problem.

    The core logic is based on the stereochemical outcome of the reactions.
    1.  The starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanoic acid, with a chiral center at C3.
    2.  The product is a lactone where the chiral center is at C4.
    3.  The reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, act on the carbonyl groups (ester and carboxylic acid), which are not the chiral center.
    4.  Therefore, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained during the reaction. An (R) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (S) starting material will yield an (S) product.
