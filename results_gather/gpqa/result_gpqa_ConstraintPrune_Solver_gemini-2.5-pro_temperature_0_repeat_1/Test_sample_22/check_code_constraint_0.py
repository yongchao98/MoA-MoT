    # --- 2. Apply Chemical Principles to Predict Products ---
    
    # Principle 1: The reaction is an acid-catalyzed intramolecular electrophilic substitution.
    # H+ from HBr protonates the alkene.
    
    # Principle 2: Protonation follows Markovnikov's rule to form the most stable carbocation.
    # H+ adds to the terminal CH2 of the double bond, forming a secondary carbocation.
    # Intermediate 1: Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH(+)-CH3
    
    # Principle 3: This carbocation has two competing, favorable reaction pathways, explaining the two products.
    
    # Pathway A: Direct Cyclization (No Rearrangement)
    # The nucleophilic benzene ring (ortho position) attacks the secondary carbocation.
    # This forms a 6-membered ring.
    # Product from Pathway A: "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"
    
    # Pathway B: Rearrangement then Cyclization
    # The secondary carbocation rearranges via a 1,2-methyl shift to a more stable tertiary carbocation.
    # Intermediate 2: Ph-O-CH2-C(+)(CH3)-CH(CH3)2
    # The benzene ring then attacks this new carbocation.
    # This forms a 5-membered ring.
    # Product from Pathway B: "3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran"
