The sequence correctly installs a meta-directing acetyl group first, followed by bromination and nitration. Both subsequent substitutions are directed to the correct meta positions, leading to the desired 1,3,5-trisubstituted product in high yield. The initial steps of this option successfully create the target molecule.\n\nThe analysis concludes that option D is the only chemically sound pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful sequence of reactions is required to ensure the substituents are placed at the correct positions (1, 3, and 5). This involves considering the directing effects of each group added to the benzene ring. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) all in a meta relationship to each other.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the most effective synthesis strategy, which aligns with the steps presented in one of the options:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring. This is achieved by reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director and deactivates the ring for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n\n2.  **Bromination:** The second step is the bromination of acetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, it will direct the incoming bromine atom to the meta (position 3) position. This reaction is carried out using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst such as iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** The final step is to introduce the nitro group. At this stage, the benzene ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 (meta-director) and a bromine atom at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   When directing effects are in conflict, the position that is least sterically hindered and electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both existing groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group strongly directs meta to itself, and the bromo group directs ortho/para. Position 5 is ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group. More importantly, in a 1,3-disubstituted ring, substitution at the 5-position is strongly favored as both groups direct the incoming electrophile to this position. This reaction, using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), yields the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is the most direct and high-yield pathway. However, the options provided are more complex, suggesting a misunderstanding in the premise of the question options. Based on the most chemically sound principles for achieving the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern, a sequence starting with acylation, followed by the introduction of the other two groups, is the correct approach. The other options fail because they either perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated ring (which is not feasible), or they follow a sequence of directing effects that would not lead to the 1,3,5-product.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options based on this correct three-step synthesis: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. This sequence is a truncated version of option D. The additional steps in option D (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) are nonsensical and incorrect in that order. However, since the initial three steps of option D are the only chemically logical start to forming a 1,3,5-substituted acetophenone derivative, it is the most plausible choice despite its flawed later steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Re-evaluating the Options Based on Chemical Principles\n\nMy initial logical deduction led to a simple three-step synthesis: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**\n2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone** (Acetyl is a meta-director).\n3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Both acetyl and nitro are meta-directors, reinforcing the substitution at position 5).\n\nThis pathway is chemically sound. However, it is not listed as an option. The options provided are more complex, suggesting that this direct route may have issues, such as low yield in the final bromination step due to the ring being strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions also fail on strongly deactivated rings.\n\nLet's meticulously re-examine the provided options, keeping in mind the directing effects of substituents and the possibility of using a functional group as a temporary director before removing it (e.g., via deamination).\n\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option A\n\n**i) Br2/FeBr3:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n**ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Bromobenzene → Mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The bromine is an o,p-director. This step does not produce the required meta-substituted precursor in high yield.\n**Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect as it fails to establish the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern from the beginning.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\n**i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n**ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n**iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Aniline's lone pair reacts with the Lewis acid (AlCl3), deactivating the ring so strongly that Friedel-Crafts acylation does not occur. Instead, N-acylation would happen. Assuming the intended reaction was N-acylation to form acetanilide, the -NHCOCH3 group is an o,p-director.\n**iv) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetanilide → 4-Bromoacetanilide (major product).\nThis pathway leads to para-substitution, which is inconsistent with the target molecule's 1,3,5-pattern.\n**Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option D\n\n**i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n**ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n**iii) NaNO2/HCl:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n**iv) H3PO2:** Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene. This sequence just reduces the nitro group and then removes it, returning to the starting material.\n**Conclusion:** Option D is nonsensical.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option C\n\nThis option is the only remaining possibility and must be the correct one. Let's trace the steps carefully to understand the synthetic strategy.\n\n**i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n*   This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n\n**ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n*   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position.\n\n**iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → **1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   This is the most complex step to analyze. The ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (o,p-director) at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n*   In cases of conflicting directing effects, the outcome depends on the relative activating/deactivating strength and steric factors. Both groups are deactivating. The -COCH3 group is a stronger deactivator than -Br. Often, the directing effect of existing groups will lead to a mixture of products. However, in this specific case, the nitration is known to proceed to the C5 position. The position is meta to the strongest deactivating group (-COCH3) and ortho to the weaker deactivating group (-Br). This gives the desired product. The subsequent steps in the option (iv, v, vi, vii) seem superfluous if this step directly yields the final product.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of the question or the options provided. Let's reconsider the possibility that the sequence in Option C is designed to overcome a low-yield or difficult reaction. What if step (iii) is not nitration but another reaction, or if the sequence is different?\n\nLet's re-read the question and options. It's possible there's a typo in the option and it's meant to be a different sequence. However, assuming the option is written as intended, there is a significant logical inconsistency. The sequence `iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2` appears to be a jumble of reactions that don't logically follow to create the target molecule from 3-bromoacetophenone. For instance, reducing a nitro group that hasn't been added yet (Fe/HCl) makes no sense.\n\nLet's ignore the nonsensical tail end of option C (steps iv-vii) and focus on the initial, logical steps.\n*   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n*   **Step 2: Bromination.** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is chemically viable. It is possible that Option C is the intended answer, despite the confusing and incorrect additional steps listed. The core of the correct synthesis is likely embedded in the beginning of this option.\n\nLet's try the other order of bromination and nitration:\n*   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n*   **Step 2: Nitration.** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n*   **Step 3: Bromination.** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   In this case, both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are strong meta-directors. They work together to direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This is a very clean reaction with reinforcing directing effects, likely leading to a higher yield than the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\nSince this superior sequence (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not an option, we must choose the best among the given choices. Options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed from the early steps. Option C contains the correct starting sequence (Acylation -> Bromination) which can, in principle, lead to the desired substitution pattern, even if it's not the highest-yield method and even if the subsequent steps listed are incorrect. Given the format of the question, it is most probable that the intended answer is the one that contains the most plausible synthetic route, despite any errors. The first three steps of C represent a plausible, if not optimal, synthesis.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Wrong regiochemistry from step ii.\n*   B: Wrong reaction at step iii (F-C fails) and wrong regiochemistry.\n*   D: Nonsensical sequence (deamination back to benzene).\n*   C: Steps i and ii are correct for building a 1,3-disubstituted precursor. Step iii (nitration) is plausible, although it might give mixtures. The remaining steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as written. However, compared to the other options, C is the only one that begins with a logical sequence toward the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2), all in a meta relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the options and the chemical principles involved:\n\n*   **Substituent Effects:** In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the order in which substituents are added is crucial.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the nitro group (-NO2) are electron-withdrawing and are **meta-directors**.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br) is deactivating but is an **ortho-, para-director**.\n    *   Friedel-Crafts reactions, such as acylation (adding the -COCH3 group), fail on strongly deactivated rings, like those bearing a nitro group, or on rings with an amino group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n        This sequence begins with bromination, followed by nitration. The third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, is attempted on a bromo-nitro-benzene ring. The presence of the deactivating nitro group makes this step non-viable.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n        This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline (-NH2). The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n    *   **Option D:** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the group). This would return the molecule to benzene, which is not a productive synthesis route.\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n        1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is a standard and effective first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n        2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a logical step.\n        3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho-, para-director (-Br). These groups have conflicting directing effects, which would typically lead to a mixture of products, thus not providing a \"high-yield\" of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one isomer.\n\n*   **Optimal Synthesis vs. Provided Options:**\n    The most efficient, high-yield synthesis would involve an order of reactions where the directing effects of the substituents are cooperative. This would be:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The -COCH3 group directs meta).\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are meta-directors and they cooperatively direct the bromine to the 5-position).\n\n    This optimal sequence is not listed as an option. However, when evaluating the given choices, options A, C, and D contain steps that are known to fail. Option B is the only sequence where the initial steps are chemically viable and lead towards the target molecule, even if the yield in the third step is compromised by competing directing effects. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) in the option are nonsensical for producing the final target and appear to be erroneous. By elimination of the unfeasible options, B remains the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the relationship between the substituents. The acetyl group is at position 1. The bromo group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group). The nitro group is at position 5 (also meta to the acetyl group). The bromo and nitro groups are meta to each other. This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is crucial, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Correct reduction of a nitro group.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-). This complex is very strongly deactivating, preventing the acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Correct bromination.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration. The -Br group is an o,p-director, giving a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\n*   **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on rings bearing a nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This is a deamination reaction. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is illogical for synthesizing the target molecule.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group. This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a strong meta-director (-COCH3 at position 1) and a weak o,p-director (-Br at position 3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group dominates, directing the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (position 5). This gives the desired target molecule. This is a known and effective transformation.\n*   **Steps iv) - vii):** These steps are performed on the final product. They involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence is nonsensical for the synthesis of the target molecule and appears to be included as a distractor. The synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a chemically sound and high-yield route to the target molecule in its first three steps. The other options contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or are logically flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine the optimal reaction sequence.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone.\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5, meaning all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nTo achieve a high yield, the substituents should be introduced in an order that utilizes their directing effects advantageously. The presence of three substituents all *meta* to each other suggests that the synthesis should prioritize the use of *meta*-directing groups to control the substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate the two most plausible synthetic routes:\n\n**Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. This correctly places the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director, on the ring.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the 3-position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone is brominated using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr3). Now, the ring has two *meta*-directing groups (acetyl at C1, nitro at C3). Both groups direct the incoming bromine to the 5-position. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to a high yield of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration (as suggested by the start of Option C)**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone is nitrated. In this case, the directing effects of the existing substituents are in conflict. The acetyl group (at C1) directs *meta* (to C5), while the bromo group (at C3) directs *ortho* and *para* (to C2, C4, and C6). While the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, will be one of the products, other isomers will also be formed, leading to a lower yield compared to Route 1.\n\n**Evaluation of the Given Options:**\n\n*   **Option A and D:** These options begin with nitration. The subsequent step in both is a Friedel-Crafts reaction (or preparation for one) on a highly deactivated nitrobenzene or aniline ring. Friedel-Crafts reactions are known to fail on rings with strongly deactivating groups like -NO2 or on amines. Therefore, these options are not viable.\n*   **Option B:** This option begins with bromination, followed by nitration, which produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the required meta arrangement. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation on the deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would also be unsuccessful.\n*   **Option C:** This option begins with the sequence: i) Acylation, ii) Bromination, iii) Nitration. As analyzed in Route 2, the first three steps of this sequence do produce the target molecule, although perhaps not with the highest possible yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically illogical for this synthesis and appear to be erroneous. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental flaws preventing the synthesis, the initial part of Option C represents a valid, albeit suboptimal, pathway.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most efficient, high-yield synthesis follows the sequence: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. This exact sequence is not presented as a complete option. However, Option C starts with a plausible, if less efficient, sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) that does lead to the desired product. The other options are fundamentally flawed. Therefore, Option C is the only choice that contains a correct synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\nThis molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern (1,3,5) is crucial for determining the correct synthetic route.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group (by induction) but an *ortho, para*-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating, making the Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring fail. The primary reaction would be N-acylation. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.\niv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply converts benzene back to benzene, making the first four steps pointless. The synthesis then restarts from benzene.\nv) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nvi) Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is an *o,p*-director and para is sterically favored).\nvii) 4-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring has a -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and a -COCH3 at C4 (m-director). The -Br directs to C2 and C6. The -COCH3 directs to C3 and C5. The directing effects do not align to produce the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The major product would be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the target molecule.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\niii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2), and Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is correct.\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring now has a -COCH3 group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a -Br group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) much less reactive towards electrophilic attack. The least deactivated position is C5 (meta to the acetyl group). Therefore, nitration will preferentially occur at C5.\n    *   This reaction yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the desired target molecule.\n\nThe synthesis is successfully completed in these first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv to vii) are superfluous for synthesizing the target molecule and are likely an error in the question's formulation. However, since the initial part of sequence C provides a valid and high-yield route to the desired product, and all other options contain fatal flaws, option C is the correct choice.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Start with benzene.\n2.  Introduce a *meta*-director: Acylation to get acetophenone.\n3.  Introduce a second substituent *meta* to the first: Bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n4.  Introduce the third substituent: Nitration. The combined directing effects lead to substitution at C5, resulting in the 1,3,5 pattern. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, we need to add the groups in a specific order. A key principle for synthesizing polysubstituted benzenes is to consider the directing effects at each step.\n\nA powerful strategy for obtaining 1,3,5-trisubstituted products where at least two groups are *meta*-directors is to install a *meta*-director first, followed by another, and then a third. The two *meta*-directing groups will reinforce each other, directing the third substituent to the position *meta* to both.\n\nLet's evaluate this strategy:\n*   **Path A: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → m-Nitroacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position (C3). Now we have two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    3.  **m-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. This is a reinforcing effect, leading to high regioselectivity for the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated, this pathway is highly selective and is a standard method for this synthesis.\n\n*   **Path B: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → m-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming Br+ to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **m-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ???**: Now we have a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br at C3). Their directing effects are in conflict. The -COCH3 group directs to C5, while the -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. This will lead to a mixture of products (mainly 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone), making it a low-yield synthesis for the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer.\n\nFrom this analysis, Path A is superior for a high-yield synthesis. However, this exact 3-step sequence is not listed as an option. The options are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex route, possibly involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed (indicated by the Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2 sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the provided multi-step options.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) Nitration, ii) Reduction, iii) Diazotization, iv) Deamination. This sequence (HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO2/HCl -> H3PO2) converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to the benzenediazonium ion, and finally back to benzene. This is a futile sequence. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Bromination, ii) Nitration. This produces p-bromonitrobenzene as the major product. Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. It then attempts a series of substitutions on the aniline ring before a final deamination. Detailed analysis of the directing effects at each stage shows that this path is very unlikely to produce the target isomer. For instance, after forming 3-bromo-5-aminoacetophenone (assuming this intermediate is formed), the subsequent nitration would not selectively occur at the desired position to form the precursor for the final product.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    The first three steps correspond to Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration). As discussed, step (iii) of this sequence is not highly selective and would result in a low yield of the desired isomer. However, compared to the other options, this sequence at least starts by installing the substituents in a way that *could* lead to the product, even if inefficiently. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and deamination seem misplaced and nonsensical if the product were already formed in step (iii). For example, applying steps (iv)-(vii) to the major product of step (iii) (3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone) does not lead to the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question's options, as none describe a clean, high-yield synthesis. The best and most direct synthesis is the 3-step \"Path A\" (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination).\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option among the given choices:\n*   Options B and D are fundamentally flawed and cannot work.\n*   Option A leads to incorrect isomers based on directing effects.\n*   Option C outlines a possible, albeit low-yield, synthesis in its first three steps (Path B). The remaining steps are nonsensical in this context. It is the most plausible starting sequence among the choices, as it correctly establishes a 1,3-relationship between two of the groups. It's possible the question assumes the problematic nitration step (iii) works with acceptable yield, making C the intended answer despite the superfluous later steps.\n\nGiven the elimination of other options, Option C is the most likely intended answer, representing the Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration route, despite its chemical drawbacks and the confusing additional steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nI have analyzed the reaction sequences and confirmed the key step in option D.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target:** The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). They are in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): Deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option D:**\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly adds the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is a bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta-position (C3). This step is correct.\n    *   **iii) 3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is a nitration. We have two groups on the ring: acetyl at C1 (meta-director) and bromo at C3 (ortho/para-director).\n        *   The acetyl group directs the nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   As confirmed by the provided information and chemical principles, the directing effect of the acetyl group to the C5 position prevails, leading to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This step correctly forms the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze Other Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with bromination (o,p-director), so the next substitution (nitration) would primarily give the 1,4-product, not the 1,3-product needed.\n    *   **B)** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, and then deamination. This sequence (i-iv) just converts benzene back to benzene, which is illogical.\n    *   **C)** Starts with nitration and reduction to form aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails on the highly activated (and basic) aniline ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions in option D (steps i, ii, and iii) is the only one that correctly synthesizes the target molecule with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and incorrect, but the initial, crucial part of the synthesis is correct only in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a careful sequence of reactions to ensure the correct placement of the three substituents on the benzene ring. The key is to consider the directing effects of each group as it is added. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nA logical and high-yield synthesis route is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation of Benzene:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring using acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is crucial for placing the next substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n\n2.  **Bromination of Acetophenone:** The next step is the bromination of acetophenone using bromine (Br2) and a catalyst like iron(III) bromide (FeBr3). Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom will be added to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n\n3.  **Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Now, we have two directing groups on the ring: the acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-directing) and the bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-directing).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In this case of competing directors, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups is the most deactivated. However, the positions that are *meta* to the acetyl group (C5) and *ortho/para* to the bromo group (C2, C4, C6) must be considered. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group and also *meta* to the bromo group. The position C4 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *para* to the bromo group. The position C2 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group. While complex, the synthesis proceeds to place the nitro group at the C5 position, yielding the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This specific substitution pattern is known and the compound is commercially available.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The additional steps in option C (iv, v, vi, vii) involve reduction of a nitro group, another nitration, and then diazotization and removal of a group, which are unnecessarily complex and incorrect for synthesizing the target molecule which retains a nitro group. However, among the choices provided, the initial sequence of option C is the only chemically sound pathway to begin the synthesis. The question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the initial steps of C are the correct ones. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their initial steps:\n\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (produced in step ii) is problematic without protection of the amino group.\n*   **Option B:** Bromination followed by nitration would lead to a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the desired meta relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reducing a nitro group and then removing the resulting amino group (steps i-iv) would just convert benzene back to benzene, making the sequence nonsensical.\n\nTherefore, the sequence starting with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the most viable route.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other, presents a challenge. A straightforward approach where substituents are added one by one is often complicated by conflicting directing effects or severe deactivation of the ring.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes:\n\n1.  **Initial Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This is a good first step as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which can help establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This reaction introduces the acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Introduction of the Second and Third Groups:** Now, a nitro group and a bromo group must be added to the acetophenone ring at the 3 and 5 positions. We can consider two possibilities for the second step: nitration or bromination.\n\n    *   **Path A: Nitration followed by Bromination**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 5. The nitro group also directs the incoming bromine to position 5 (which is *meta* to its own position). Since both groups direct the substitution to the same carbon, this step should proceed with high regioselectivity to yield the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two groups, the reinforcing directing effects make this a viable pathway for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n    *   **Path B: Bromination followed by Nitration**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromo group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has an acetyl group (meta-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (*ortho, para*-director) at position 3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Because the directing effects are not reinforcing, a mixture of products could potentially form, making this route less efficient for a high-yield synthesis compared to Path A.\n\n### Conclusion based on Chemical Principles:\nThe most logical and high-yield direct synthesis involves:\n1.  Friedel-Crafts Acylation of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  Nitration of acetophenone to form 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  Bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone to form the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the provided options. The options are complex and include reduction and diazotization steps, which are often used to overcome directing group conflicts or to introduce groups that cannot be added directly. However, upon detailed analysis:\n*   Options A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical (like creating and then immediately removing a functional group to return to the starting material) or chemically impossible (like performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or aniline under acidic conditions).\n*   Option B begins with the sequence: **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4**. This corresponds to the less efficient \"Path B\" discussed above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem to describe a different, unrelated synthesis that would ultimately fail to produce the target molecule.\n\nThere appears to be a significant flaw in the construction of the options provided. However, if forced to choose the *best* starting sequence that could theoretically lead to the product, the initial steps are the most critical. The sequence of acylation, followed by two successive electrophilic aromatic substitutions, is the correct strategy. The sequence in Path A (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is superior in terms of regioselectivity. None of the options list this exact sequence. The sequence in Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) is plausible, although potentially lower-yielding. This sequence matches the beginning of option B. Given the flaws in the other options, option B presents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, starting point.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the intended sequence was Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination. Or, that despite the conflicting directing effects, the sequence Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration is considered viable. The additional steps (iv-vii) in option B are extraneous and incorrect for the synthesis of the target compound. Based on the initial plausible steps, B is the only choice that starts correctly with a Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n\n**Evaluation of the Proposed Sequences:**\n\n*   **Option A and C:** These sequences begin with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Aniline's amino group (-NH2) is a strong *ortho, para*-director. Subsequent reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation (which fails on anilines without protection) or bromination, would not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would predominantly yield *p*-bromonitrobenzene, which does not have the necessary *meta* relationship between the substituents. This makes option B an unviable route.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to produce acetophenone.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (position 3), which is consistent with the target molecule's structure.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, the benzene ring has an acetyl group at position 1 and a bromo group at position 3. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director (directing to position 5), and the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to positions 5 and 1). Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to the selective formation of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and effective pathway among the choices to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern. While Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally difficult on deactivated rings, this sequence introduces the deactivating groups in an order that maintains sufficient reactivity for each subsequent step while ensuring the correct regiochemistry. The additional steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is successfully synthesized in the first three steps. Their inclusion appears to be a distractor, as the initial three-step sequence is chemically sound and directly produces the target compound with high regioselectivity, which implies a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed the previous analysis was correct.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. All substituents are meta to each other.\n\nA straightforward approach would be a sequence of three electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Let's analyze the directing effects of the groups:\n*   -COCH3 (acetyl): deactivating, meta-director.\n*   -Br (bromo): deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n*   -NO2 (nitro): deactivating, meta-director.\n\nLet's propose a simple synthesis path:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with `CH3COCl/AlCl3` to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated with `HNO3/H2SO4`. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-nitroacetophenone is brominated with `Br2/FeBr3`. In this molecule, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position.\n\nThis sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) should produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one with high regioselectivity.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this simple three-step synthesis. The options include steps like reduction of a nitro group (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`), suggesting a more complex route is intended, likely to circumvent a low-yield step in the simple path. The potential low-yield step in my proposed synthesis is the final bromination, as the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2), which would require harsh conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options to see if they present a viable, high-yield alternative.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed simple path (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is chemically sound in terms of regioselectivity, but the final bromination on a heavily deactivated ring is a valid concern for achieving high yield. The complex reaction sequences in the options suggest this is the problem to be solved. Let's critically evaluate each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Acetophenone) → `ii) Br2/FeBr3` (3-bromoacetophenone) → `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. In step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects of the -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) groups are in conflict. The -COCH3 group directs to position 5, while the -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This would lead to a mixture of products and thus a low yield of the desired isomer, making this path inefficient. The subsequent steps make no sense in the context of creating the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3` (Bromobenzene) → `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`. The nitration of bromobenzene yields primarily the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) and some ortho isomer. The desired meta relationship is not achieved. Furthermore, step `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts acylation) would fail or have a very low yield on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring. This path is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) NaNO2/HCl` (Diazonium salt) → `iv) H3PO2` (Benzene). This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, achieving nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3`... This sequence is problematic from step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) cannot be performed on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring entirely. If this step is a typo for the protection of the amine to form acetanilide, the subsequent steps (as analyzed in the thought process) lead to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, not the final target which also needs an acetyl group.\n\nAll provided options appear to be flawed based on standard organic chemistry principles. There might be a typo in the question or the options. The most logical and regioselective synthesis is the simple three-step pathway I initially proposed: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Despite the potential for a slow final step, it is the only one that directs all substituents to the correct positions without ambiguity. If forced to choose the \"best\" sequence of reactions that *should* be listed, it is this three-step route. Since none of the options reflect this or any other valid complex pathway, there is an error in the question's premise.\n\nHowever, if we must assume there is a correct answer among the choices and re-evaluate, we must reconsider the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone (Option A, step iii). While the directing groups are conflicting, it's possible that the deactivating -COCH3 group's meta-directing effect to position 5 is dominant enough to provide a reasonable yield, making it the \"least wrong\" option among a set of flawed choices. But the subsequent steps in A (reduction, nitration again) are nonsensical.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, a definitive answer cannot be reached. The question or options are likely incorrect. The most chemically sound synthesis is not listed.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option A and the reaction sequence is only the first three steps.\ni) `CH3COCl/AlCl3` ; ii) `Br2/FeBr3` ; iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`\nThis would produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, but as discussed, step ii -> iii has conflicting directors.\n\nLet's reconsider the simple path: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1. Benzene -> Acetophenone\n2. Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3. 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\nThis path is the most logical. Let's re-examine the options to see if any can be interpreted as this path. None can.\n\nLet's step back and reconsider the initial bromination and nitration order.\nPath: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation\n1. Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2. Nitrobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene\n3. 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nThis path has perfect regioselectivity. The only issue is the final Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated ring. This is often cited as a major limitation.\n\nComparing the two most plausible routes:\nRoute 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination (final step is slow)\nRoute 2: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation (final step is slow/fails)\n\nBetween the two, bromination on a ring with two deactivating groups (Route 1) is generally considered more feasible than Friedel-Crafts acylation on a similarly deactivated ring (Route 2). Therefore, the sequence Acylation → Nitration → Bromination is the superior theoretical pathway. Since this is not an option, and all given options contain significant chemical errors, a correct answer cannot be determined from the choices.\n\nFinal decision based on re-evaluation: All options are critically flawed. There is no correct sequence among the choices. The problem is ill-posed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario where a \"best\" fit must be found, it's impossible to logically justify any of the given sequences.\n\n<<<No correct option can be determined from the provided choices as they all contain significant chemical errors or nonsensical steps.>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Substituents:** It has three groups attached to the benzene ring:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Positions:** The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct the position of incoming groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Synthetic Strategies\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be carefully planned. The most effective strategies involve installing a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Acylation.** This is the most logical first step.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination of Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the C3 position.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** At this stage, the ring has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful deactivating effect of the acetyl group makes the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) less reactive. The acetyl group strongly directs the incoming nitro group to the other *meta* position (C5). Therefore, nitration preferentially occurs at C5, yielding the desired product.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration or Bromination.**\n    *   If the first step is bromination, an *ortho, para*-director is installed. The subsequent nitration would yield primarily the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene isomer, which is incorrect.\n    *   If the first step is nitration, a strongly deactivating nitro group is installed. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) would fail because these reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n### 4. Conclusion on the Correct Sequence\n\nThe only chemically viable pathway among the fundamental options is to perform the reactions in the following order:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n2.  **Bromination**\n3.  **Nitration**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option D as described by a majority of the provided analyses. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically impossible steps (e.g., Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline or nitrobenzene) or follow a synthetic route that would produce the wrong isomers. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be distractors, as the target molecule is successfully formed after the first three steps.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option D is the only one that provides a chemically sound route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The sequence correctly installs a meta-directing acetyl group first, followed by bromination and nitration. Both subsequent substitutions are directed to the correct meta positions, leading to the desired 1,3,5-trisubstituted product in high yield. The initial steps of this option successfully create the target molecule.\n\nThe analysis concludes that option D is the only chemically sound pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful sequence of reactions is required to ensure the substituents are placed at the correct positions (1, 3, and 5). This involves considering the directing effects of each group added to the benzene ring. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) all in a meta relationship to each other.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the most effective synthesis strategy, which aligns with the steps presented in one of the options:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring. This is achieved by reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director and deactivates the ring for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n\n2.  **Bromination:** The second step is the bromination of acetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, it will direct the incoming bromine atom to the meta (position 3) position. This reaction is carried out using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst such as iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** The final step is to introduce the nitro group. At this stage, the benzene ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 (meta-director) and a bromine atom at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   When directing effects are in conflict, the position that is least sterically hindered and electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both existing groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group strongly directs meta to itself, and the bromo group directs ortho/para. Position 5 is ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group. More importantly, in a 1,3-disubstituted ring, substitution at the 5-position is strongly favored as both groups direct the incoming electrophile to this position. This reaction, using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), yields the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is the most direct and high-yield pathway. However, the options provided are more complex, suggesting a misunderstanding in the premise of the question options. Based on the most chemically sound principles for achieving the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern, a sequence starting with acylation, followed by the introduction of the other two groups, is the correct approach. The other options fail because they either perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated ring (which is not feasible), or they follow a sequence of directing effects that would not lead to the 1,3,5-product.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options based on this correct three-step synthesis: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. This sequence is a truncated version of option D. The additional steps in option D (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) are nonsensical and incorrect in that order. However, since the initial three steps of option D are the only chemically logical start to forming a 1,3,5-substituted acetophenone derivative, it is the most plausible choice despite its flawed later steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Re-evaluating the Options Based on Chemical Principles\n\nMy initial logical deduction led to a simple three-step synthesis: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**\n2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone** (Acetyl is a meta-director).\n3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Both acetyl and nitro are meta-directors, reinforcing the substitution at position 5).\n\nThis pathway is chemically sound. However, it is not listed as an option. The options provided are more complex, suggesting that this direct route may have issues, such as low yield in the final bromination step due to the ring being strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions also fail on strongly deactivated rings.\n\nLet's meticulously re-examine the provided options, keeping in mind the directing effects of substituents and the possibility of using a functional group as a temporary director before removing it (e.g., via deamination).\n\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option A\n\n**i) Br2/FeBr3:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n**ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Bromobenzene → Mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The bromine is an o,p-director. This step does not produce the required meta-substituted precursor in high yield.\n**Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect as it fails to establish the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern from the beginning.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\n**i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n**ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n**iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Aniline's lone pair reacts with the Lewis acid (AlCl3), deactivating the ring so strongly that Friedel-Crafts acylation does not occur. Instead, N-acylation would happen. Assuming the intended reaction was N-acylation to form acetanilide, the -NHCOCH3 group is an o,p-director.\n**iv) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetanilide → 4-Bromoacetanilide (major product).\nThis pathway leads to para-substitution, which is inconsistent with the target molecule's 1,3,5-pattern.\n**Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option D\n\n**i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n**ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n**iii) NaNO2/HCl:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n**iv) H3PO2:** Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene. This sequence just reduces the nitro group and then removes it, returning to the starting material.\n**Conclusion:** Option D is nonsensical.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Option C\n\nThis option is the only remaining possibility and must be the correct one. Let's trace the steps carefully to understand the synthetic strategy.\n\n**i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n*   This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n\n**ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n*   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position.\n\n**iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → **1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   This is the most complex step to analyze. The ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (o,p-director) at C3.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n*   In cases of conflicting directing effects, the outcome depends on the relative activating/deactivating strength and steric factors. Both groups are deactivating. The -COCH3 group is a stronger deactivator than -Br. Often, the directing effect of existing groups will lead to a mixture of products. However, in this specific case, the nitration is known to proceed to the C5 position. The position is meta to the strongest deactivating group (-COCH3) and ortho to the weaker deactivating group (-Br). This gives the desired product. The subsequent steps in the option (iv, v, vi, vii) seem superfluous if this step directly yields the final product.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of the question or the options provided. Let's reconsider the possibility that the sequence in Option C is designed to overcome a low-yield or difficult reaction. What if step (iii) is not nitration but another reaction, or if the sequence is different?\n\nLet's re-read the question and options. It's possible there's a typo in the option and it's meant to be a different sequence. However, assuming the option is written as intended, there is a significant logical inconsistency. The sequence `iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2` appears to be a jumble of reactions that don't logically follow to create the target molecule from 3-bromoacetophenone. For instance, reducing a nitro group that hasn't been added yet (Fe/HCl) makes no sense.\n\nLet's ignore the nonsensical tail end of option C (steps iv-vii) and focus on the initial, logical steps.\n*   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n*   **Step 2: Bromination.** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is chemically viable. It is possible that Option C is the intended answer, despite the confusing and incorrect additional steps listed. The core of the correct synthesis is likely embedded in the beginning of this option.\n\nLet's try the other order of bromination and nitration:\n*   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n*   **Step 2: Nitration.** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n*   **Step 3: Bromination.** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   In this case, both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are strong meta-directors. They work together to direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This is a very clean reaction with reinforcing directing effects, likely leading to a higher yield than the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\nSince this superior sequence (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not an option, we must choose the best among the given choices. Options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed from the early steps. Option C contains the correct starting sequence (Acylation -> Bromination) which can, in principle, lead to the desired substitution pattern, even if it's not the highest-yield method and even if the subsequent steps listed are incorrect. Given the format of the question, it is most probable that the intended answer is the one that contains the most plausible synthetic route, despite any errors. The first three steps of C represent a plausible, if not optimal, synthesis.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Wrong regiochemistry from step ii.\n*   B: Wrong reaction at step iii (F-C fails) and wrong regiochemistry.\n*   D: Nonsensical sequence (deamination back to benzene).\n*   C: Steps i and ii are correct for building a 1,3-disubstituted precursor. Step iii (nitration) is plausible, although it might give mixtures. The remaining steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as written. However, compared to the other options, C is the only one that begins with a logical sequence toward the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2), all in a meta relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the options and the chemical principles involved:\n\n*   **Substituent Effects:** In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the order in which substituents are added is crucial.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the nitro group (-NO2) are electron-withdrawing and are **meta-directors**.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br) is deactivating but is an **ortho-, para-director**.\n    *   Friedel-Crafts reactions, such as acylation (adding the -COCH3 group), fail on strongly deactivated rings, like those bearing a nitro group, or on rings with an amino group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n        This sequence begins with bromination, followed by nitration. The third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, is attempted on a bromo-nitro-benzene ring. The presence of the deactivating nitro group makes this step non-viable.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n        This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline (-NH2). The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n    *   **Option D:** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the group). This would return the molecule to benzene, which is not a productive synthesis route.\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n        1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is a standard and effective first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n        2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a logical step.\n        3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho-, para-director (-Br). These groups have conflicting directing effects, which would typically lead to a mixture of products, thus not providing a \"high-yield\" of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one isomer.\n\n*   **Optimal Synthesis vs. Provided Options:**\n    The most efficient, high-yield synthesis would involve an order of reactions where the directing effects of the substituents are cooperative. This would be:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The -COCH3 group directs meta).\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are meta-directors and they cooperatively direct the bromine to the 5-position).\n\n    This optimal sequence is not listed as an option. However, when evaluating the given choices, options A, C, and D contain steps that are known to fail. Option B is the only sequence where the initial steps are chemically viable and lead towards the target molecule, even if the yield in the third step is compromised by competing directing effects. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) in the option are nonsensical for producing the final target and appear to be erroneous. By elimination of the unfeasible options, B remains the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the relationship between the substituents. The acetyl group is at position 1. The bromo group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group). The nitro group is at position 5 (also meta to the acetyl group). The bromo and nitro groups are meta to each other. This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is crucial, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Correct reduction of a nitro group.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-). This complex is very strongly deactivating, preventing the acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Correct bromination.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration. The -Br group is an o,p-director, giving a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\n*   **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2).

The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group. This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a strong meta-director (-COCH3 at position 1) and a weak o,p-director (-Br at position 3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group dominates, directing the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (position 5). This gives the desired target molecule. This is a known and effective transformation.\n*   **Steps iv) - vii):** These steps are performed on the final product. They involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence is nonsensical for the synthesis of the target molecule and appears to be included as a distractor. The synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a chemically sound and high-yield route to the target molecule in its first three steps. The other options contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or are logically flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine the optimal reaction sequence.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone.\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5, meaning all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nTo achieve a high yield, the substituents should be introduced in an order that utilizes their directing effects advantageously. The presence of three substituents all *meta* to each other suggests that the synthesis should prioritize the use of *meta*-directing groups to control the substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate the two most plausible synthetic routes:\n\n**Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. This correctly places the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director, on the ring.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the 3-position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone is brominated using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr3). Now, the ring has two *meta*-directing groups (acetyl at C1, nitro at C3). Both groups direct the incoming bromine to the 5-position. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to a high yield of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration (as suggested by the start of Option C)**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone is nitrated. In this case, the directing effects of the existing substituents are in conflict. The acetyl group (at C1) directs *meta* (to C5), while the bromo group (at C3) directs *ortho* and *para* (to C2, C4, and C6). While the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, will be one of the products, other isomers will also be formed, leading to a lower yield compared to Route 1.\n\n**Evaluation of the Given Options:**\n\n*   **Option A and D:** These options begin with nitration. The subsequent step in both is a Friedel-Crafts reaction (or preparation for one) on a highly deactivated nitrobenzene or aniline ring. Friedel-Crafts reactions are known to fail on rings with strongly deactivating groups like -NO2 or on amines. Therefore, these options are not viable.\n*   **Option B:** This option begins with bromination, followed by nitration, which produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the required meta arrangement. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation on the deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would also be unsuccessful.\n*   **Option C:** This option begins with the sequence: i) Acylation, ii) Bromination, iii) Nitration. As analyzed in Route 2, the first three steps of this sequence do produce the target molecule, although perhaps not with the highest possible yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically illogical for this synthesis and appear to be erroneous. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental flaws preventing the synthesis, the initial part of Option C represents a valid, albeit suboptimal, pathway.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most efficient, high-yield synthesis follows the sequence: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. This exact sequence is not presented as a complete option. However, Option C starts with a plausible, if less efficient, sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) that does lead to the desired product. The other options are fundamentally flawed. Therefore, Option C is the only choice that contains a correct synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\nThis molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern (1,3,5) is crucial for determining the correct synthetic route.\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group (by induction) but an *ortho, para*-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating, making the Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring fail. The primary reaction would be N-acylation. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.\niv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply converts benzene back to benzene, making the first four steps pointless. The synthesis then restarts from benzene.\nv) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nvi) Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is an *o,p*-director and para is sterically favored).\nvii) 4-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring has a -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and a -COCH3 at C4 (m-director). The -Br directs to C2 and C6. The -COCH3 directs to C3 and C5. The directing effects do not align to produce the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The major product would be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the target molecule.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\niii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2), and Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is correct.\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring now has a -COCH3 group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a -Br group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) much less reactive towards electrophilic attack. The least deactivated position is C5 (meta to the acetyl group). Therefore, nitration will preferentially occur at C5.\n    *   This reaction yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the desired target molecule.\n\nThe synthesis is successfully completed in these first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv to vii) are superfluous for synthesizing the target molecule and are likely an error in the question's formulation. However, since the initial part of sequence C provides a valid and high-yield route to the desired product, and all other options contain fatal flaws, option C is the correct choice.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Start with benzene.\n2.  Introduce a *meta*-director: Acylation to get acetophenone.\n3.  Introduce a second substituent *meta* to the first: Bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n4.  Introduce the third substituent: Nitration. The combined directing effects lead to substitution at C5, resulting in the 1,3,5 pattern. This is a logical and effective synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, we need to add the groups in a specific order. A key principle for synthesizing polysubstituted benzenes is to consider the directing effects at each step.\n\nA powerful strategy for obtaining 1,3,5-trisubstituted products where at least two groups are *meta*-directors is to install a *meta*-director first, followed by another, and then a third. The two *meta*-directing groups will reinforce each other, directing the third substituent to the position *meta* to both.\n\nLet's evaluate this strategy:\n*   **Path A: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → m-Nitroacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position (C3). Now we have two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    3.  **m-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. This is a reinforcing effect, leading to high regioselectivity for the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated, this pathway is highly selective and is a standard method for this synthesis.\n\n*   **Path B: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → m-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming Br+ to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **m-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ???**: Now we have a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br at C3). Their directing effects are in conflict. The -COCH3 group directs to C5, while the -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. This will lead to a mixture of products (mainly 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone), making it a low-yield synthesis for the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer.\n\nFrom this analysis, Path A is superior for a high-yield synthesis. However, this exact 3-step sequence is not listed as an option. The options are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex route, possibly involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed (indicated by the Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2 sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the provided multi-step options.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) Nitration, ii) Reduction, iii) Diazotization, iv) Deamination. This sequence (HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO2/HCl -> H3PO2) converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to the benzenediazonium ion, and finally back to benzene. This is a futile sequence. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Bromination, ii) Nitration. This produces p-bromonitrobenzene as the major product. Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. It then attempts a series of substitutions on the aniline ring before a final deamination. Detailed analysis of the directing effects at each stage shows that this path is very unlikely to produce the target isomer. For instance, after forming 3-bromo-5-aminoacetophenone (assuming this intermediate is formed), the subsequent nitration would not selectively occur at the desired position to form the precursor for the final product.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    The first three steps correspond to Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration). As discussed, step (iii) of this sequence is not highly selective and would result in a low yield of the desired isomer. However, compared to the other options, this sequence at least starts by installing the substituents in a way that *could* lead to the product, even if inefficiently. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and deamination seem misplaced and nonsensical if the product were already formed in step (iii). For example, applying steps (iv)-(vii) to the major product of step (iii) (3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone) does not lead to the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question's options, as none describe a clean, high-yield synthesis. The best and most direct synthesis is the 3-step \"Path A\" (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination).\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option among the given choices:\n*   Options B and D are fundamentally flawed and cannot work.\n*   Option A leads to incorrect isomers based on directing effects.\n*   Option C outlines a possible, albeit low-yield, synthesis in its first three steps (Path B). The remaining steps are nonsensical in this context. It is the most plausible starting sequence among the choices, as it correctly establishes a 1,3-relationship between two of the groups. It's possible the question assumes the problematic nitration step (iii) works with acceptable yield, making C the intended answer despite the superfluous later steps.\n\nGiven the elimination of other options, Option C is the most likely intended answer, representing the Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration route, despite its chemical drawbacks and the confusing additional steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nI have analyzed the reaction sequences and confirmed the key step in option D.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target:** The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). They are in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): Deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option D:**\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly adds the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is a bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta-position (C3). This step is correct.\n    *   **iii) 3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is a nitration. We have two groups on the ring: acetyl at C1 (meta-director) and bromo at C3 (ortho/para-director).\n        *   The acetyl group directs the nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   As confirmed by the provided information and chemical principles, the directing effect of the acetyl group to the C5 position prevails, leading to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. This step correctly forms the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze Other Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with bromination (o,p-director), so the next substitution (nitration) would primarily give the 1,4-product, not the 1,3-product needed.\n    *   **B)** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, and then deamination. This sequence (i-iv) just converts benzene back to benzene, which is illogical.\n    *   **C)** Starts with nitration and reduction to form aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails on the highly activated (and basic) aniline ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions in option D (steps i, ii, and iii) is the only one that correctly synthesizes the target molecule with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and incorrect, but the initial, crucial part of the synthesis is correct only in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a careful sequence of reactions to ensure the correct placement of the three substituents on the benzene ring. The key is to consider the directing effects of each group as it is added. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nA logical and high-yield synthesis route is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation of Benzene:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring using acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is crucial for placing the next substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n\n2.  **Bromination of Acetophenone:** The next step is the bromination of acetophenone using bromine (Br2) and a catalyst like iron(III) bromide (FeBr3). Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom will be added to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n\n3.  **Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Now, we have two directing groups on the ring: the acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-directing) and the bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-directing).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In this case of competing directors, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups is the most deactivated. However, the positions that are *meta* to the acetyl group (C5) and *ortho/para* to the bromo group (C2, C4, C6) must be considered. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group and also *meta* to the bromo group. The position C4 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *para* to the bromo group. The position C2 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group. While complex, the synthesis proceeds to place the nitro group at the C5 position, yielding the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This specific substitution pattern is known and the compound is commercially available.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The additional steps in option C (iv, v, vi, vii) involve reduction of a nitro group, another nitration, and then diazotization and removal of a group, which are unnecessarily complex and incorrect for synthesizing the target molecule which retains a nitro group. However, among the choices provided, the initial sequence of option C is the only chemically sound pathway to begin the synthesis. The question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the initial steps of C are the correct ones. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their initial steps:\n\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (produced in step ii) is problematic without protection of the amino group.\n*   **Option B:** Bromination followed by nitration would lead to a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the desired meta relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reducing a nitro group and then removing the resulting amino group (steps i-iv) would just convert benzene back to benzene, making the sequence nonsensical.\n\nTherefore, the sequence starting with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the most viable route.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other, presents a challenge. A straightforward approach where substituents are added one by one is often complicated by conflicting directing effects or severe deactivation of the ring.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes:\n\n1.  **Initial Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This is a good first step as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which can help establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This reaction introduces the acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Introduction of the Second and Third Groups:** Now, a nitro group and a bromo group must be added to the acetophenone ring at the 3 and 5 positions. We can consider two possibilities for the second step: nitration or bromination.\n\n    *   **Path A: Nitration followed by Bromination**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 5. The nitro group also directs the incoming bromine to position 5 (which is *meta* to its own position). Since both groups direct the substitution to the same carbon, this step should proceed with high regioselectivity to yield the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two groups, the reinforcing directing effects make this a viable pathway for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n    *   **Path B: Bromination followed by Nitration**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromo group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has an acetyl group (meta-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (*ortho, para*-director) at position 3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Because the directing effects are not reinforcing, a mixture of products could potentially form, making this route less efficient for a high-yield synthesis compared to Path A.\n\n### Conclusion based on Chemical Principles:\nThe most logical and high-yield direct synthesis involves:\n1.  Friedel-Crafts Acylation of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  Nitration of acetophenone to form 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  Bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone to form the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the provided options. The options are complex and include reduction and diazotization steps, which are often used to overcome directing group conflicts or to introduce groups that cannot be added directly. However, upon detailed analysis:\n*   Options A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical (like creating and then immediately removing a functional group to return to the starting material) or chemically impossible (like performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or aniline under acidic conditions).\n*   Option B begins with the sequence: **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4**. This corresponds to the less efficient \"Path B\" discussed above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem to describe a different, unrelated synthesis that would ultimately fail to produce the target molecule.\n\nThere appears to be a significant flaw in the construction of the options provided. However, if forced to choose the *best* starting sequence that could theoretically lead to the product, the initial steps are the most critical. The sequence of acylation, followed by two successive electrophilic aromatic substitutions, is the correct strategy. The sequence in Path A (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is superior in terms of regioselectivity. None of the options list this exact sequence. The sequence in Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) is plausible, although potentially lower-yielding. This sequence matches the beginning of option B. Given the flaws in the other options, option B presents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, starting point.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the intended sequence was Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination. Or, that despite the conflicting directing effects, the sequence Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration is considered viable. The additional steps (iv-vii) in option B are extraneous and incorrect for the synthesis of the target compound. Based on the initial plausible steps, B is the only choice that starts correctly with a Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n\n**Evaluation of the Proposed Sequences:**\n\n*   **Option A and C:** These sequences begin with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Aniline's amino group (-NH2) is a strong *ortho, para*-director. Subsequent reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation (which fails on anilines without protection) or bromination, would not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would predominantly yield *p*-bromonitrobenzene, which does not have the necessary *meta* relationship between the substituents. This makes option B an unviable route.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to produce acetophenone.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (position 3), which is consistent with the target molecule's structure.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, the benzene ring has an acetyl group at position 1 and a bromo group at position 3. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director (directing to position 5), and the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to positions 5 and 1). Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to the selective formation of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and effective pathway among the choices to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern. While Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally difficult on deactivated rings, this sequence introduces the deactivating groups in an order that maintains sufficient reactivity for each subsequent step while ensuring the correct regiochemistry. The additional steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is successfully synthesized in the first three steps. Their inclusion appears to be a distractor, as the initial three-step sequence is chemically sound and directly produces the target compound with high regioselectivity, which implies a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed the previous analysis was correct.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. All substituents are meta to each other.\n\nA straightforward approach would be a sequence of three electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Let's analyze the directing effects of the groups:\n*   -COCH3 (acetyl): deactivating, meta-director.\n*   -Br (bromo): deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n*   -NO2 (nitro): deactivating, meta-director.\n\nLet's propose a simple synthesis path:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with `CH3COCl/AlCl3` to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated with `HNO3/H2SO4`. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-nitroacetophenone is brominated with `Br2/FeBr3`. In this molecule, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position.\n\nThis sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) should produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one with high regioselectivity.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this simple three-step synthesis. The options include steps like reduction of a nitro group (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), and deamination (`H3PO2`), suggesting a more complex route is intended, likely to circumvent a low-yield step in the simple path. The potential low-yield step in my proposed synthesis is the final bromination, as the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2), which would require harsh conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options to see if they present a viable, high-yield alternative.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed simple path (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is chemically sound in terms of regioselectivity, but the final bromination on a heavily deactivated ring is a valid concern for achieving high yield. The complex reaction sequences in the options suggest this is the problem to be solved. Let's critically evaluate each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Acetophenone) → `ii) Br2/FeBr3` (3-bromoacetophenone) → `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. In step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects of the -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) groups are in conflict. The -COCH3 group directs to position 5, while the -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This would lead to a mixture of products and thus a low yield of the desired isomer, making this path inefficient. The subsequent steps make no sense in the context of creating the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3` (Bromobenzene) → `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`. The nitration of bromobenzene yields primarily the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) and some ortho isomer. The desired meta relationship is not achieved. Furthermore, step `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts acylation) would fail or have a very low yield on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring. This path is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) NaNO2/HCl` (Diazonium salt) → `iv) H3PO2` (Benzene). This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, achieving nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitrobenzene) → `ii) Fe/HCl` (Aniline) → `iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3`... This sequence is problematic from step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) cannot be performed on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring entirely. If this step is a typo for the protection of the amine to form acetanilide, the subsequent steps (as analyzed in the thought process) lead to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, not the final target which also needs an acetyl group.\n\nAll provided options appear to be flawed based on standard organic chemistry principles. There might be a typo in the question or the options. The most logical and regioselective synthesis is the simple three-step pathway I initially proposed: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Despite the potential for a slow final step, it is the only one that directs all substituents to the correct positions without ambiguity. If forced to choose the \"best\" sequence of reactions that *should* be listed, it is this three-step route. Since none of the options reflect this or any other valid complex pathway, there is an error in the question's premise.\n\nHowever, if we must assume there is a correct answer among the choices and re-evaluate, we must reconsider the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone (Option A, step iii). While the directing groups are conflicting, it's possible that the deactivating -COCH3 group's meta-directing effect to position 5 is dominant enough to provide a reasonable yield, making it the \"least wrong\" option among a set of flawed choices. But the subsequent steps in A (reduction, nitration again) are nonsensical.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, a definitive answer cannot be reached. The question or options are likely incorrect. The most chemically sound synthesis is not listed.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option A and the reaction sequence is only the first three steps.\ni) `CH3COCl/AlCl3` ; ii) `Br2/FeBr3` ; iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`\nThis would produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, but as discussed, step ii -> iii has conflicting directors.\n\nLet's reconsider the simple path: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n1. Benzene -> Acetophenone\n2. Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3. 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\nThis path is the most logical. Let's re-examine the options to see if any can be interpreted as this path. None can.\n\nLet's step back and reconsider the initial bromination and nitration order.\nPath: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation\n1. Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2. Nitrobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene\n3. 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nThis path has perfect regioselectivity. The only issue is the final Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated ring. This is often cited as a major limitation.\n\nComparing the two most plausible routes:\nRoute 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination (final step is slow)\nRoute 2: Nitration -> Bromination -> Acylation (final step is slow/fails)\n\nBetween the two, bromination on a ring with two deactivating groups (Route 1) is generally considered more feasible than Friedel-Crafts acylation on a similarly deactivated ring (Route 2). Therefore, the sequence Acylation → Nitration → Bromination is the superior theoretical pathway. Since this is not an option, and all given options contain significant chemical errors, a correct answer cannot be determined from the choices.\n\nFinal decision based on re-evaluation: All options are critically flawed. There is no correct sequence among the choices. The problem is ill-posed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario where a \"best\" fit must be found, it's impossible to logically justify any of the given sequences.\n\n<<<No correct option can be determined from the provided choices as they all contain significant chemical errors or nonsensical steps.>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
