Using this [H⁺] and the third dissociation constant (Ka₃), it calculated the final orthophosphate concentration, [PO₄³⁻].\n4.  **Hypothesis Pruning:** The calculated [PO₄³⁻] was 6.236x10⁻⁷ M. This result was compared to the initial hypotheses, and it most closely matched option C (6.24x10⁻⁷ M). Therefore, options A, B, and D were pruned.\n\nThe final choice selected by the script is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe search results confirm the methodology used. The solution is a phosphate buffer containing the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. The pH of this buffer is governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.

The logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the resulting hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), the weak acid in the primary buffer system.\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), the conjugate base.\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer formed by the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate for the H2PO4-/HPO42- system as the pKa values are well-separated. The process involves:\n1.  Calculating the molar concentrations of the acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO42-).\n2.  Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the appropriate pKa (pKa2) to find the pH, or using the Ka2 expression directly to find [H+].\n3.  Using the calculated [H+] and the Ka expression for the next dissociation step (Ka3) to find the concentration of the desired species (PO43-).\n\nThe initial calculations were:\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\nUsing the equilibrium for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻] = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * [H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nNow, we use the equilibrium for the third dissociation, which involves the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻):\nHPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻] = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4³⁻]:\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\nLet's re-calculate with higher precision to be sure.\n*   [H2PO4-] = (1.00 / 136.09) / 0.200 = 0.0367404 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = (1.00 / 177.99) / 0.200 = 0.0280915 M\n*   [H+] = (6.2e-8) * (0.0367404 / 0.0280915) = 8.10887e-8 M\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.0280915) / (8.10887e-8) = 6.2356e-7 M\n\nThe calculated concentration is 6.2356x10⁻⁷ M.\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of the initial constants (Mw, Ka) in the problem statement. The methodology is sound and the calculation is confirmed.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic.\n1.  The solution is a buffer made of a conjugate acid-base pair: H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n2.  The pH of this buffer is primarily determined by the pKa₂ of phosphoric acid.\n3.  The concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka₃), which is dependent on the pH (or [H⁺]) set by the buffer.\n4.  The calculation proceeds in two steps: first find [H⁺] from the buffer equilibrium, then use [H⁺] to find [PO₄³⁻] from the third dissociation equilibrium. This is a standard and correct approach.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The answer is B.\n\nTo prepare the final response, I will outline the steps clearly.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles:** Determine the number of moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n2.  **Calculate concentrations:** Convert moles to molar concentrations using the given volume. These are the initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n3.  **Calculate [H⁺]:** Use the Ka₂ expression for the equilibrium H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ to find the hydrogen ion concentration.\n4.  **Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:** Use the Ka₃ expression for the equilibrium HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ and the previously calculated [H⁺] to find the orthophosphate concentration.\n5.  **Compare:** Match the calculated value to the closest option.\n\nThis detailed plan confirms the initial quick calculation.

The hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**: The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated concentration is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Molar Mass**: It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified.\n*   **Correct Equilibria**: The problem requires a two-step equilibrium calculation. The [H⁺] must first be determined from the primary buffer system (governed by Ka₂) before it can be used to find the concentration of a minor species ([PO₄³⁻]) from a subsequent equilibrium (governed by Ka₃).\n*   **Approximation Validity**: The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components equal their equilibrium concentrations is valid because they are part of a buffer and their concentrations are much larger than the Ka values.\n*   **Matching Result to Option**: The most common error among the candidate answers was correctly calculating the value (~6.24x10⁻⁷ M) but then incorrectly assigning it to option B, C, or D. The calculated value corresponds directly to option A.\n\nThe correct calculation yields a result of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate for the H2PO4-/HPO42- system as the pKa values are well-separated. The process involves:\n1.

This means Ka₂ is used to find the system's [H⁺].\n*   **Identifying the Target Equilibrium:** The question asks for [PO₄³⁻], which is a product of the third dissociation step, governed by Ka₃.\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid because they are part of a buffer and their concentrations are much larger than the Ka values. Similarly, the change in [HPO₄²⁻] due to the third dissociation is negligible because Ka₃ is very small.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n**1.

This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, with Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium is:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\n    The expression for Ka₃ is:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the orthophosphate concentration, [PO₄³⁻], using the [H⁺] and [HPO₄²⁻] values we've already determined.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] = 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer system composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻).
