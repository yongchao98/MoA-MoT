Hypotheses A, B, and C were pruned due to chemically invalid or highly inefficient steps that would not lead to the desired product.\n\n-   **Option A** was eliminated for its nonsensical reaction order, attempting a diazotization reaction on a sulfonic acid.\n-   **Option B** was eliminated because the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline would lead to a meta-substituted product, which is an incorrect pathway for the target 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n-   **Option C** was eliminated for proposing a non-standard and unpredictable reaction of a diazonium salt with nitrating acid.\n\n**Option D** emerged as the only chemically plausible sequence. The analysis traced the steps:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration:** Nitration yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the minor ortho product, which is a significant drawback for a \"high-yield\" synthesis but necessary for the final structure.\n3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n4.  **Second Nitration:** The resulting o-tert-butylaniline is nitrated again. Directing group effects make the desired product plausible, though not guaranteed as the sole major product.\n5.  **Diazotization:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol.\n7.  **Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the target ethoxy ether.\n\nAlthough this route has steps with poor regioselectivity (steps ii and iv), it is the only sequence of reactions among the choices that can logically form the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The final two steps (viii and ix) are redundant.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAfter a thorough analysis of the reaction sequences and the directing effects of the substituents, it is clear that synthesizing the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, in high yield is a complex task where the regioselectivity of the electrophilic aromatic substitution steps is critical.\n\nLet's break down the required substitution pattern:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe key challenges are the adjacent, bulky tert-butyl and ethoxy groups, and the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is difficult to achieve with standard directing group effects.\n\nA careful evaluation of the provided options reveals significant chemical flaws in options A, B, and C, such as attempting to perform a diazotization without an amine (Option A), nitrating a diazonium salt (Option B), or performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on an unprotected aniline (Option C). These represent chemically unsound steps.\n\nOption D presents a sequence of chemically plausible reactions, but as analyzed, it leads to an isomer of the target molecule, specifically **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, depending on the conditions for the nitration of the aniline intermediate. The final two steps in option D (sulfonation followed by desulfonation) are also illogical as they are redundant.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps, and option D, while composed of possible reactions, is illogical and does not lead to the specified product, none of the provided options represent a correct, high-yield synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The question is fundamentally flawed as presented.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, one might select the sequence that avoids chemically impossible reactions, even if it doesn't yield the correct product. In this context, Option D is the only one where each individual transformation is a known chemical reaction. This suggests that Option D is the most likely intended answer, despite its significant flaws in logic and outcome. This choice is made by eliminating the other options as chemically impossible.\n\nA plausible, albeit complex, synthesis that would yield the target molecule involves a blocking group strategy to achieve the correct regiochemistry, followed by a series of functional group transformations. Such a sequence would be:\n1.  **Alkylation** of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation** to install a sulfonic acid group at the para position, blocking it (forms p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid).\n3.  **Nitration**, which is now directed to the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group (forms 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid).\n4.  **Desulfonation** by heating with dilute acid to remove the blocking group, yielding o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n5.  **Reduction** of the nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl) to give o-tert-butylaniline.\n6.  **Nitration** of o-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta) and -tBu (ortho) groups would favor substitution at the C3 and C5 positions. While sterically hindered, reaction at C3 would yield 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.\n7.  **Diazotization** of the amino group using NaNO2/HCl.\n8.  **Hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt by warming in water to replace the N2+ group with an -OH group, forming 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis** with NaOH and ethyl bromide to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding the final product.\n\nThis valid sequence does not match any of the options provided. Therefore, based on the provided choices, there is no correct answer. I am unable to provide an answer in the requested format as all options are incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no correct option among the choices.>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Final Answer Determination\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Structure:**\n*   The molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because the directing effects of the groups often conflict. A high-yield synthesis typically requires a well-thought-out strategy, often involving blocking groups.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Common Steps and Reagents:**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3):** Attaches a tert-butyl group. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the para position.\n*   **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Adds a nitro (-NO2) group, which is a meta-director.\n*   **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** Adds a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group, which is a meta-director. This reaction is reversible and the -SO3H group can be used as a \"blocking group\" to protect a position (usually the para position) and then be removed later with dilute acid and heat.\n*   **Reduction of Nitro Group (Fe/HCl):** Converts -NO2 to an amino (-NH2) group.\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** Converts an amino (-NH2) group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** Replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** Converts a hydroxyl (-OH) group into an ethoxy (-OEt) group.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A:**\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming sulfonyl group to the para position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Now, the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. This is a key step to force ortho-nitration.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amine.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **diazonium salt**. The amine at position 2 is converted to a diazonium group.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Diazonium salt → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid. *Note: The prompt has a potential typo in option A, listing `HNO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4` as separate steps after diazotization. The logical step here is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.*\n7.  **vii) dilute H2SO4 / Heat (Desulfonation):** 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **3-tert-butyl-1-phenol (or m-tert-butylphenol)**. This step removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. *Correction: The order of steps is crucial. Let's re-examine the sequence provided in the options.*\n\nLet's reconsider the order of the final steps based on chemical principles. After step (v), we have the diazonium salt of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   **Path 1:** First, remove the blocking group, then convert the diazonium salt. Desulfonation requires heat and dilute acid, which would also hydrolyze the diazonium salt. So, steps (vi) and (vii) likely happen concurrently. This would yield **3-tert-butyl-6-hydroxyphenol**, which is not the desired intermediate.\n\n*   **Path 2:** First, replace the diazonium salt, then remove the blocking group.\n    *   Step A: Diazonium salt + H2O/Heat → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Step B: 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → **3-tert-butylphenol**. This is not the correct precursor. We need the t-butyl group ortho to the hydroxyl group.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental flaw in the initial steps of Option A if the goal is to have the t-butyl and hydroxyl groups ortho to each other. Let's re-read the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The t-butyl is at C2, ethoxy at C1. They are ortho.\n\nLet's try a different logical construction that leads to the correct isomer arrangement and see if it matches any option.\n\n**A More Plausible Synthetic Route:**\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Phenol → **2-tert-butylphenol** (+ 4-tert-butylphenol). The ortho isomer is needed and can be separated. The -OH group is a powerful ortho, para-director.\n3.  **ii) NaOH/EtBr:** 2-tert-butylphenol → **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene**. Convert the phenol to the ether. The -OEt group is also a strong ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene → **Product mixture**. The -OEt group directs to positions 4 and 6. The t-butyl group directs to position 4. Nitration would predominantly occur at position 4, giving 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-4-nitrobenzene. This does not yield the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining the 1,2,3-substitution pattern suggests that one of the groups must be introduced via a method that circumvents the usual directing rules, or the directing properties of the groups are manipulated during the synthesis. The use of a blocking group is the most common strategy for this.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Option A, assuming there might be a misunderstanding of the reactions.\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene\n*   ii) SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n*   iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n*   iv) Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt\n*   vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → This step is highly unusual. It is not a standard Sandmeyer reaction.\n*   vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → This would be hydrolysis.\n*   viii) dilute H2SO4 → This would be desulfonation.\n*   ix) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nLet's reconsider the order of the final steps. What if the sequence is:\n1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  Nitrate to get **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is the minor product (para is major), so this is not a high-yield route.\n3.  Reduce to **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  Sulfonate. The -NH2 is a strong o,p-director. It would direct para to the -NH2 group (position 4). This gives **4-amino-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  Nitrate. This is getting complicated and unlikely.\n\nLet's go back to the most logical sequence that uses a blocking group to achieve a difficult substitution pattern. The sequence in Option A is the most chemically sophisticated. Let's assume there is a typo and reconstruct the final steps logically.\n\n**Corrected Logical Sequence (based on the spirit of Option A):**\n1.  **Benzene** -> **tert-Butylbenzene** (Friedel-Crafts)\n2.  -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation, blocking para position)\n3.  -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (Nitration, directed ortho by t-Bu and meta by -SO3H)\n    *At this point, we have the t-butyl and nitro groups in a 1,3-relationship, with a blocking group at position 4.*\n4.  -> **Desulfonation** (dilute H2SO4, heat) -> **1-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *Now we have t-butyl and nitro meta to each other. We need to introduce the ethoxy group at position 2.*\n5.  -> **Reduction** (Fe/HCl) -> **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n6.  -> **Diazotization** (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt.\n7.  -> **Hydrolysis** (H2O, heat) -> **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n8.  -> **Etherification** (NaOH, EtBr) -> **1-tert-butyl-3-ethoxybenzene**.\n9.  -> **Nitration** -> The -OEt is an o,p director, and -tBu is an o,p director. Both will direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. This will not give the desired product.\n\nThere must be a different way. Let's reconsider the structure again. The key is the relationship between the three groups. The -OEt and -NO2 are meta. This suggests one was put on while the other was a meta-director. The -tBu and -NO2 are ortho. This is very difficult to achieve.\n\nLet's reconsider the options as written, however strange they seem. The question asks which of the *following options* would work. It's possible one of them contains a valid, albeit obscure, pathway. The sequence in A is the only one that uses a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for complex substitution patterns. Despite the confusing steps, it holds the most promise. Let's assume the sequence is intended to be followed exactly as written and there's a chemical reason for it. No other option gets even close to a plausible synthesis for this specific isomer. Options B, C, and D involve steps in orders that are chemically unsound for a high-yield synthesis (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a highly deactivated ring, or nitration orders that would give the wrong isomers).\n\nGiven the complexity and the specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern, the pathway must involve careful manipulation of directing groups. The sequence of (1) Alkylation, (2) Blocking the para position with sulfonation, and (3) Directing a third group to the ortho position is a classic, powerful strategy. The subsequent steps are for converting the existing groups into the final desired functionalities. While the exact sequence of steps vi-viii in option A is confusingly written, the overall strategy outlined in steps i-v is the only one presented that has a chance of correctly positioning the carbon skeleton and the first two functional groups (or their precursors) for a complex trisubstituted benzene. The other options fail at an earlier stage by producing the wrong isomers in high yield. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws in the later steps, represents the most viable synthetic strategy among the choices.\n\nFinal check of the logic for Option A's core strategy:\n-   i) Benzene -> t-Butylbenzene (OK)\n-   ii) t-Butylbenzene -> 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (OK, blocks para)\n-   iii) -> 4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (OK, forces ortho nitration)\n-   iv) -> 2-amino-4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (OK, reduction)\n-   v) -> Diazonium salt (OK)\n-   vi-ix) These steps must convert the -N2+ to -OEt and remove the -SO3H, and add the final -NO2. The target has the nitro group at position 3, ortho to the t-butyl group. The sequence as written has the nitro group at position 2 (from step iii). This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-read the target name: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n- C1: OEt\n- C2: tBu\n- C3: NO2\n\nLet's re-trace Option A to see if it makes this product.\n- Step iii gives a benzene ring with substituents at C1(t-Bu), C2(NO2), C4(SO3H).\n- Step iv gives C1(t-Bu), C2(NH2), C4(SO3H).\n- Step v gives C1(t-Bu), C2(N2+), C4(SO3H).\n- If we hydrolyze this (H2O/heat), we get C1(t-Bu), C2(OH), C4(SO3H).\n- If we then desulfonate (dilute H2SO4), we get C1(t-Bu), C2(OH). This is **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n- If we then nitrate this, the strong -OH director will place the -NO2 at position 4 or 6, not 3.\n- If we first etherify to get **2-tert-butylethoxybenzene** and then nitrate, the strong -OEt director will also place the -NO2 at position 4 or 6.\n\nThere is no way Option A, or any simple variation of it, produces the target molecule. All options provided are flawed. However, in a multiple-choice question of this nature, one must choose the \"best\" option, which is typically the one that employs the most correct strategic principles, even if flawed in detail. The principle of using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control regiochemistry is the most advanced and appropriate strategy presented. Option A is the only one that uses this. The flaws in the later steps of all options suggest there may be an error in the question or options provided. But based on applying the most sound synthetic strategy, A is the most plausible attempt.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the target molecule's name and it should have been 4-nitro instead of 3-nitro. In that case, the sequence: 2-tert-butylphenol -> etherification -> nitration would work. But that is not an option.\n\nGiven the provided choices, and the fact that this is a selection problem, we must identify the most likely intended answer. The blocking group strategy is powerful and correct for achieving otherwise difficult substitution patterns. Option A is the only one that correctly applies this principle at the start. The subsequent steps are a series of standard transformations, even if their ordering seems problematic. It is the most plausible choice among a set of flawed options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene with a high yield, a multi-step process involving careful control of regiochemistry is required. The target molecule has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The synthesis must correctly place these groups, which have competing directing effects.\n\nAnalysis of the options reveals that most contain chemically unfeasible steps or would lead to incorrect isomers. However, the set of reagents provided in option B, while presented in a scrambled order, are the necessary components for a logical, albeit complex, synthesis. The correct, high-yield pathway involves the use of a blocking group to control the positions of the incoming substituents.\n\nThe logical synthesis route is as follows:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration**: Tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. For this synthesis, the minor ortho-product, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, must be separated and carried forward.\n3.  **Reduction**: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using a reducing agent like iron in acidic solution (Fe/HCl), yielding 2-tert-butylaniline.\n4.  **Diazotization**: The resulting amine is treated with nitrous acid (generated from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt.\n5.  **Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is then heated in an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+, H2O/Heat) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming 2-tert-butylphenol.\n6.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Group)**: 2-tert-butylphenol is treated with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The strongly directing -OH group places the sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group at the para position, yielding 4-hydroxy-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site on the ring.\n7.  **Second Nitration**: The blocked intermediate is now nitrated (HNO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the only available activated position, which is ortho to both the -OH and -tBu groups (position 2 relative to the phenol), forming 2-nitro-4-hydroxy-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n8.  **Desulfonation (Deblocking)**: The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid. This step yields 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis**: Finally, the phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group by treating it with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form the phenoxide, followed by reaction with ethyl bromide (EtBr). This produces the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nWhile the sequence of reagents in option B is not listed in the correct synthetic order, it is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents to perform this valid synthetic pathway. The other options include chemically impossible steps, such as attempting to diazotize a nitro compound or nitrate a diazonium salt. Therefore, option B represents the correct collection of reactions required for the synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's examine the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\nThe key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Develop a General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis of polysubstituted benzenes requires careful consideration of the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The -OEt group is an ether. Ethers are commonly formed via the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **The Main Challenge:** The core of the problem is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Let's analyze its structure:\n    *   -OH at C1\n    *   -tBu at C2\n    *   -NO2 at C3\n    The -OH group (a strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is a very difficult arrangement to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on a phenol, as the -OH group would direct nitration to the *ortho* (C2, C6) and *para* (C4) positions.\n\n*   **Plausible Strategy:** To overcome this directing group conflict, a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and/or the conversion of one functional group into another is necessary. The use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a temporary blocking group is a common and powerful technique. It can be introduced to block a reactive position (like the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (ii) produces p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Step (iv) attempts to react this with NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines (-NH2), not nitro compounds (-NO2). This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) creates a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate this diazonium salt using fuming sulfuric acid. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would decompose under these harsh conditions. This step is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence includes sulfonation (step viii) followed immediately by desulfonation (step ix). This is a redundant and pointless pair of steps. The sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully. It appears complex and contains a strange step, but let's trace the logic.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs *ortho*, and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **Steps vi, vii, viii:** This is the most complex part. The sequence as written has a problematic step (vi, nitrating a diazonium salt). However, it's highly likely there is a typo in the order of these steps. A chemically logical sequence would be to first convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, then nitrate, then desulfonate. Let's see if that works:\n        *   **Let's assume the intended order was (v) → (vii) → (vi) → (viii):**\n        *   **(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this phenol. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   -OH (at C2) is a strong *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -tBu (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -SO3H (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   Remarkably, all three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5. This would be a highly selective nitration. Let's assume substitution occurs at C3. The product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group from C1. The resulting molecule has -OH at C2, -NO2 at C3, and -tBu at C4. Renaming this according to IUPAC rules (phenol is the parent), we get **3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Wait, this is an isomer of our target precursor!** The target precursor is 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This means even with a logical reordering, sequence A does not produce the exact target molecule.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the steps of the correct option. However, when forced to choose the best option among the given choices:\n*   Options B, C, and D contain clear, fundamental chemical errors that make them invalid.\n*   Option A outlines a sophisticated and strategically sound plan: it uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, followed by functional group interconversions. While it contains a questionable step (vi) as written, and even a logical reordering leads to an isomer, its overall framework is far superior to the other options. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"most plausible\" or \"least incorrect\" pathway. The strategy employed in option A is the only one that demonstrates a correct approach to solving this type of complex synthesis problem.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the intended answer, despite its apparent flaws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of the directing effects of various substituents on a benzene ring. The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the target molecule:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is at position 1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** is at position 2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** is at position 3.\n\nThe key substituent relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe final step is almost certainly the formation of the ether from a phenol (a Williamson ether synthesis), meaning step (ix) `NaOH/EtBr` is the last step, and the precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The challenge is to synthesize this specific phenol isomer in high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts by making p-tert-butylnitrobenzene, which is the major product of nitrating tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent steps lead to the formation of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. Etherification of this compound would yield 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the desired product, but not the correct one. This pathway does not lead to the target molecule.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii), the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, is problematic as the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. This makes the proposed sequence inefficient and unlikely to proceed in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** This sequence has an illogical order of reactions. For instance, it attempts diazotization (iv) before the formation of an amine (viii). This sequence is not chemically viable.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** This sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy using a blocking group, which is often necessary for high-yield synthesis of specific isomers. Let's analyze the key steps:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is the sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but strongly favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. This step forms **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**, effectively \"blocking\" the para position. This is a crucial step for controlling the position of the next substituent.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the nitration of 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. The tert-butyl group directs *ortho* and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta*. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group (position 2). This forces the formation of **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This intermediate correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-(tert-butyl)-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **The subsequent steps (vi, vii, viii)** in the option as written are confusing and likely contain a typographical error. However, the initial sequence (i-v) has successfully constructed a complex intermediate with the correct relative positioning of the key groups, which can then be converted to the desired phenol. A plausible continuation would involve replacing the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (hydrolysis, step vii) and then removing the sulfonic acid blocking group (desulfonation, step viii) to yield the required phenol precursor, which is then etherified (step ix).\n\nDespite the likely typo in the later steps, the initial strategy of using a sulfonic acid blocking group (steps i, ii, iii) is the most logical and effective way to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or follow illogical pathways. Therefore, sequence B represents the most chemically sound approach.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with a bulky group like tert-butyl adjacent to two other substituents, is sterically hindered and challenging to achieve through direct substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving blocking groups or the modification of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option. A common strategy in such problems is to identify any chemically nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the diazotization of an amine formed in step (iv). Step (vi) involves reacting the resulting diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard or logical transformation for a diazonium salt. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iii) is the sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The product is a sulfonic acid. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), but this reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), which is not present. This sequence is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Similar to option B, this sequence involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard synthetic step for introducing a sulfonic acid group in this manner. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This option does not contain any fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Each reagent is used in a context where a reaction can occur. Let's analyze the sequence in detail to see if it leads to the target product.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nLet's trace the reaction path for option A.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is *o,p*-directing, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In strong acid (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n    *   Substrate: 4-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ is at C1 and -tBu is at C4.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to the positions *meta* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the positions *ortho* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 or C5).\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt**: This is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, we have synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The target is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. Our product is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. The difference is the position of the tert-butyl group (C2 vs. C4).\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. Under these acidic and heating conditions, reversible Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur, leading to the migration of the tert-butyl group. The reaction mixture equilibrates towards the most thermodynamically stable isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the stability of the isomer we have (1-ethoxy-4-tBu-3-nitrobenzene) and the target isomer (1-ethoxy-2-tBu-3-nitrobenzene).\n    *   **Our isomer**: The tBu group is at C4, which is *para* to the activating -OEt group and *ortho* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   **Target isomer**: The tBu group is at C2, which is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups. This position is extremely sterically hindered.\n    *   The rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly crowded C2 position is thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, this sequence will not produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the synthesis described in option A does not lead to the named target product via a straightforward thermodynamic argument, it is the only option that presents a chemically plausible sequence of reactions. Options B, C, and D contain steps that are nonsensical in standard organic synthesis (e.g., attempting diazotization without an amine, or reacting a diazonium salt with nitrating mixture). In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" answer. Option A is the best choice because it is free from the fundamental flaws that invalidate the other options. It is likely that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target molecule or in the design of the synthetic pathway. However, based on eliminating the impossible options, A remains the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and typically requires a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group manipulations.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product. We will keep track of the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. For clarity, we'll initially number the substituents based on their order of introduction relative to the first substituent placed on the ring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. We now have a -tBu group on the ring. Let's place it at C1.\n    *   Intermediate: **tert-butylbenzene** (tBu at C1).\n\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically less hindered *para* position (C4). The sulfonic acid group will serve as a blocking group.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is nitration. We have an *o,p*-director (-tBu at C1) and a *m*-director (-SO₃H at C4).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to C2 and C6 (ortho positions).\n    *   The -SO₃H group directs to C2 and C6 (meta positions).\n    *   Both groups direct the nitration to the same positions (C2/C6). The reaction proceeds cleanly.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NO₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4). Note that the -tBu and -NO₂ groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NH₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second nitration. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C6, as C2/C4 are substituted).\n    *   -N₂⁺ at C2 is a *m*-director (directs to C4/C6, C4 is substituted).\n    *   -SO₃H at C4 is a *m*-director (directs to C2/C6, C2 is substituted).\n    *   All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to C6. This is a highly specific reaction.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4, NO₂ at C6).\n\n*   **vii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   This step involves two key transformations that occur upon heating in aqueous acid:\n        1.  **Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt**: The -N₂⁺ group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group.\n        2.  **Desulfonation**: The -SO₃H group at C4 is removed and replaced by -H.\n    *   The resulting molecule has: -tBu at C1, -OH at C2, and -NO₂ at C6.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H₂SO₄**\n    *   This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   The -OH group on 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Final Product has: -tBu at C1, -OEt at C2, -NO₂ at C6 (using the original numbering).\n    *   **Let's determine the IUPAC name of this final product.** The -OEt group has the highest priority for numbering, so its carbon is the new C1.\n        *   Original C2 (with -OEt) becomes New C1.\n        *   Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: Original C1 (with -tBu) becomes New C2. Original C6 (with -NO₂) becomes New C3.\n        *   The locants are 1, 2, 3.\n        *   The name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This matches the target molecule. Therefore, sequence A is a valid and high-yield pathway.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly)**\n\n*   **Option B & C:** Both start by nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which predominantly forms the *para* isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern in a high-yield synthesis. Furthermore, step (iv) in option B (NaNO₂/HCl) is applied to an intermediate without an amino group, which is incorrect. Step (vii) in option C leads to an isomer of the target, not the target itself.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, *meta*-directing group (-NH₂-AlCl₃). This would lead to *m*-tert-butylaniline, which does not have the required substitution pattern for subsequent steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions described in Option A is the only one that correctly utilizes blocking groups and directing effects to systematically build the desired 1,2,3-substituted aromatic ring with high regioselectivity at each step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents to devise a logical synthetic pathway.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), -NO2 (nitro).\n*   **Positions:** They are on adjacent carbons (1, 2, and 3).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nThe relative positions are key:\n*   -OEt (1) and -tBu (2) are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt (1) and -NO2 (3) are meta to each other.\n*   -tBu (2) and -NO2 (3) are ortho to each other.\n\nA meta relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the nitro group (-NO2) is unusual for a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) nitration. This suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the manipulation of directing groups. Let's evaluate the given options.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a strongly deactivated ring. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to form a diazonium salt (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the substrate at this point does not contain a primary aromatic amine group. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    *   This sequence of reagents is chemically illogical. For instance, it prepares a diazonium salt in step (v), then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi) before hydrolyzing it in step (vii). This sequence is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace the synthesis described by this sequence of reagents, assuming a logical reordering to make chemical sense, as the listed order is also problematic (e.g., sulfonation at the end). The key is the combination of reagents provided. A plausible synthesis using these reagents to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern is as follows:\n\n**Proposed Logical Synthesis based on Reagents in Option D (reordered):**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group primarily to the sterically accessible para position.\n3.  **iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n4.  **iv) 4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline:** This is a crucial step. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2). The tert-butyl group at C4 also directs to C2 (its meta position, but the amino group's ortho-directing effect dominates). While direct nitration of anilines can be complex, it is the necessary step to install the nitro group at the required position relative to the other groups.\n5.  **v) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt:** Diazotization of the primary amine.\n6.  **vi) 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol:** The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group.\n7.  **vii) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThis sequence successfully uses the reagents from Option D (ignoring the final sulfonation/desulfonation steps which are unnecessary for this product) to produce an isomer, `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`. However, none of the options, when interpreted literally or reordered logically, directly produce the target molecule `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` in high yield.\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided in the options. Given the choices, Option D outlines a sequence of reactions that is the most chemically plausible, despite leading to an isomeric product and having a confusing order. The key transformations (FC-alkylation, nitration, reduction, second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) represent a valid, multi-step synthetic strategy. The other options contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities. Therefore, Option D is the \"best\" choice among a flawed set of options, likely representing the intended, albeit incorrectly stated, synthetic plan.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the order of the reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the relative positions and directing effects:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   The final product has a 1, 2, 3 substitution pattern, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful use of blocking groups to achieve a high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for controlling regiochemistry. The -SO3H group is a deactivating, *meta*-director that can be added and later removed (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group directs *ortho* to itself (position 2), and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta* to itself (position 2). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group creates a diazonium salt, **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step as written is unusual. However, in the context of the full synthesis, it's likely a flawed representation of a step or part of a more complex transformation. Given the subsequent steps, the overall goal is to replace the original amino group with a hydroxyl and introduce a new nitro group in the correct final position. Often in complex problems like this, one step may be non-standard or represent a rearrangement.\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** Desulfonation removes the sulfonic acid group, yielding **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** This sequence seems out of order with the previous steps.\n\nLet's reconsider the sequence. A logical synthesis would need to create the 2-tBu, 3-NO2 phenol precursor. The sequence in Option A is the only one that utilizes the crucial strategy of adding a blocking group (sulfonation) and later removing it (desulfonation). This is the most powerful technique presented in the options to overcome standard directing effects and achieve a complex substitution pattern. While some steps appear mechanistically questionable as written, the overall strategy is the most plausible for a high-yield synthesis of a complex molecule like the target. The other options (B, C, D) follow more straightforward reaction paths that, based on standard directing rules, would lead to different isomers and not the desired 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. For instance, options B and C would likely produce an isomer with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Option D also leads to an intermediate with the wrong substitution pattern. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws, represents the correct strategic approach.\n\nLet's re-examine the steps of A assuming there might be a rearrangement or a non-obvious outcome. The presence of both sulfonation and desulfonation is the strongest indicator that this is the intended path for a complex regiochemical problem. No other option provides a mechanism to override the strong para-directing nature of the tert-butyl group.\n\nFinal evaluation points towards Option A being the intended answer because it is the only one that includes the necessary strategic steps (use of a removable blocking group) to synthesize a sterically hindered, 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, even if the details of one or two steps are ambiguous or potentially contain typos.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step to ensure the correct final arrangement (substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Target Molecule**: The final product has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2). Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a multi-step approach with careful control of regiochemistry, as placing a third group between two existing meta-substituents is sterically hindered.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: Let's analyze the sequence presented in Option C, as the other options contain significant chemical impossibilities in their sequences.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**: This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director for subsequent reactions.\n    *   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**: This nitration step produces a mixture of ortho and para products. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer, 1-(tert-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene. However, the ortho isomer is also formed and would need to be separated to continue the synthesis. While not a high-yield step for the ortho product, it is a chemically possible transformation.\n    *   **iii) 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-(tert-butyl)aniline**: This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   **iv) 2-(tert-butyl)aniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: In the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director (directing to positions 3, 5, and 1). Both groups, therefore, direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This makes the formation of the desired 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline plausible, although a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer is likely.\n    *   **v) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt**: This is a standard diazotization reaction of a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   **vi) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in an aqueous acidic solution.\n    *   **vii) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the final ethoxy ether product.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The sequence of reactions i through vii in option C provides a chemically logical, albeit not perfectly high-yield, pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps listed in option C, (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4, are the reagents for a blocking group strategy that could have been used to improve the yield of step (ii), but they are superfluous in the context of the sequence as presented. The other options contain more severe flaws: Option A attempts to use a diazotization reagent on a molecule without an amine group. Option B follows a sequence that would lead to p-tert-butylethoxybenzene. Option D begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is generally unsuccessful due to the Lewis acid catalyst complexing with the basic amine. Therefore, Option C represents the most viable synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAfter a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and considering the directing effects of the various functional groups, a plausible high-yield synthesis route can be determined. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions, which corresponds to option D, with the understanding that some steps are standard multi-part procedures.\n\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n\n*   **Step ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene because the bulky tert-butyl group sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n\n*   **Step iii) Fe/HCl:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group. 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to 4-tert-butylaniline. The resulting amino group (-NH2) is a strong activating *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Step iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step represents the nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines can be problematic due to oxidation and the formation of anilinium ions in the strong acid, which would direct *meta*. To achieve the desired regiochemistry, the highly activating amino group is typically first protected by acetylation (e.g., with acetic anhydride) to form an acetanilide. This amide is still a potent *o,p*-director but is less prone to side reactions. The position *para* to the directing group is already occupied by the tert-butyl group, so nitration occurs at the *ortho* position, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide. A subsequent hydrolysis step (acid or base-catalyzed) would then remove the acetyl protecting group to give **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This entire protection-nitration-deprotection sequence is often abbreviated in multi-step synthesis problems.\n\n*   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, is converted into a diazonium salt at low temperatures.\n\n*   **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is first deprotonated by a base (NaOH) to form a more nucleophilic phenoxide ion. This ion then attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) in an SN2 reaction to form an ether. This converts 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol into **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement (ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl). The final two steps are designed to rearrange the substitution pattern to the desired 1,2,3-arrangement through a clever use of a blocking group and an *ipso*-substitution (substitution at a position already occupied by a non-hydrogen substituent).\n\n*   **Step viii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is a sulfonation reaction. The goal is to replace the tert-butyl group with a nitro group. To do this, the position *ortho* to the nitro group and *meta* to the ethoxy group (position 3) must be activated for a subsequent step. However, a more direct interpretation involves an *ipso*-nitration, where a bulky group like tert-butyl is replaced by the incoming nitro group. Often, sulfonation is used to block a position, but in this context, it's more likely that steps viii and ix are part of a more complex transformation or there is a flaw in the proposed sequence.\n\nHowever, if we re-evaluate the options and the target molecule, it becomes clear that there is a significant error in all the provided choices, as none of them logically lead to the final product 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence in option D leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target compound. The subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D do not correct this.\n\nGiven the constraints of the multiple-choice question, there is likely an error in the question itself or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" sequence that correctly assembles a trisubstituted benzene with the given reagents, option D is the most chemically plausible for the first seven steps, despite leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe step-by-step constraint-based analysis successfully identified a single viable synthetic pathway.\n\n1.  **Constraint 1 (Friedel-Crafts Feasibility):** Option A was eliminated because it attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring, which is not a feasible reaction. Options B, C, and D correctly place this step at the beginning.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2 (Logical FGI Order):** The conversion of a nitro group to an ethoxy group requires a specific sequence: reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, and ether synthesis. Option C violates this by placing diazotization before reduction. Options B and D maintain the correct relative order of these steps.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3 (Diazonium Salt Instability):** This was the decisive constraint. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and must be used immediately. Option D fails because it forms a diazonium salt and then attempts a harsh nitration reaction, which would destroy the intermediate. Option B correctly follows the diazotization with hydrolysis, a standard and immediate consumption of the unstable salt.\n\nTherefore, only Option B presents a chemically logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substituted product, despite the likely low yield of some steps and the extraneous final two steps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with two ortho,para-directing groups (ethoxy, tert-butyl) and one meta-directing group (nitro). The arrangement is complex, suggesting that a multi-step synthesis with careful control of directing effects, possibly involving blocking groups, is necessary.\n\nI propose that the correct path involves a blocking group strategy. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this as it can be added to block a position and later removed. Option D begins with a sequence that aligns with this strategy:\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but for steric reasons, sulfonation will overwhelmingly occur at the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This blocks the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. Now, the tert-butyl group directs ortho (to positions 2 and 6) and the sulfonic acid group directs meta (to positions 3 and 5). However, looking at the starting material (4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid), the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2, C6) are meta to the sulfonic acid group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, and nitration should occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n\nThis initial sequence represents a sound and sophisticated strategy required for such a synthesis. While the rest of the steps in option D appear jumbled, this strong start makes it the most plausible intended path. My first action will be to search and confirm the regioselectivity of this key nitration step.\n\n**Skeptic:** The Proposer's argument hinges on the initial steps of Option D being a sound \"blocking group\" strategy. The search results confirm that sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene yields the para product and that using blocking groups is a valid strategy for complex syntheses. However, the Proposer's own analysis of the subsequent nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid is critical. Both the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) direct incoming electrophiles to the same positions (C3 and C5, relative to the sulfonic acid at C1). This is confirmed by the principles of additive effects in disubstituted benzenes. This means the nitration product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nThis intermediate has the nitro and tert-butyl groups *ortho* to each other. In the final target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are also *ortho* to each other. This seems promising. However, the skeptic points out that to get from the intermediate to the product, the sulfonic acid group must be replaced by an ethoxy group, and the positions must align.\n\nLet's trace the consequence of forming 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:\n- Intermediate structure: SO3H at C1, H at C2, NO2 at C3, tBu at C4.\n- Target structure: OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n\nThis requires the t-butyl group to move from C4 to C2, which is a skeletal rearrangement not possible with the given reagents. Therefore, the entire premise that this path leads to the product is flawed. All logical chemical pathways constructed so far fail to produce the target molecule in high yield. The options provided are either chemically impossible (B, C), lead to the wrong, non-rearrangeable isomer (A), or are based on a strategy that also leads to the wrong isomer (D). Rule 3 from search result also states that substitution rarely occurs between two meta-substituents due to steric hindrance, which makes the formation of any 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring challenging.\n\n**Decision:** The debate reveals that none of the provided options represent a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the named target molecule. There are irreconcilable inconsistencies in the directing effects and the resulting substitution patterns. Option A describes a clear sequence of reactions that leads to a different, specific isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B and C contain impossible steps. Option D proposes a valid strategy (blocking group) but the steps are out of order and the strategy itself does not lead to the correct final structure based on established principles of regioselectivity.\n\nGiven that a choice must be made from the provided options, and acknowledging the high probability of an error in the question's target name or reaction sequences, the most logical approach is to identify the option that describes a coherent, albeit flawed, sequence of established chemical reactions.\n\nOption A is the only one that presents a sequence of individually plausible reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, nitration of an aniline derivative, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) that would lead to a defined trisubstituted nitroaromatic product, even if it's not the one named in the question. The other options contain either impossible steps or a sequence so jumbled that it cannot be rationally interpreted. Therefore, Option A is the \"least wrong\" answer, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Key Structural Features:**\n    *   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (three adjacent groups) benzene ring.\n    *   The structure is sterically crowded due to the bulky tert-butyl group being positioned between the other two substituents.\n    *   The directing effects of the groups are in conflict. For example, the strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO₂ group, an arrangement that is very difficult to achieve by direct nitration of an ethoxy-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThese features strongly indicate that a simple, linear sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions, is necessary to control the regiochemistry and achieve a high yield.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nWe must analyze each sequence of reactions for chemical feasibility and its ability to produce the target isomer.\n\n*   **Options with Fundamental Flaws:**\n    *   **Option B:** As noted by several candidate answers, this sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (`NaNO₂/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine (-NH₂) group. This is a chemically impossible step, invalidating the entire sequence.\n    *   **Option C:** This option also contains impossible steps. Depending on the exact interpretation, it either attempts diazotization without an amine or tries to perform an unstable reaction on a diazonium salt (e.g., sulfonation). This sequence is not chemically viable.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D:**\n    *   This sequence begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by nitration. Due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, this nitration overwhelmingly produces the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n    *   Subsequent steps (reduction to an amine, another nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and etherification) are individually plausible.\n    *   However, as correctly traced by multiple candidate answers (e.g., 7, 9), this pathway leads to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** or a similar isomer. It does not produce the target 1,2,3-substituted product. The final two steps (sulfonation/desulfonation) are illogical and would not induce the necessary skeletal rearrangement. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:**\n    *   This sequence is the most complex but also the most strategically sound. It is the only option that correctly employs a sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) as a removable blocking group, which is the classic strategy for synthesizing complex isomers.\n    *   Let's trace the path as detailed by the most thorough analyses (e.g., Answer 8):\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation occurs at the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position from further reaction.\n        3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. Both the -tBu group (*ortho*-directing) and the -SO₃H group (*meta*-directing) direct the incoming -NO₂ group to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. At this stage, all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) direct the new nitro group to the only remaining open position (C6). This is another highly specific step.\n        7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations simultaneously: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n        8.  **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This is a redundant step, likely ensuring the completion of step vii.\n        9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether. The -OH group is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   **Final Product Check:** The resulting molecule has -OEt, -tBu, and -NO₂ groups. By IUPAC naming rules, the carbon with the -OEt group is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO₂ group at C3. The final product is indeed **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile complex and containing an uncommon step (nitration of a diazonium salt), the reaction sequence in Option A is the only one that is chemically sound and leads precisely to the named target molecule. The strategy of using a blocking group is essential for this synthesis, and only Option A employs it correctly. Options B and C contain impossible chemical steps, and Option D leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>"

These represent chemically unsound steps.\n\nOption D presents a sequence of chemically plausible reactions, but as analyzed, it leads to an isomer of the target molecule, specifically **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, depending on the conditions for the nitration of the aniline intermediate. The final two steps in option D (sulfonation followed by desulfonation) are also illogical as they are redundant.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps, and option D, while composed of possible reactions, is illogical and does not lead to the specified product, none of the provided options represent a correct, high-yield synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

This choice is made by eliminating the other options as chemically impossible.\n\nA plausible, albeit complex, synthesis that would yield the target molecule involves a blocking group strategy to achieve the correct regiochemistry, followed by a series of functional group transformations. Such a sequence would be:\n1.  **Alkylation** of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation** to install a sulfonic acid group at the para position, blocking it (forms p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid).\n3.  **Nitration**, which is now directed to the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group (forms 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid).\n4.  **Desulfonation** by heating with dilute acid to remove the blocking group, yielding o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n5.  **Reduction** of the nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl) to give o-tert-butylaniline.\n6.  **Nitration** of o-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta) and -tBu (ortho) groups would favor substitution at the C3 and C5 positions. While sterically hindered, reaction at C3 would yield 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.\n7.  **Diazotization** of the amino group using NaNO2/HCl.\n8.  **Hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt by warming in water to replace the N2+ group with an -OH group, forming 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis** with NaOH and ethyl bromide to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding the final product.\n\nThis valid sequence does not match any of the options provided. Therefore, based on the provided choices, there is no correct answer. I am unable to provide an answer in the requested format as all options are incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no correct option among the choices.>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Final Answer Determination\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Structure:**\n*   The molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because the directing effects of the groups often conflict. A high-yield synthesis typically requires a well-thought-out strategy, often involving blocking groups.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Common Steps and Reagents:**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3):** Attaches a tert-butyl group. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the para position.\n*   **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Adds a nitro (-NO2) group, which is a meta-director.\n*   **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** Adds a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group, which is a meta-director. This reaction is reversible and the -SO3H group can be used as a \"blocking group\" to protect a position (usually the para position) and then be removed later with dilute acid and heat.\n*   **Reduction of Nitro Group (Fe/HCl):** Converts -NO2 to an amino (-NH2) group.\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** Converts an amino (-NH2) group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** Replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** Converts a hydroxyl (-OH) group into an ethoxy (-OEt) group.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A:**\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming sulfonyl group to the para position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Now, the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. This is a key step to force ortho-nitration.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amine.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **diazonium salt**. The amine at position 2 is converted to a diazonium group.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Diazonium salt → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid. *Note: The prompt has a potential typo in option A, listing `HNO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4` as separate steps after diazotization. The logical step here is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.*\n7.  **vii) dilute H2SO4 / Heat (Desulfonation):** 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **3-tert-butyl-1-phenol (or m-tert-butylphenol)**. This step removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. *Correction: The order of steps is crucial. Let's re-examine the sequence provided in the options.*\n\nLet's reconsider the order of the final steps based on chemical principles. After step (v), we have the diazonium salt of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   **Path 1:** First, remove the blocking group, then convert the diazonium salt. Desulfonation requires heat and dilute acid, which would also hydrolyze the diazonium salt. So, steps (vi) and (vii) likely happen concurrently. This would yield **3-tert-butyl-6-hydroxyphenol**, which is not the desired intermediate.\n\n*   **Path 2:** First, replace the diazonium salt, then remove the blocking group.\n    *   Step A: Diazonium salt + H2O/Heat → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Step B: 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → **3-tert-butylphenol**. This is not the correct precursor. We need the t-butyl group ortho to the hydroxyl group.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental flaw in the initial steps of Option A if the goal is to have the t-butyl and hydroxyl groups ortho to each other. Let's re-read the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The t-butyl is at C2, ethoxy at C1. They are ortho.\n\nLet's try a different logical construction that leads to the correct isomer arrangement and see if it matches any option.\n\n**A More Plausible Synthetic Route:**\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Phenol → **2-tert-butylphenol** (+ 4-tert-butylphenol). The ortho isomer is needed and can be separated. The -OH group is a powerful ortho, para-director.\n3.  **ii) NaOH/EtBr:** 2-tert-butylphenol → **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene**. Convert the phenol to the ether. The -OEt group is also a strong ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene → **Product mixture**. The -OEt group directs to positions 4 and 6. The t-butyl group directs to position 4. Nitration would predominantly occur at position 4, giving 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-4-nitrobenzene. This does not yield the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining the 1,2,3-substitution pattern suggests that one of the groups must be introduced via a method that circumvents the usual directing rules, or the directing properties of the groups are manipulated during the synthesis. The use of a blocking group is the most common strategy for this.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Option A, assuming there might be a misunderstanding of the reactions.\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene\n*   ii) SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n*   iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n*   iv) Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt\n*   vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → This step is highly unusual. It is not a standard Sandmeyer reaction.\n*   vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → This would be hydrolysis.\n*   viii) dilute H2SO4 → This would be desulfonation.\n*   ix) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nLet's reconsider the order of the final steps. What if the sequence is:\n1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  Nitrate to get **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is the minor product (para is major), so this is not a high-yield route.\n3.  Reduce to **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  Sulfonate. The -NH2 is a strong o,p-director. It would direct para to the -NH2 group (position 4). This gives **4-amino-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  Nitrate. This is getting complicated and unlikely.\n\nLet's go back to the most logical sequence that uses a blocking group to achieve a difficult substitution pattern. The sequence in Option A is the most chemically sophisticated. Let's assume there is a typo and reconstruct the final steps logically.\n\n**Corrected Logical Sequence (based on the spirit of Option A):**\n1.  **Benzene** -> **tert-Butylbenzene** (Friedel-Crafts)\n2.  -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation, blocking para position)\n3.  -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (Nitration, directed ortho by t-Bu and meta by -SO3H)\n    *At this point, we have the t-butyl and nitro groups in a 1,3-relationship, with a blocking group at position 4.*\n4.  -> **Desulfonation** (dilute H2SO4, heat) -> **1-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *Now we have t-butyl and nitro meta to each other. We need to introduce the ethoxy group at position 2.*\n5.  -> **Reduction** (Fe/HCl) -> **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n6.  -> **Diazotization** (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt.\n7.  -> **Hydrolysis** (H2O, heat) -> **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n8.  -> **Etherification** (NaOH, EtBr) -> **1-tert-butyl-3-ethoxybenzene**.\n9.  -> **Nitration** -> The -OEt is an o,p director, and -tBu is an o,p director. Both will direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. This will not give the desired product.\n\nThere must be a different way. Let's reconsider the structure again. The key is the relationship between the three groups. The -OEt and -NO2 are meta. This suggests one was put on while the other was a meta-director. The -tBu and -NO2 are ortho. This is very difficult to achieve.\n\nLet's reconsider the options as written, however strange they seem. The question asks which of the *following options* would work. It's possible one of them contains a valid, albeit obscure, pathway. The sequence in A is the only one that uses a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for complex substitution patterns. Despite the confusing steps, it holds the most promise. Let's assume the sequence is intended to be followed exactly as written and there's a chemical reason for it. No other option gets even close to a plausible synthesis for this specific isomer. Options B, C, and D involve steps in orders that are chemically unsound for a high-yield synthesis (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a highly deactivated ring, or nitration orders that would give the wrong isomers).\n\nGiven the complexity and the specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern, the pathway must involve careful manipulation of directing groups. The sequence of (1) Alkylation, (2) Blocking the para position with sulfonation, and (3) Directing a third group to the ortho position is a classic, powerful strategy. The subsequent steps are for converting the existing groups into the final desired functionalities. While the exact sequence of steps vi-viii in option A is confusingly written, the overall strategy outlined in steps i-v is the only one presented that has a chance of correctly positioning the carbon skeleton and the first two functional groups (or their precursors) for a complex trisubstituted benzene. The other options fail at an earlier stage by producing the wrong isomers in high yield. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws in the later steps, represents the most viable synthetic strategy among the choices.\n\nFinal check of the logic for Option A's core strategy:\n-   i) Benzene -> t-Butylbenzene (OK)\n-   ii) t-Butylbenzene -> 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (OK, blocks para)\n-   iii) -> 4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (OK, forces ortho nitration)\n-   iv) -> 2-amino-4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (OK, reduction)\n-   v) -> Diazonium salt (OK)\n-   vi-ix) These steps must convert the -N2+ to -OEt and remove the -SO3H, and add the final -NO2. The target has the nitro group at position 3, ortho to the t-butyl group. The sequence as written has the nitro group at position 2 (from step iii). This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-read the target name: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n- C1: OEt\n- C2: tBu\n- C3: NO2\n\nLet's re-trace Option A to see if it makes this product.\n- Step iii gives a benzene ring with substituents at C1(t-Bu), C2(NO2), C4(SO3H).\n- Step iv gives C1(t-Bu), C2(NH2), C4(SO3H).\n- Step v gives C1(t-Bu), C2(N2+), C4(SO3H).\n- If we hydrolyze this (H2O/heat), we get C1(t-Bu), C2(OH), C4(SO3H).\n- If we then desulfonate (dilute H2SO4), we get C1(t-Bu), C2(OH). This is **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n- If we then nitrate this, the strong -OH director will place the -NO2 at position 4 or 6, not 3.\n- If we first etherify to get **2-tert-butylethoxybenzene** and then nitrate, the strong -OEt director will also place the -NO2 at position 4 or 6.\n\nThere is no way Option A, or any simple variation of it, produces the target molecule. All options provided are flawed. However, in a multiple-choice question of this nature, one must choose the \"best\" option, which is typically the one that employs the most correct strategic principles, even if flawed in detail. The principle of using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control regiochemistry is the most advanced and appropriate strategy presented. Option A is the only one that uses this. The flaws in the later steps of all options suggest there may be an error in the question or options provided. But based on applying the most sound synthetic strategy, A is the most plausible attempt.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the target molecule's name and it should have been 4-nitro instead of 3-nitro. In that case, the sequence: 2-tert-butylphenol -> etherification -> nitration would work. But that is not an option.\n\nGiven the provided choices, and the fact that this is a selection problem, we must identify the most likely intended answer. The blocking group strategy is powerful and correct for achieving otherwise difficult substitution patterns. Option A is the only one that correctly applies this principle at the start. The subsequent steps are a series of standard transformations, even if their ordering seems problematic. It is the most plausible choice among a set of flawed options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene with a high yield, a multi-step process involving careful control of regiochemistry is required. The target molecule has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The synthesis must correctly place these groups, which have competing directing effects.\n\nAnalysis of the options reveals that most contain chemically unfeasible steps or would lead to incorrect isomers. However, the set of reagents provided in option B, while presented in a scrambled order, are the necessary components for a logical, albeit complex, synthesis. The correct, high-yield pathway involves the use of a blocking group to control the positions of the incoming substituents.\n\nThe logical synthesis route is as follows:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration**: Tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. For this synthesis, the minor ortho-product, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, must be separated and carried forward.\n3.  **Reduction**: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using a reducing agent like iron in acidic solution (Fe/HCl), yielding 2-tert-butylaniline.\n4.  **Diazotization**: The resulting amine is treated with nitrous acid (generated from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt.\n5.  **Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is then heated in an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+, H2O/Heat) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming 2-tert-butylphenol.\n6.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Group)**: 2-tert-butylphenol is treated with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The strongly directing -OH group places the sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group at the para position, yielding 4-hydroxy-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site on the ring.\n7.  **Second Nitration**: The blocked intermediate is now nitrated (HNO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the only available activated position, which is ortho to both the -OH and -tBu groups (position 2 relative to the phenol), forming 2-nitro-4-hydroxy-3-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n8.  **Desulfonation (Deblocking)**: The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid. This step yields 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis**: Finally, the phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group by treating it with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form the phenoxide, followed by reaction with ethyl bromide (EtBr). This produces the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nWhile the sequence of reagents in option B is not listed in the correct synthetic order, it is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents to perform this valid synthetic pathway. The other options include chemically impossible steps, such as attempting to diazotize a nitro compound or nitrate a diazonium salt. Therefore, option B represents the correct collection of reactions required for the synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's examine the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\nThe key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Develop a General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis of polysubstituted benzenes requires careful consideration of the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The -OEt group is an ether. Ethers are commonly formed via the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **The Main Challenge:** The core of the problem is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Let's analyze its structure:\n    *   -OH at C1\n    *   -tBu at C2\n    *   -NO2 at C3\n    The -OH group (a strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is a very difficult arrangement to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on a phenol, as the -OH group would direct nitration to the *ortho* (C2, C6) and *para* (C4) positions.\n\n*   **Plausible Strategy:** To overcome this directing group conflict, a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and/or the conversion of one functional group into another is necessary. The use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a temporary blocking group is a common and powerful technique. It can be introduced to block a reactive position (like the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (ii) produces p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Step (iv) attempts to react this with NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines (-NH2), not nitro compounds (-NO2). This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) creates a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate this diazonium salt using fuming sulfuric acid. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would decompose under these harsh conditions. This step is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence includes sulfonation (step viii) followed immediately by desulfonation (step ix). This is a redundant and pointless pair of steps. The sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully. It appears complex and contains a strange step, but let's trace the logic.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs *ortho*, and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **Steps vi, vii, viii:** This is the most complex part. The sequence as written has a problematic step (vi, nitrating a diazonium salt). However, it's highly likely there is a typo in the order of these steps. A chemically logical sequence would be to first convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, then nitrate, then desulfonate. Let's see if that works:\n        *   **Let's assume the intended order was (v) → (vii) → (vi) → (viii):**\n        *   **(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this phenol. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   -OH (at C2) is a strong *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -tBu (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -SO3H (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   Remarkably, all three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5. This would be a highly selective nitration. Let's assume substitution occurs at C3. The product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group from C1. The resulting molecule has -OH at C2, -NO2 at C3, and -tBu at C4. Renaming this according to IUPAC rules (phenol is the parent), we get **3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Wait, this is an isomer of our target precursor!** The target precursor is 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This means even with a logical reordering, sequence A does not produce the exact target molecule.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the steps of the correct option. However, when forced to choose the best option among the given choices:\n*   Options B, C, and D contain clear, fundamental chemical errors that make them invalid.\n*   Option A outlines a sophisticated and strategically sound plan: it uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, followed by functional group interconversions. While it contains a questionable step (vi) as written, and even a logical reordering leads to an isomer, its overall framework is far superior to the other options. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"most plausible\" or \"least incorrect\" pathway. The strategy employed in option A is the only one that demonstrates a correct approach to solving this type of complex synthesis problem.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the intended answer, despite its apparent flaws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of the directing effects of various substituents on a benzene ring. The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the target molecule:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is at position 1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** is at position 2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** is at position 3.\n\nThe key substituent relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe final step is almost certainly the formation of the ether from a phenol (a Williamson ether synthesis), meaning step (ix) `NaOH/EtBr` is the last step, and the precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The challenge is to synthesize this specific phenol isomer in high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts by making p-tert-butylnitrobenzene, which is the major product of nitrating tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent steps lead to the formation of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. Etherification of this compound would yield 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the desired product, but not the correct one. This pathway does not lead to the target molecule.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii), the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, is problematic as the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. This makes the proposed sequence inefficient and unlikely to proceed in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** This sequence has an illogical order of reactions. For instance, it attempts diazotization (iv) before the formation of an amine (viii). This sequence is not chemically viable.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** This sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy using a blocking group, which is often necessary for high-yield synthesis of specific isomers. Let's analyze the key steps:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is the sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but strongly favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. This step forms **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**, effectively \"blocking\" the para position. This is a crucial step for controlling the position of the next substituent.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the nitration of 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. The tert-butyl group directs *ortho* and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta*. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group (position 2). This forces the formation of **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This intermediate correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-(tert-butyl)-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **The subsequent steps (vi, vii, viii)** in the option as written are confusing and likely contain a typographical error. However, the initial sequence (i-v) has successfully constructed a complex intermediate with the correct relative positioning of the key groups, which can then be converted to the desired phenol. A plausible continuation would involve replacing the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (hydrolysis, step vii) and then removing the sulfonic acid blocking group (desulfonation, step viii) to yield the required phenol precursor, which is then etherified (step ix).\n\nDespite the likely typo in the later steps, the initial strategy of using a sulfonic acid blocking group (steps i, ii, iii) is the most logical and effective way to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or follow illogical pathways. Therefore, sequence B represents the most chemically sound approach.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with a bulky group like tert-butyl adjacent to two other substituents, is sterically hindered and challenging to achieve through direct substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving blocking groups or the modification of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option. A common strategy in such problems is to identify any chemically nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the diazotization of an amine formed in step (iv). Step (vi) involves reacting the resulting diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard or logical transformation for a diazonium salt. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iii) is the sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The product is a sulfonic acid. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), but this reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), which is not present. This sequence is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Similar to option B, this sequence involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard synthetic step for introducing a sulfonic acid group in this manner. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This option does not contain any fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Each reagent is used in a context where a reaction can occur. Let's analyze the sequence in detail to see if it leads to the target product.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nLet's trace the reaction path for option A.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is *o,p*-directing, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In strong acid (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n    *   Substrate: 4-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ is at C1 and -tBu is at C4.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to the positions *meta* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the positions *ortho* to it (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 or C5).\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt**: This is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, we have synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The target is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. Our product is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. The difference is the position of the tert-butyl group (C2 vs. C4).\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. Under these acidic and heating conditions, reversible Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur, leading to the migration of the tert-butyl group. The reaction mixture equilibrates towards the most thermodynamically stable isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the stability of the isomer we have (1-ethoxy-4-tBu-3-nitrobenzene) and the target isomer (1-ethoxy-2-tBu-3-nitrobenzene).\n    *   **Our isomer**: The tBu group is at C4, which is *para* to the activating -OEt group and *ortho* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   **Target isomer**: The tBu group is at C2, which is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups. This position is extremely sterically hindered.\n    *   The rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly crowded C2 position is thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, this sequence will not produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the synthesis described in option A does not lead to the named target product via a straightforward thermodynamic argument, it is the only option that presents a chemically plausible sequence of reactions. Options B, C, and D contain steps that are nonsensical in standard organic synthesis (e.g., attempting diazotization without an amine, or reacting a diazonium salt with nitrating mixture). In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" answer. Option A is the best choice because it is free from the fundamental flaws that invalidate the other options. It is likely that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target molecule or in the design of the synthetic pathway. However, based on eliminating the impossible options, A remains the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and typically requires a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group manipulations.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product. We will keep track of the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. For clarity, we'll initially number the substituents based on their order of introduction relative to the first substituent placed on the ring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. We now have a -tBu group on the ring. Let's place it at C1.\n    *   Intermediate: **tert-butylbenzene** (tBu at C1).\n\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically less hindered *para* position (C4). The sulfonic acid group will serve as a blocking group.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is nitration. We have an *o,p*-director (-tBu at C1) and a *m*-director (-SO₃H at C4).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to C2 and C6 (ortho positions).\n    *   The -SO₃H group directs to C2 and C6 (meta positions).\n    *   Both groups direct the nitration to the same positions (C2/C6). The reaction proceeds cleanly.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NO₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4). Note that the -tBu and -NO₂ groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NH₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second nitration. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C6, as C2/C4 are substituted).\n    *   -N₂⁺ at C2 is a *m*-director (directs to C4/C6, C4 is substituted).\n    *   -SO₃H at C4 is a *m*-director (directs to C2/C6, C2 is substituted).\n    *   All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to C6. This is a highly specific reaction.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4, NO₂ at C6).\n\n*   **vii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   This step involves two key transformations that occur upon heating in aqueous acid:\n        1.  **Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt**: The -N₂⁺ group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group.\n        2.  **Desulfonation**: The -SO₃H group at C4 is removed and replaced by -H.\n    *   The resulting molecule has: -tBu at C1, -OH at C2, and -NO₂ at C6.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H₂SO₄**\n    *   This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   The -OH group on 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Final Product has: -tBu at C1, -OEt at C2, -NO₂ at C6 (using the original numbering).\n    *   **Let's determine the IUPAC name of this final product.** The -OEt group has the highest priority for numbering, so its carbon is the new C1.\n        *   Original C2 (with -OEt) becomes New C1.\n        *   Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: Original C1 (with -tBu) becomes New C2. Original C6 (with -NO₂) becomes New C3.\n        *   The locants are 1, 2, 3.\n        *   The name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This matches the target molecule. Therefore, sequence A is a valid and high-yield pathway.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly)**\n\n*   **Option B & C:** Both start by nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which predominantly forms the *para* isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern in a high-yield synthesis. Furthermore, step (iv) in option B (NaNO₂/HCl) is applied to an intermediate without an amino group, which is incorrect. Step (vii) in option C leads to an isomer of the target, not the target itself.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, *meta*-directing group (-NH₂-AlCl₃). This would lead to *m*-tert-butylaniline, which does not have the required substitution pattern for subsequent steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions described in Option A is the only one that correctly utilizes blocking groups and directing effects to systematically build the desired 1,2,3-substituted aromatic ring with high regioselectivity at each step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents to devise a logical synthetic pathway.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), -NO2 (nitro).\n*   **Positions:** They are on adjacent carbons (1, 2, and 3).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nThe relative positions are key:\n*   -OEt (1) and -tBu (2) are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt (1) and -NO2 (3) are meta to each other.\n*   -tBu (2) and -NO2 (3) are ortho to each other.\n\nA meta relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the nitro group (-NO2) is unusual for a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) nitration. This suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the manipulation of directing groups. Let's evaluate the given options.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a strongly deactivated ring. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to form a diazonium salt (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the substrate at this point does not contain a primary aromatic amine group. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    *   This sequence of reagents is chemically illogical. For instance, it prepares a diazonium salt in step (v), then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi) before hydrolyzing it in step (vii). This sequence is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace the synthesis described by this sequence of reagents, assuming a logical reordering to make chemical sense, as the listed order is also problematic (e.g., sulfonation at the end). The key is the combination of reagents provided. A plausible synthesis using these reagents to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern is as follows:\n\n**Proposed Logical Synthesis based on Reagents in Option D (reordered):**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group primarily to the sterically accessible para position.\n3.  **iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n4.  **iv) 4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline:** This is a crucial step. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2). The tert-butyl group at C4 also directs to C2 (its meta position, but the amino group's ortho-directing effect dominates). While direct nitration of anilines can be complex, it is the necessary step to install the nitro group at the required position relative to the other groups.\n5.  **v) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt:** Diazotization of the primary amine.\n6.  **vi) 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol:** The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group.\n7.  **vii) 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThis sequence successfully uses the reagents from Option D (ignoring the final sulfonation/desulfonation steps which are unnecessary for this product) to produce an isomer, `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`. However, none of the options, when interpreted literally or reordered logically, directly produce the target molecule `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` in high yield.\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided in the options. Given the choices, Option D outlines a sequence of reactions that is the most chemically plausible, despite leading to an isomeric product and having a confusing order. The key transformations (FC-alkylation, nitration, reduction, second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) represent a valid, multi-step synthetic strategy. The other options contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities. Therefore, Option D is the \"best\" choice among a flawed set of options, likely representing the intended, albeit incorrectly stated, synthetic plan.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the order of the reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the relative positions and directing effects:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   The final product has a 1, 2, 3 substitution pattern, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful use of blocking groups to achieve a high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for controlling regiochemistry. The -SO3H group is a deactivating, *meta*-director that can be added and later removed (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group directs *ortho* to itself (position 2), and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta* to itself (position 2). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group creates a diazonium salt, **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step as written is unusual. However, in the context of the full synthesis, it's likely a flawed representation of a step or part of a more complex transformation. Given the subsequent steps, the overall goal is to replace the original amino group with a hydroxyl and introduce a new nitro group in the correct final position. Often in complex problems like this, one step may be non-standard or represent a rearrangement.\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** Desulfonation removes the sulfonic acid group, yielding **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** This sequence seems out of order with the previous steps.\n\nLet's reconsider the sequence. A logical synthesis would need to create the 2-tBu, 3-NO2 phenol precursor. The sequence in Option A is the only one that utilizes the crucial strategy of adding a blocking group (sulfonation) and later removing it (desulfonation). This is the most powerful technique presented in the options to overcome standard directing effects and achieve a complex substitution pattern. While some steps appear mechanistically questionable as written, the overall strategy is the most plausible for a high-yield synthesis of a complex molecule like the target. The other options (B, C, D) follow more straightforward reaction paths that, based on standard directing rules, would lead to different isomers and not the desired 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. For instance, options B and C would likely produce an isomer with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Option D also leads to an intermediate with the wrong substitution pattern. Therefore, Option A, despite its apparent flaws, represents the correct strategic approach.\n\nLet's re-examine the steps of A assuming there might be a rearrangement or a non-obvious outcome. The presence of both sulfonation and desulfonation is the strongest indicator that this is the intended path for a complex regiochemical problem. No other option provides a mechanism to override the strong para-directing nature of the tert-butyl group.\n\nFinal evaluation points towards Option A being the intended answer because it is the only one that includes the necessary strategic steps (use of a removable blocking group) to synthesize a sterically hindered, 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, even if the details of one or two steps are ambiguous or potentially contain typos.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step to ensure the correct final arrangement (substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Target Molecule**: The final product has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2). Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a multi-step approach with careful control of regiochemistry, as placing a third group between two existing meta-substituents is sterically hindered.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: Let's analyze the sequence presented in Option C, as the other options contain significant chemical impossibilities in their sequences.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**: This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director for subsequent reactions.\n    *   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**: This nitration step produces a mixture of ortho and para products. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer, 1-(tert-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene. However, the ortho isomer is also formed and would need to be separated to continue the synthesis. While not a high-yield step for the ortho product, it is a chemically possible transformation.\n    *   **iii) 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-(tert-butyl)aniline**: This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    *   **iv) 2-(tert-butyl)aniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: In the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director (directing to positions 3, 5, and 1). Both groups, therefore, direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This makes the formation of the desired 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline plausible, although a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer is likely.\n    *   **v) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt**: This is a standard diazotization reaction of a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   **vi) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in an aqueous acidic solution.\n    *   **vii) 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the final ethoxy ether product.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The sequence of reactions i through vii in option C provides a chemically logical, albeit not perfectly high-yield, pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps listed in option C, (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4, are the reagents for a blocking group strategy that could have been used to improve the yield of step (ii), but they are superfluous in the context of the sequence as presented. The other options contain more severe flaws: Option A attempts to use a diazotization reagent on a molecule without an amine group. Option B follows a sequence that would lead to p-tert-butylethoxybenzene. Option D begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is generally unsuccessful due to the Lewis acid catalyst complexing with the basic amine. Therefore, Option C represents the most viable synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAfter a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and considering the directing effects of the various functional groups, a plausible high-yield synthesis route can be determined. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions, which corresponds to option D, with the understanding that some steps are standard multi-part procedures.\n\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n\n*   **Step ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene because the bulky tert-butyl group sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n\n*   **Step iii) Fe/HCl:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group. 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to 4-tert-butylaniline. The resulting amino group (-NH2) is a strong activating *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Step iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step represents the nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines can be problematic due to oxidation and the formation of anilinium ions in the strong acid, which would direct *meta*. To achieve the desired regiochemistry, the highly activating amino group is typically first protected by acetylation (e.g., with acetic anhydride) to form an acetanilide. This amide is still a potent *o,p*-director but is less prone to side reactions. The position *para* to the directing group is already occupied by the tert-butyl group, so nitration occurs at the *ortho* position, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide. A subsequent hydrolysis step (acid or base-catalyzed) would then remove the acetyl protecting group to give **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This entire protection-nitration-deprotection sequence is often abbreviated in multi-step synthesis problems.\n\n*   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, is converted into a diazonium salt at low temperatures.\n\n*   **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is first deprotonated by a base (NaOH) to form a more nucleophilic phenoxide ion. This ion then attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) in an SN2 reaction to form an ether. This converts 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol into **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement (ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl). The final two steps are designed to rearrange the substitution pattern to the desired 1,2,3-arrangement through a clever use of a blocking group and an *ipso*-substitution (substitution at a position already occupied by a non-hydrogen substituent).\n\n*   **Step viii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is a sulfonation reaction. The goal is to replace the tert-butyl group with a nitro group. To do this, the position *ortho* to the nitro group and *meta* to the ethoxy group (position 3) must be activated for a subsequent step. However, a more direct interpretation involves an *ipso*-nitration, where a bulky group like tert-butyl is replaced by the incoming nitro group. Often, sulfonation is used to block a position, but in this context, it's more likely that steps viii and ix are part of a more complex transformation or there is a flaw in the proposed sequence.\n\nHowever, if we re-evaluate the options and the target molecule, it becomes clear that there is a significant error in all the provided choices, as none of them logically lead to the final product 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence in option D leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target compound. The subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D do not correct this.\n\nGiven the constraints of the multiple-choice question, there is likely an error in the question itself or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" sequence that correctly assembles a trisubstituted benzene with the given reagents, option D is the most chemically plausible for the first seven steps, despite leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe step-by-step constraint-based analysis successfully identified a single viable synthetic pathway.\n\n1.  **Constraint 1 (Friedel-Crafts Feasibility):** Option A was eliminated because it attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring, which is not a feasible reaction. Options B, C, and D correctly place this step at the beginning.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2 (Logical FGI Order):** The conversion of a nitro group to an ethoxy group requires a specific sequence: reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, and ether synthesis. Option C violates this by placing diazotization before reduction. Options B and D maintain the correct relative order of these steps.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3 (Diazonium Salt Instability):** This was the decisive constraint. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and must be used immediately. Option D fails because it forms a diazonium salt and then attempts a harsh nitration reaction, which would destroy the intermediate. Option B correctly follows the diazotization with hydrolysis, a standard and immediate consumption of the unstable salt.\n\nTherefore, only Option B presents a chemically logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substituted product, despite the likely low yield of some steps and the extraneous final two steps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with two ortho,para-directing groups (ethoxy, tert-butyl) and one meta-directing group (nitro). The arrangement is complex, suggesting that a multi-step synthesis with careful control of directing effects, possibly involving blocking groups, is necessary.\n\nI propose that the correct path involves a blocking group strategy. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this as it can be added to block a position and later removed. Option D begins with a sequence that aligns with this strategy:\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but for steric reasons, sulfonation will overwhelmingly occur at the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This blocks the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. Now, the tert-butyl group directs ortho (to positions 2 and 6) and the sulfonic acid group directs meta (to positions 3 and 5). However, looking at the starting material (4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid), the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2, C6) are meta to the sulfonic acid group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, and nitration should occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n\nThis initial sequence represents a sound and sophisticated strategy required for such a synthesis. While the rest of the steps in option D appear jumbled, this strong start makes it the most plausible intended path. My first action will be to search and confirm the regioselectivity of this key nitration step.\n\n**Skeptic:** The Proposer's argument hinges on the initial steps of Option D being a sound \"blocking group\" strategy. The search results confirm that sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene yields the para product and that using blocking groups is a valid strategy for complex syntheses. However, the Proposer's own analysis of the subsequent nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid is critical. Both the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) direct incoming electrophiles to the same positions (C3 and C5, relative to the sulfonic acid at C1). This is confirmed by the principles of additive effects in disubstituted benzenes. This means the nitration product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nThis intermediate has the nitro and tert-butyl groups *ortho* to each other. In the final target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are also *ortho* to each other. This seems promising. However, the skeptic points out that to get from the intermediate to the product, the sulfonic acid group must be replaced by an ethoxy group, and the positions must align.\n\nLet's trace the consequence of forming 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:\n- Intermediate structure: SO3H at C1, H at C2, NO2 at C3, tBu at C4.\n- Target structure: OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n\nThis requires the t-butyl group to move from C4 to C2, which is a skeletal rearrangement not possible with the given reagents. Therefore, the entire premise that this path leads to the product is flawed. All logical chemical pathways constructed so far fail to produce the target molecule in high yield. The options provided are either chemically impossible (B, C), lead to the wrong, non-rearrangeable isomer (A), or are based on a strategy that also leads to the wrong isomer (D). Rule 3 from search result also states that substitution rarely occurs between two meta-substituents due to steric hindrance, which makes the formation of any 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring challenging.\n\n**Decision:** The debate reveals that none of the provided options represent a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for the named target molecule. There are irreconcilable inconsistencies in the directing effects and the resulting substitution patterns. Option A describes a clear sequence of reactions that leads to a different, specific isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B and C contain impossible steps. Option D proposes a valid strategy (blocking group) but the steps are out of order and the strategy itself does not lead to the correct final structure based on established principles of regioselectivity.\n\nGiven that a choice must be made from the provided options, and acknowledging the high probability of an error in the question's target name or reaction sequences, the most logical approach is to identify the option that describes a coherent, albeit flawed, sequence of established chemical reactions.\n\nOption A is the only one that presents a sequence of individually plausible reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, nitration of an aniline derivative, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) that would lead to a defined trisubstituted nitroaromatic product, even if it's not the one named in the question. The other options contain either impossible steps or a sequence so jumbled that it cannot be rationally interpreted. Therefore, Option A is the \"least wrong\" answer, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
