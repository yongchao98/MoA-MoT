Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must identify each compound (A through H) based on the described reactions.\n\n*   **Compound A:** A compound with the formula C3H6 that undergoes bromination in CCl4 must be an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B:** The addition of bromine (Br₂) across the double bond of propene yields **B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C:** Reacting a vicinal dihalide like B with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D:** Passing an alkyne like propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E:** Reacting D with a mixture of two strong acids (the nitrating mixture, conc. HNO₃ and H₂SO₄) results in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This yields **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F:** The reduction of the nitro group in E with iron scrap and HCl converts it to a primary amino group. This forms **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G:** The reaction of a primary aromatic amine (F) with nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a diazotization reaction, which forms **G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H:** The hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (G) with NaOH (and water, upon warming) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate the four statements based on the identities of the compounds. The goal is to find the **incorrect** statement.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature. Therefore, it is a gas. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the formation of the colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction).\n    *   **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, B, and D are chemically correct. Statement C incorrectly describes the outcome of the ferric chloride test for the sterically hindered phenol H.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds in the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** undergoes bromination in CCl₄. This is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This strong base causes double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic trimerization reaction, yielding **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the product of the reaction of Compound D with a mixture of two strong acids (a nitrating mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution produces **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of Compound E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of Compound F with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This reaction produces **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when Compound G is hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, yielding **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are essential precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups at the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only incorrect statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task**: The main goal is to identify the single incorrect statement among the four options provided, based on a sequence of chemical reactions. I need to analyze the provided candidate answers, synthesize their logic, and present a clear, step-by-step solution that leads to the correct choice. The final output must be a Python script that programmatically performs this analysis and prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**: I will trace the reactions step-by-step to identify each compound from A to H. This is the foundational part of the analysis, and all candidate answers agree on this, which gives me high confidence in the identities.\n    *   **A -> B**: C3H6 (propene) + Br2/CCl4 -> 1,2-dibromopropane. This is a standard electrophilic addition.\n    *   **B -> C**: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH -> propyne. This is a double dehydrohalogenation.\n    *   **C -> D**: Propyne + red-hot Fe tube -> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This is a cyclic trimerization.\n    *   **D -> E**: Mesitylene + strong acids (HNO3/H2SO4) -> 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene. This is electrophilic aromatic nitration.\n    *   **E -> F**: Nitro-mesitylene + Fe/HCl -> 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine). This is the reduction of a nitro group.\n    *   **F -> G**: Mesidine + HNO2 -> 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt. This is diazotization.\n    *   **G -> H**: Diazonium salt + NaOH -> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. This is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Statement from the Original Question**: Now I will evaluate each of the four statements using the identified compounds. I must be careful to use the lettering from the original question (A, B, C, D) and not the re-ordered lists seen in some candidate answers.\n\n    *   **Statement A: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n        *   The ferric chloride test for phenols typically gives a violet, blue, or green color.\n        *   However, the two methyl groups at the ortho positions (2 and 6) sterically hinder the phenol's -OH group, preventing the formation of the colored complex with iron(III) chloride.\n        *   This results in a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the FeCl3 reagent itself.\n        *   The statement is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow color, when in fact it describes a negative result. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **Statement B: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene).\n        *   Due to its high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, giving one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent, giving a second signal.\n        *   Since there are no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals are singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **Statement C: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.\n        *   Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for azo dyes, a major class of synthetic colorants. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **Statement D: C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   Compound C is propyne.\n        *   Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at standard room temperature.\n        *   Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: The analysis confirms that statements B, C, and D are correct, while statement A is incorrect. The consensus among the candidate answers, despite their confusing lettering, is that the statement about compound H and the ferric chloride test is the incorrect one. In the original question, this is statement A.\n\n5.  **Plan the Python Code**: I will create a Python script that automates this logical flow.\n    *   It will define the compounds and the statements as given in the original problem.\n    *   It will then print an analysis for each statement, explaining why it is correct or incorrect.\n    *   Finally, it will identify and print the letter corresponding to the single incorrect statement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a sequence of chemical reactions and evaluates statements about the products\n    to identify the incorrect statement, based on the original question's lettering.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the key compounds identified in the reaction sequence.\n    compounds = {\n        'C': 'Propyne',\n        'D': '1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)',\n        'F': '2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesidine)',\n        'H': '2,4,6-Trimethylphenol'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the statements from the original question.\n    statements = [\n        {\n            'option': 'A',\n            'text': 'H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.',\n            'is_correct': False,\n            'explanation': (\n                f\"Incorrect.

Identify the Compounds (A through H)**\n\n*   **Step A → B:** Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. The formula C3H6 corresponds to an alkene or cycloalkane. The reaction is a characteristic electrophilic addition for an alkene. Thus, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The product of bromine addition is **B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n\n*   **Step B → C:** Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base that causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) from the vicinal dihalide to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Step C → D:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Step D → E:** Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This is nitration, an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The product is **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Step E → F:** Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. The product is **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Step F → G:** Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction, forming **G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Step G → H:** Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (and water, with warming). This is a hydrolysis reaction that replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. The final product is **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we will check the validity of each statement based on the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is below standard room temperature. Therefore, it is a gas. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.

The solution simply retains the original pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction).

This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are correct. The statement that is incorrect is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆) + Br₂/CCl₄ → Compound B**: The molecular formula C₃H₆ corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The addition of bromine across the double bond yields **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n\n*   **Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C**: The reaction of a vicinal dihalide (like B) with a strong base like alcoholic KOH causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Compound C + red-hot Fe tube → Compound D**: Passing an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D + strong acids → Compound E**: The reaction of an aromatic compound with a mixture of strong acids (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄) is nitration. This electrophilic aromatic substitution yields **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F**: The reaction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. This produces **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F + HNO₂ → Compound G**: The reaction of a primary aromatic amine with nitrous acid (HNO₂) at low temperatures is a diazotization reaction, which forms **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Compound G + NaOH → Compound H**: The hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (by warming with water, often in a basic or acidic medium) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. This forms **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe question asks for the incorrect statement. Based on the analysis, statement B is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds (A-H)**\n\n*   **Compound A** is C3H6, which undergoes bromination in CCl4. This is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH. This strong base causes a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is produced when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic trimerization reaction, where three molecules of propyne combine to form **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is formed when mesitylene reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution yields **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the result of the reduction of the nitro group in Compound E using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This produces **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of the primary aromatic amine (F) with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This results in **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when the diazonium salt (G) is hydrolyzed (reacts with NaOH and water, usually with warming), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to the molecule's high symmetry, there are only two distinct types of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the three equivalent C-H bonds on the aromatic ring. Neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. Therefore, the spectrum correctly shows two singlet signals. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is sterically hindered by the two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Primary aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only incorrect statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds**\n\nFirst, we must trace the reaction sequence to identify each compound from A to H. All candidate answers show a strong consensus on the identity of each compound.\n\n*   **Compound A** is identified as **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)** because it has the formula C₃H₆ and undergoes bromination, a characteristic reaction of alkenes.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of bromine addition to propene, resulting in **1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed by the double dehydrohalogenation of compound B with alcoholic KOH, yielding **propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is the result of the cyclic trimerization of propyne in a red-hot iron tube, forming the symmetrical aromatic compound **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is formed by the nitration of mesitylene, yielding **2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the reduction product of compound E, resulting in **2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of compound F, creating the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is the final product from the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G, which is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nWith the compounds identified, we can now evaluate each statement.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent, producing a second signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals are singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are essential precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This creates significant steric hindrance that prevents the formation of the colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction). This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical reactions and the properties of the resulting compounds, statements A, B, and C are correct. Statement D is incorrect because it misrepresents a negative chemical test result as a positive one.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1.

The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to propene or cyclopropane. The reaction conditions (Br2/CCl4) are characteristic of an electrophilic addition to an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine across the double bond of propene. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This strong base causes a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction, where three molecules of propyne combine to form **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is formed when mesitylene (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (a nitrating mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4). This electrophilic aromatic substitution yields **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of the nitro group in Compound E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid. This produces **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of the primary aromatic amine (F) with nitrous acid (HNO2). This results in **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed by the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (G) with sodium hydroxide, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2.

The molecular formula CₙH₂ₙ and the reaction type (bromination, an electrophilic addition) indicate that **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine across the double bond of propene.

Trace the Reaction Sequence and Identify Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6) + Br2/CCl4 → Compound B**: The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to an alkene or cycloalkane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**. The bromine adds across the double bond to form **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br))**.\n\n*   **Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C**: Alcoholic KOH is a strong base that causes dehydrohalogenation. Since Compound B is a vicinal dihalide, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne. Thus, **Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Compound C + red-hot iron tube → Compound D**: This is a classic cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction for alkynes. Three molecules of propyne cyclize to form the symmetrical aromatic compound **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D + strong acids → Compound E**: The mixture of two strong acids refers to the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The product is **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F**: Iron scrap and hydrochloric acid are used for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. The product is **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F + HNO2 → Compound G**: A primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures) in a diazotization reaction. The product is **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Compound G + NaOH → Compound H**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed (typically by warming in an aqueous solution) to replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given statements based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct color like violet, blue, or green due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions.

The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction). Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature.

Due to the molecule's high degree of symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are correct. The statement that is incorrect is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must identify each compound (A through H) based on the described reactions. This involves recognizing standard transformations in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Compound A to B**: Compound A (C₃H₆) undergoes bromination in CCl₄. The molecular formula C₃H₆ corresponds to propene or cyclopropane. The reaction with Br₂/CCl₄ is a characteristic electrophilic addition for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**. The addition of bromine across the double bond yields **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n\n*   **Compound B to C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base that causes dehydrohalogenation. Since B is a vicinal dihalide (bromine atoms on adjacent carbons), two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Compound C to D**: Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction. Three molecules of propyne cyclize to form the symmetrical aromatic compound **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D to E**: Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution adds a nitro group (-NO₂) to the ring, yielding **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E to F**: Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. The product is **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F to G**: Compound F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂, generated from NaNO₂/HCl at low temperatures). This diazotization reaction forms **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Compound G to H**: The diazonium salt (G) reacts with sodium hydroxide (which facilitates hydrolysis by water, usually upon warming). The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we will evaluate the validity of each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature (approx. 25 °C). Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule is highly symmetrical. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause spin-spin splitting for either group, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction). Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing the reaction sequence and evaluating each statement, we find that statements A, B, and D are correct. Statement C is incorrect because the described compound gives a negative ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds**\n\n*   **Compound A** (C₃H₆) undergoes bromination in CCl₄, a characteristic reaction of an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of bromine addition to propene. Thus, **B is 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This double dehydrohalogenation yields an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic trimerization reaction that produces **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the result of the nitration of mesitylene (D) with a mixture of strong acids (conc. HNO₃ and H₂SO₄), yielding **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of the nitro group in E with iron (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This produces **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂), resulting in the **G, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when the diazonium salt G is hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group to form **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to the molecule's high symmetry, there are only two distinct types of protons: the three protons on the aromatic ring and the nine protons of the three methyl groups. Since neither group has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, the spectrum correctly shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    Compound C is propyne. It is a colorless gas at room temperature (boiling point -23.2 °C) and is described as extremely flammable, with gas/air mixtures being explosive. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. It is an aromatic amine that is commercially used as a precursor or intermediate for dyes, such as Acid Blue 129. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct red, blue, green, or purple color upon forming a complex with the iron ion. However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (the positions next to the -OH group) are sterically hindered. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a negative test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow-brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of Compounds A through H**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6)** reacts with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. The double bond breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each carbon. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when Compound B reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This strong base causes the elimination of two molecules of hydrogen bromide (HBr) in a double dehydrohalogenation reaction, forming an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction where three molecules of the alkyne join to form an aromatic ring. The product is **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the product of the reaction of Compound D with a mixture of two strong acids (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) that adds a nitro group (-NO₂) to the ring. The product is **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed when Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group (-NH₂). The product is **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed when Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), typically generated in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl at low temperatures. This is a diazotization reaction, converting the primary amine to a diazonium salt. The product is **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide, which facilitates the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2.

This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.

Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must identify each compound (A through H) based on the described reactions.\n\n*   **Compound A:** A compound with the formula C3H6 that undergoes bromination in CCl4 must be an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B:** The addition of bromine (Br₂) across the double bond of propene yields **B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C:** Reacting a vicinal dihalide like B with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D:** Passing an alkyne like propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E:** Reacting D with a mixture of two strong acids (the nitrating mixture, conc. HNO₃ and H₂SO₄) results in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This yields **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F:** The reduction of the nitro group in E with iron scrap and HCl converts it to a primary amino group. This forms **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G:** The reaction of a primary aromatic amine (F) with nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a diazotization reaction, which forms **G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H:** The hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (G) with NaOH (and water, upon warming) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate the four statements based on the identities of the compounds. The goal is to find the **incorrect** statement.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is well below standard room temperature. Therefore, it is a gas. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl₃) test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the formation of the colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction).\n    *   **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, B, and D are chemically correct.

Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This strong base causes double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic trimerization reaction, yielding **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the product of the reaction of Compound D with a mixture of two strong acids (a nitrating mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution produces **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of Compound E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of Compound F with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This reaction produces **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when Compound G is hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, yielding **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are essential precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes.

Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal.

The final output must be a Python script that programmatically performs this analysis and prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**: I will trace the reactions step-by-step to identify each compound from A to H. This is the foundational part of the analysis, and all candidate answers agree on this, which gives me high confidence in the identities.\n    *   **A -> B**: C3H6 (propene) + Br2/CCl4 -> 1,2-dibromopropane. This is a standard electrophilic addition.\n    *   **B -> C**: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH -> propyne. This is a double dehydrohalogenation.\n    *   **C -> D**: Propyne + red-hot Fe tube -> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This is a cyclic trimerization.\n    *   **D -> E**: Mesitylene + strong acids (HNO3/H2SO4) -> 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene.

A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the FeCl3 reagent itself.\n        *   The statement is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow color, when in fact it describes a negative result. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **Statement B: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene).\n        *   Due to its high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, giving one signal.

Compound H is 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test for phenols typically gives a violet/blue/green color. However, this specific phenol is sterically hindered by methyl groups at both ortho positions, which prevents the formation of the colored complex. This leads to a negative test.

Statement A is incorrect.\nThe incorrect statement is option A.\n<<<A>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to identify the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identify the Compounds (A through H)**\n\n*   **Step A → B:** Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. The formula C3H6 corresponds to an alkene or cycloalkane. The reaction is a characteristic electrophilic addition for an alkene. Thus, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The product of bromine addition is **B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n\n*   **Step B → C:** Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base that causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) from the vicinal dihalide to form an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Step C → D:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Step D → E:** Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This is nitration, an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The product is **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Step E → F:** Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. The product is **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Step F → G:** Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction, forming **G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Step G → H:** Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (and water, with warming). This is a hydrolysis reaction that replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. The final product is **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we will check the validity of each statement based on the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which is below standard room temperature. Therefore, it is a gas. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex.\n    *   However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the formation of the colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative.\n    *   A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs. The solution simply retains the original pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction). This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are correct. The statement that is incorrect is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆) + Br₂/CCl₄ → Compound B**: The molecular formula C₃H₆ corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **. The addition of bromine across the double bond yields **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n\n*   **Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C**: The reaction of a vicinal dihalide (like B) with a strong base like alcoholic KOH causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Compound C + red-hot Fe tube → Compound D**: Passing an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D + strong acids → Compound E**: The reaction of an aromatic compound with a mixture of strong acids (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄) is nitration. This electrophilic aromatic substitution yields **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F**: The reaction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. This produces **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F + HNO₂ → Compound G**: The reaction of a primary aromatic amine with nitrous acid (HNO₂) at low temperatures is a diazotization reaction, which forms **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Compound G + NaOH → Compound H**: The hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (by warming with water, often in a basic or acidic medium) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. This forms **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement based on the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe question asks for the incorrect statement. Based on the analysis, statement B is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds (A-H)**\n\n*   **Compound A** is C3H6, which undergoes bromination in CCl4. This is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH. This strong base causes a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is produced when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic trimerization reaction, where three molecules of propyne combine to form **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is formed when mesitylene reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution yields **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the result of the reduction of the nitro group in Compound E using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This produces **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of the primary aromatic amine (F) with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This results in **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when the diazonium salt (G) is hydrolyzed (reacts with NaOH and water, usually with warming), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to the molecule's high symmetry, there are only two distinct types of protons: the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups and the three protons of the three equivalent C-H bonds on the aromatic ring. Neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. Therefore, the spectrum correctly shows two singlet signals. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.

Primary aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes.

All candidate answers show a strong consensus on the identity of each compound.\n\n*   **Compound A** is identified as **propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)** because it has the formula C₃H₆ and undergoes bromination, a characteristic reaction of alkenes.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of bromine addition to propene, resulting in **1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed by the double dehydrohalogenation of compound B with alcoholic KOH, yielding **propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is the result of the cyclic trimerization of propyne in a red-hot iron tube, forming the symmetrical aromatic compound **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is formed by the nitration of mesitylene, yielding **2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is the reduction product of compound E, resulting in **2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of compound F, creating the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is the final product from the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt G, which is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\nWith the compounds identified, we can now evaluate each statement.\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to its high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal.

This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical reactions and the properties of the resulting compounds, statements A, B, and C are correct.

Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups at the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a *negative* test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test.\n    *   **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting, both signals appear as singlets.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental precursors for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes.\n    *   **This statement is correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are correct descriptions of the compounds and their properties. Statement B is incorrect because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a negative ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance; the resulting yellow color is that of the unreacted reagent, not a positive reaction product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must identify each compound (A through H) formed in the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆)** reacts with Br₂ in CCl₄. The molecular formula CₙH₂ₙ and the reaction type (bromination, an electrophilic addition) indicate that **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine across the double bond of propene. Thus, **B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This strong base causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne. Therefore, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form the symmetrical aromatic compound **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the product of the reaction of D with a mixture of two strong acids (a nitrating mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution adds a nitro group to the ring, forming **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of the nitro group in E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This produces the primary aromatic amine **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This converts the amine into **G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when the diazonium salt G is hydrolyzed (e.g., by warming with NaOH solution), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. The final product is **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate the correctness of each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.

A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule is highly symmetrical. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause spin-spin splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are correct descriptions of the compounds and their properties. Statement A is incorrect because it misrepresents a negative ferric chloride test. The yellow color is from the reagent, not from a reaction product, and the test is considered negative due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Trace the Reaction Sequence and Identify Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6) + Br2/CCl4 → Compound B**: The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to an alkene or cycloalkane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**. The bromine adds across the double bond to form **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br))**.\n\n*   **Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C**: Alcoholic KOH is a strong base that causes dehydrohalogenation. Since Compound B is a vicinal dihalide, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne. Thus, **Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Compound C + red-hot iron tube → Compound D**: This is a classic cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction for alkynes. Three molecules of propyne cyclize to form the symmetrical aromatic compound **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D + strong acids → Compound E**: The mixture of two strong acids refers to the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The product is **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F**: Iron scrap and hydrochloric acid are used for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. The product is **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F + HNO2 → Compound G**: A primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures) in a diazotization reaction. The product is **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Compound G + NaOH → Compound H**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed (typically by warming in an aqueous solution) to replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given statements based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct color like violet, blue, or green due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two methyl groups in the ortho positions. This creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the formation of the colored complex. Therefore, the test is negative. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the original pale yellow color of the ferric chloride reagent. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test (a lack of reaction). Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high degree of symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since neither group of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are correct. The statement that is incorrect is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the incorrect statement based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Trace the Chemical Reaction Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must identify each compound (A through H) based on the described reactions. This involves recognizing standard transformations in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Compound A to B**: Compound A (C₃H₆) undergoes bromination in CCl₄. The molecular formula C₃H₆ corresponds to propene or cyclopropane. The reaction with Br₂/CCl₄ is a characteristic electrophilic addition for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**. The addition of bromine across the double bond yields **Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n\n*   **Compound B to C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base that causes dehydrohalogenation. Since B is a vicinal dihalide (bromine atoms on adjacent carbons), two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n\n*   **Compound C to D**: Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction. Three molecules of propyne cyclize to form the symmetrical aromatic compound **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D to E**: Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄). This electrophilic aromatic substitution adds a nitro group (-NO₂) to the ring, yielding **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E to F**: Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group. The product is **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F to G**: Compound F, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂, generated from NaNO₂/HCl at low temperatures). This diazotization reaction forms **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n*   **Compound G to H**: The diazonium salt (G) reacts with sodium hydroxide (which facilitates hydrolysis by water, usually upon warming). The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement**\n\nNow, we will evaluate the validity of each statement based on the properties of the identified compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature (approx. 25 °C). Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule is highly symmetrical. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce a second signal. Since there are no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to cause spin-spin splitting for either group, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex.

Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large and commercially important class of dyes known as azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing the reaction sequence and evaluating each statement, we find that statements A, B, and D are correct. Statement C is incorrect because the described compound gives a negative ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of the Compounds**\n\n*   **Compound A** (C₃H₆) undergoes bromination in CCl₄, a characteristic reaction of an alkene. Therefore, **A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) **.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of bromine addition to propene. Thus, **B is 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This double dehydrohalogenation yields an alkyne. Thus, **C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic trimerization reaction that produces **D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the result of the nitration of mesitylene (D) with a mixture of strong acids (conc. HNO₃ and H₂SO₄), yielding **E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of the nitro group in E with iron (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This produces **F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed by the diazotization of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂), resulting in the **G, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when the diazonium salt G is hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group to form **H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Statements**\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to the molecule's high symmetry, there are only two distinct types of protons: the three protons on the aromatic ring and the nine protons of the three methyl groups. Since neither group has adjacent, non-equivalent protons, the spectrum correctly shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    Compound C is propyne. It is a colorless gas at room temperature (boiling point -23.2 °C) and is described as extremely flammable, with gas/air mixtures being explosive. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. It is an aromatic amine that is commercially used as a precursor or intermediate for dyes, such as Acid Blue 129. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct red, blue, green, or purple color upon forming a complex with the iron ion. However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (the positions next to the -OH group) are sterically hindered. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex, leading to a negative test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution simply retains the pale yellow-brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas the reality is a negative test. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the incorrect statement.\n\n**1. Identification of Compounds A through H**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6)** reacts with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for an alkene. Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂)**.\n*   **Compound B** is the product of the addition of bromine to propene. The double bond breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each carbon. Thus, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br))**.\n*   **Compound C** is formed when Compound B reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This strong base causes the elimination of two molecules of hydrogen bromide (HBr) in a double dehydrohalogenation reaction, forming an alkyne. Therefore, **Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH)**.\n*   **Compound D** is formed when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic cyclic trimerization reaction where three molecules of the alkyne join to form an aromatic ring. The product is **Compound D, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as mesitylene)**.\n*   **Compound E** is the product of the reaction of Compound D with a mixture of two strong acids (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) that adds a nitro group (-NO₂) to the ring. The product is **Compound E, 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   **Compound F** is formed when Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amino group (-NH₂). The product is **Compound F, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine)**.\n*   **Compound G** is formed when Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), typically generated in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl at low temperatures. This is a diazotization reaction, converting the primary amine to a diazonium salt. The product is **Compound G, the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide, which facilitates the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The final product is **Compound H, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**2.
