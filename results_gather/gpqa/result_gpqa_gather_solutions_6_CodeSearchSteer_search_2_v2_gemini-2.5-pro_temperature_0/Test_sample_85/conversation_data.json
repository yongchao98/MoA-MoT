Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThis problem tests two key concepts in organic chemistry:\n*   **Chemoselectivity of Reducing Agents:** Different reducing agents react preferentially with certain functional groups.\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules):** The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nWe must determine the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center in both the starting material and the product.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (`3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`):**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups. Their priorities are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *(Reasoning: The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (in the isobutyl group) rather than a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (`4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`):**\n    The chiral center (C4) is attached to four groups. Their priorities are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *(Reasoning: The carbonyl-containing fragment has higher priority.)*\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The starting ester arm (Priority 1) is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the ether fragment in the lactone (new Priority 2).\n    *   The starting acid arm (Priority 2) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the lactone (new Priority 1).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. Swapping two groups at a chiral center causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The starting ester arm (Priority 1) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the lactone (new Priority 1).\n    *   The starting acid arm (Priority 2) is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the ether fragment in the lactone (new Priority 2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **preserved**. This means the R/S designation is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step analysis of two separate chemical reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two distinct carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a lactone). The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the first critical point. The two reducing agents target different functional groups.\n*   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a selective reagent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does **not** reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThis is the second critical point. The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are ranked as follows:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm) - Highest priority\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - Second priority\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority\n    *(The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), which has a higher atomic number than the hydrogen it is attached to in the acid group.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are ranked as follows:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - Highest priority\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - Second priority\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The ester arm (Priority 1 in the starting material) is reduced and becomes the ether oxygen side of the lactone (Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   The acid arm (Priority 2 in the starting material) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (Priority 1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 5: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The ester arm (Priority 1 in the starting material) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   The acid arm (Priority 2 in the starting material) is reduced and becomes the ether oxygen side of the lactone (Priority 2 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **retained**. This means the R/S designation is also **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials must be the same enantiomer:\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step analysis of two separate chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reagents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity:** Determine which functional group (carboxylic acid or ester) is reduced by each reagent (LiBH₄ and BH₃).\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** Determine how each reaction pathway affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. This will reveal whether the R/S designation is inverted or retained.\n3.  **Deduce Starting Material A:** Apply the analysis from steps 1 and 2 to the first reaction to find the stereochemistry of A.\n4.  **Deduce Starting Material B:** Apply the analysis from steps 1 and 2 to the second reaction to find the stereochemistry of B.\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** Match the conclusions for A and B to the given options.\n\n### **Step-by-step Execution**\n\n**1. Reagent Selectivity**\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, preferentially reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis (CIP Priorities)**\nThe R/S designation depends on the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. The reaction pathways change these groups, which can alter their priorities.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (`3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`):**\n    The chiral carbon (C3) is attached to H, an ethyl group, an acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and an ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n    *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n    *   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    *   Priority 4: `-H`\n    *(The ester arm is higher priority than the acid arm because its oxygen is attached to a carbon, while the acid's oxygen is attached to a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (`4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`):**\n    The chiral carbon (C4) is attached to H, an ethyl group, and two fragments of the lactone ring.\n    *   Priority 1: `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Fragment from the unreduced carbonyl)\n    *   Priority 2: `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Fragment from the reduced carbonyl)\n    *   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    *   Priority 4: `-H`\n\n**3. Deduction for Starting Material A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n*   **Priority Change:**\n    *   The starting ester arm (Priority 1) is reduced, becoming the lower-priority ring fragment (Product Priority 2).\n    *   The starting acid arm (Priority 2) is not reduced, becoming the higher-priority ring fragment (Product Priority 1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. This causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Deduction for Starting Material B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Priority Change:**\n    *   The starting ester arm (Priority 1) is not reduced, becoming the higher-priority ring fragment (Product Priority 1).\n    *   The starting acid arm (Priority 2) is reduced, becoming the lower-priority ring fragment (Product Priority 2).\n*   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups is **retained**. This means the R/S designation is also **retained**. To obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n**5.

Analysis of the Core Chemical Problem**\n\nThe question asks to identify the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, for two different reactions. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding two main concepts:\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** The two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, react with different functional groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** How the chemical transformation affects the R/S designation of the chiral center.\n\n### **2. Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Careful Point 2: Stereochemical Analysis using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). This means the absolute 3D arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The chiral center (C3) is attached to:\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest Priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second Priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P3)**\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest Priority)\n    *(The ester arm is higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), which has a higher atomic number than the hydrogen it's attached to in the acid.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The chiral center (C4) is attached to:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest Priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second Priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P'3)**\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest Priority)\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (P1 in the start) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment in the product (P'2).\n    *   The acid arm (P2 in the start) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the product (P'1).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). A swap of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (P1 in the start) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the product (P'1).\n    *   The acid arm (P2 in the start) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment in the product (P'2).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are maintained (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **5.

It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n2.  **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone. The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the product.\n3.  **Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n4.  **Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules):** The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n### **Step 2: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nWe must determine the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center in both the starting material and the product.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P3)\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P4)\n    *(Reasoning: The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because its oxygen is attached to a carbon (isobutyl group), which has a higher atomic number than the hydrogen the acid's oxygen is attached to.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P'3)\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P'4)\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The starting ester arm (P1) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment of the lactone (P'2).\n    *   The starting acid arm (P2) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl fragment of the lactone (P'1).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1).

The two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a relatively mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, preferentially reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**: The reactions do not alter the absolute three-dimensional arrangement of atoms at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking of the groups attached to this center.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material**: The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are -H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), an acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and an ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`). Comparing the two main arms, the ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group) rather than a hydrogen.\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone)**: The chiral center is now part of a ring. The two ring fragments attached to it are `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the carbonyl side) and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the ether oxygen side). The carbonyl-containing fragment has higher priority.\n        *   Priority 1': `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`\n        *   Priority 2': `-CH₂-CH₂-O-`\n\n3.  **Trace Reaction A**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone`\n    *   **Pathway**: LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   **Priority Mapping**: The starting Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes the Priority 2' group (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`) in the product. The starting Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is not reduced and becomes the Priority 1' group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) in the product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The priorities of the top two groups are swapped.

The two reducing agents used have different selectivities:\n\n*   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest Priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second Priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *(The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (isobutyl group) rather than a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest Priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second Priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The ester arm (P1 in the starting material) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment in the product (P'2).\n    *   The acid arm (P2 in the starting material) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the product (P'1).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). A swap in the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The ester arm (P1 in the starting material) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the product (P'1).\n    *   The acid arm (P2 in the starting material) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment in the product (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze each reaction by considering two key principles: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`) functional group. The two reducing agents target these groups differently:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Stereochemical Consequences (CIP Priorities)**\n\nThe reactions do not alter the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction modifies the functional groups in a way that alters their CIP priority ranking.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon (C3) are H, ethyl, an acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and an ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    1.  **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (The ester arm is higher priority than the acid arm because the chain continues with -O-C, while the acid is -O-H).\n    2.  **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    4.  **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The chiral carbon (C4) is part of a ring. The groups are H, ethyl, and two arms of the ring.\n    1.  **Priority 1:** `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (The arm leading to the carbonyl group).\n    2.  **Priority 2:** `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (The arm leading to the ether oxygen).\n    3.  **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    4.  **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n*   **Priority Mapping:**\n    *   The starting material's Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes the product's Priority 2 group (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n    *   The starting material's Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is not reduced and becomes the product's Priority 1 group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Priority Mapping:**\n    *   The starting material's Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is not reduced and becomes the product's Priority 1 group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`).\n    *   The starting material's Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and becomes the product's Priority 2 group (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is preserved. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the stereochemistry of two starting materials, A and B, based on the stereochemistry of the products they form after reacting with specific reducing agents. This requires understanding three key concepts:\n*   The structure of the starting material and product.\n*   The chemoselectivity of the reducing agents (`LiBH₄` and `BH₃`).\n*   The effect of the chemical transformation on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, which determine the R/S designation.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical point. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two reducible groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **`LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols but does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **`BH₃` (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, readily reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols while being much slower to react with esters.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Stereochemistry (CIP Priorities)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material), so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest Priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second Priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P3)**\n    4.  `-H` - **Lowest Priority (P4)**\n    *(The ester arm is higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (from the isobutyl group) versus a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest Priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second Priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P'3)**\n    4.  `-H` - **Lowest Priority (P'4)**\n\n### **4. Tracing Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group (P1 in the starting material). This group becomes the ether part of the lactone ring (P'2 in the product). The acid group (P2 in the starting material) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl part of the lactone ring (P'1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the two main groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). A swap in the priorities of two groups at a chiral center causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n*   **Pathway:** `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (P2 in the starting material). This group becomes the ether part of the lactone ring (P'2 in the product). The ester group (P1 in the starting material) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl part of the lactone ring (P'1 in the product).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order is preserved (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). Since the priority order is maintained, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials must be the same enantiomer:\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Core Chemistry**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a lactone). This is formed by reducing one of the carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes with the other carbonyl group.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** This is the first critical point.\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)** selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane)** selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThis is the second critical point.

The ester is higher priority than the acid because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen.\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second priority (P2)**.\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P3).\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P4).\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon (C4) are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest priority (P'1)**.\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second priority (P'2)**.\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P'3).\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P'4).\n\n### **3. Trace Each Reaction Path**\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (original **P1**) is reduced and becomes the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (new **P'2**).\n    *   The acid arm (original **P2**) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (new **P'1**).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). Swapping two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (original **P1**) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (new **P'1**).\n    *   The acid arm (original **P2**) is reduced and becomes the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (new **P'2**).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **preserved** (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reagents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reducing agents used have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones. It does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids.

The starting material's second priority group (P2, the acid arm) becomes the product's highest priority group (P'1, the carbonyl fragment).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**.

This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and contains two distinct functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the product.\n*   **Reagents and their Selectivity:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome (R or S) depends on the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. While the reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, the chemical changes can alter the priorities, potentially changing the R/S designation.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (A and B):** The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest Priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second Priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P3)**\n    4.  `-H` - **Lowest Priority (P4)**\n    *(The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the acid's oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Carbonyl side of the ring) - **Highest Priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ether side of the ring) - **Second Priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P'3)**\n    4.  `-H` - **Lowest Priority (P'4)**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n*   **Mapping the Priority Change:**\n    *   The starting ester arm (P1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (P'2).\n    *   The starting acid arm (P2) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (P'1).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 becomes P'2, and P2 becomes P'1). A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Mapping the Priority Change:**\n    *   The starting ester arm (P1) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The starting acid arm (P2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the top two groups is preserved (P1 becomes P'1, and P2 becomes P'2). This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials must be the same enantiomer:\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two separate chemical reactions. The core of the problem lies in understanding the specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of each reducing agent and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations, which are determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material in both cases is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both a carboxylic acid functional group (`-COOH`) and an ester functional group (`-COOiBu`). The two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material), so the absolute 3D arrangement of the atoms is preserved.

A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The starting ester arm (P1) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl fragment of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The starting acid arm (P2) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2).

    "To determine the correct starting materials, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis is required. The solution hinges on three critical points: the specific reactivity of each reducing agent, the assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the groups on the chiral center, and the resulting stereochemical outcome for each reaction.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reducing agents target these groups differently.\n\n*   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does **not** reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions. Therefore, in Reaction A, LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much less reactive towards esters. Therefore, in Reaction B, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: Stereochemical Analysis (CIP Priorities)**\n\nThe R/S designation of the chiral center can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the attached groups, even though the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon (C3) are ranked as follows:\n    1.  **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm). This has higher priority than the acid arm because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), which outranks the hydrogen that the acid's oxygen is bonded to.\n    2.  **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm).\n    3.  **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group).\n    4.  **Priority 4:** `-H`.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon (C4) are ranked as follows:\n    1.  **Priority 1:** `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (The arm of the ring leading to the carbonyl group).\n    2.  **Priority 2:** `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (The arm of the ring leading to the ether oxygen).\n    3.  **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group).\n    4.  **Priority 4:** `-H`.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: Tracing Each Reaction's Stereochemical Outcome**\n\n**Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone`**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n2.  **Priority Change:** The starting material's Priority 1 group (the ester arm) is reduced and becomes the product's Priority 2 group (the ether fragment). The starting material's Priority 2 group (the acid arm) is unreacted and becomes the product's Priority 1 group (the carbonyl fragment).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A single swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product via inversion, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Reaction B: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-lactone`**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n2.  **Priority Change:** The starting material's Priority 1 group (the ester arm) is unreacted and becomes the product's Priority 1 group (the carbonyl fragment). The starting material's Priority 2 group (the acid arm) is reduced and becomes the product's Priority 2 group (the ether fragment).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the top two groups is **retained**. This means the R/S designation is also **retained**.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product via retention, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analysis of the Core Chemical Problem**\n\nThe question asks to identify the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, for two different reactions. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding two main concepts:\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** The two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, react with different functional groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** How the chemical transformation affects the R/S designation of the chiral center.\n\n### **2. Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Careful Point 2: Stereochemical Analysis using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). This means the absolute 3D arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The chiral center (C3) is attached to:\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest Priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second Priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P3)**\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest Priority)\n    *(The ester arm is higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), which has a higher atomic number than the hydrogen it's attached to in the acid.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The chiral center (C4) is attached to:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest Priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second Priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P'3)**\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest Priority)\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (P1 in the start) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment in the product (P'2).\n    *   The acid arm (P2 in the start) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the product (P'1).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). A swap of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (P1 in the start) is untouched and becomes the carbonyl fragment in the product (P'1).\n    *   The acid arm (P2 in the start) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment in the product (P'2).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are maintained (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials must be the same enantiomer:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis for each reaction: first, determining which functional group reacts (chemoselectivity), and second, determining how this reaction affects the stereochemical designation (R/S) of the chiral center.\n\n### **Step 1: Foundational Principles**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n2.  **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone. The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the product.\n3.  **Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n4.  **Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules):** The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n### **Step 2: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nWe must determine the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center in both the starting material and the product.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P3)\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P4)\n    *(Reasoning: The ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because its oxygen is attached to a carbon (isobutyl group), which has a higher atomic number than the hydrogen the acid's oxygen is attached to.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P'3)\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P'4)\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The starting ester arm (P1) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment of the lactone (P'2).\n    *   The starting acid arm (P2) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl fragment of the lactone (P'1).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The starting ester arm (P1) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl fragment of the lactone (P'1).\n    *   The starting acid arm (P2) is reduced and becomes the ether fragment of the lactone (P'2).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **retained** (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the same enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving the specific reactivity of different reducing agents and a careful examination of stereochemical nomenclature.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity (Chemoselectivity)**: The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a relatively mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, preferentially reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**: The reactions do not alter the absolute three-dimensional arrangement of atoms at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking of the groups attached to this center.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material**: The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are -H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), an acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and an ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`). Comparing the two main arms, the ester arm has higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group) rather than a hydrogen.\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone)**: The chiral center is now part of a ring. The two ring fragments attached to it are `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the carbonyl side) and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the ether oxygen side). The carbonyl-containing fragment has higher priority.\n        *   Priority 1': `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`\n        *   Priority 2': `-CH₂-CH₂-O-`\n\n3.  **Trace Reaction A**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone`\n    *   **Pathway**: LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   **Priority Mapping**: The starting Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes the Priority 2' group (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`) in the product. The starting Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is not reduced and becomes the Priority 1' group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) in the product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A single swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product through inversion, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction B**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-lactone`\n    *   **Pathway**: BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   **Priority Mapping**: The starting Priority 1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is not reduced and becomes the Priority 1' group (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) in the product. The starting Priority 2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced and becomes the Priority 2' group (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`) in the product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The priority order of the groups is maintained. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product through retention, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material:\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis conclusion matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions is necessary, focusing on two key principles: the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).

Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the stereochemistry of two starting materials, A and B, based on the stereochemistry of the products they form after reacting with specific reducing agents. This requires understanding three key concepts:\n*   The structure of the starting material and product.\n*   The chemoselectivity of the reducing agents (`LiBH₄` and `BH₃`).\n*   The effect of the chemical transformation on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, which determine the R/S designation.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis is the first critical point. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two reducible groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **`LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols but does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **`BH₃` (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity, readily reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols while being much slower to react with esters.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Stereochemistry (CIP Priorities)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material), so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest Priority (P1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second Priority (P2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P3)**\n    4.  `-H` - **Lowest Priority (P4)**\n    *(The ester arm is higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (from the isobutyl group) versus a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest Priority (P'1)**\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second Priority (P'2)**\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - **Third Priority (P'3)**\n    4.  `-H` - **Lowest Priority (P'4)**\n\n### **4. Tracing Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group (P1 in the starting material). This group becomes the ether part of the lactone ring (P'2 in the product).

Analyze the Core Chemistry**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a lactone). This is formed by reducing one of the carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes with the other carbonyl group.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** This is the first critical point.\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)** selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane)** selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThis is the second critical point. The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon (C3) are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest priority (P1)**. The ester is higher priority than the acid because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen.\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second priority (P2)**.\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P3).\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P4).\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral carbon (C4) are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest priority (P'1)**.\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second priority (P'2)**.\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P'3).\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P'4).\n\n### **3. Trace Each Reaction Path**\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (original **P1**) is reduced and becomes the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (new **P'2**).\n    *   The acid arm (original **P2**) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (new **P'1**).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). Swapping two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n2.  **Transformation of Groups:**\n    *   The ester arm (original **P1**) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (new **P'1**).\n    *   The acid arm (original **P2**) is reduced and becomes the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (new **P'2**).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **preserved** (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reagents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reducing agents used have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones. It does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids. It is much less reactive towards esters.\n\nTherefore:\n*   In Reaction A, LiBH₄ will reduce the **ester** group.\n*   In Reaction B, BH₃ will reduce the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester arm) - **Highest priority (P1)** because the chain continues with -O-C, which outranks the -O-H of the acid.\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid arm) - **Second priority (P2)**.\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P3).\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P4).\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The chiral center (now C4) is part of a ring. The groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - **Highest priority (P'1)**.\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - **Second priority (P'2)**.\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority (P'3).\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority (P'4).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The ester arm (original **P1**) is reduced and becomes the lower-priority ring fragment (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, new **P'2**).\n    *   The acid arm (original **P2**) is not reduced and becomes the higher-priority ring fragment (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`, new **P'1**).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). A swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The ester arm (original **P1**) is not reduced and becomes the higher-priority ring fragment (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`, new **P'1**).\n    *   The acid arm (original **P2**) is reduced and becomes the lower-priority ring fragment (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, new **P'2**).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **retained** (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). This means the R/S designation is also **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.
