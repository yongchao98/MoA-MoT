    # Step 1: Simplify the non-Gaussianity (nG) measure.
    # The question defines nG = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau)).
    # This is equivalent to S(tau) - S(rho), where S is the von Neumann entropy.
    # The state |psi> is a pure state, so its entropy S(rho) is 0.
    # Therefore, nG = S(tau), the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the moments of the cat state to define the reference state tau.
    # For phi = -pi/4, the state is an "odd cat state".
    # The first moment (displacement) <a> is 0.
    # The second moments are <a^2> and <n> = <a†a>.

    nu = np.sqrt(nu_squared)

    # Step 4: Calculate the entropy S(tau) from the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu'.
    # The formula is S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)

    # In that case, the entropy is 0. We handle this to avoid log(0) errors.
