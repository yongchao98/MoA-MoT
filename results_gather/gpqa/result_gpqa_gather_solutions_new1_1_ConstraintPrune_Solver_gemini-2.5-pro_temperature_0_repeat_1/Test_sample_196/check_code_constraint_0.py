    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

    ### **Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material, Compound X.**

    This step requires a careful interpretation of the provided spectroscopic data (IR and ¹H NMR).

    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**
        *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.
        *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.
        *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.
        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.

    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**
        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, significantly downfield, confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is definitive for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other, electron-donating, substituent.
        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**
            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).
            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).
            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both the methyl at 0.9 ppm and the methine at 2.9 ppm.
            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic position), which explains its downfield shift. It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.
        *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments combine to form a `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.

    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

    ### **Step 2: Analyze the chemical reaction.**

    The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).

    *   **Reagents and Function:** The combination of red P and HI is a powerful reducing agent. Its specific and well-known function in organic chemistry is the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding methyl groups (-CH₃).
    *   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo the reduction of its carboxylic acid group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl substituent are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.

    ### **Step 3: Determine the final product.**

    Applying the transformation from Step 2 to the starting material from Step 1:

    *   The **-COOH** group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted to a **-CH₃** group.
    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

    ### **Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**

    Now, we compare our derived product with the list of possible answers.

    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.
    *   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - **This matches our derived final product.**
    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.
    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not its isomer isobutyl. No rearrangement is expected.

    **Conclusion:** The analysis of the spectral data correctly identifies the starting material, and knowledge of the specific chemical reaction correctly predicts the final product. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
