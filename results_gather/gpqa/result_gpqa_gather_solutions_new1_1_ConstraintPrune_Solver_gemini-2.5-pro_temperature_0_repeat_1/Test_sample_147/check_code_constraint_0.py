    # 2. Replicate the core logic of the provided reasoning
    # The reasoning's central argument is that the 1:1 comproportionation reaction
    # `Y + A4 -> A5` is the most restrictive clue and points to Krypton.
    # The specific reaction is `Kr + KrF4 -> 2KrF2`.

    # From this reaction, the identities are deduced:
    Y_element = 'Kr'
