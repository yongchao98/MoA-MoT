    Checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio question.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).

    Combining these, we get the relationship between temperature and period:
    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).

    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P4/P2)^(-1/3), which is equivalent to (P2/P4)^(1/3).
