        'A': "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",
        'B': "SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.",
        'C': "SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.",
        'D': "The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates."

        'C': {'is_correct': False, 'error_severity': 10, 'reason': "This statement contains a fundamental contradiction. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is an exoribonuclease, meaning its function is to *cause* the breakdown (cleavage) of RNA for proofreading. Stating it *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is the direct opposite of its biochemical role."},
        'D': {'is_correct': False, 'error_severity': 7, 'reason': "This statement contains specific factual errors. The correlation is not established as 'linear', and biophysical studies show the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot has a three-state unfolding pathway, not two. However, this is an error in specific detail rather than a complete reversal of function."}
