    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the chemistry question.
    It does this by:
    1. Defining the multiple-choice options provided in the question.
    2. Establishing the correct names for compounds A, B, and C based on chemical principles.
    3. Comparing the provided answer's claims against the correct compound names.
    4. Returning "Correct" if the answer is right, or a detailed reason if it's wrong.
