def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given quantum mechanics question.

    The question asks for the geometrical position (Bloch vector r) of the density matrix:
    rho = 1/2 * (|0><0| + |1><1|)

    The final answer provided is 'C', which corresponds to r = (0,0,0).
    This function will:
    1. Construct the density matrix rho from the question's definition.
    2. Calculate the corresponding Bloch vector r_calculated using the formula r_k = Tr(sigma_k * rho).
    3. Check if r_calculated matches the vector for the provided answer 'C'.
    4. Check if the vector for the provided answer 'C' is physically valid (length <= 1).
