def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the astrophysics question.
    It follows the logical steps:
    1. Calculate the cosmological redshift (z) from the given distance.
    2. Calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest) of the absorption line.
    3. Compare E_rest to the known energy of the 21-cm hydrogen line to identify the transition.
    4. Use the fact that it's an "absorption" line to determine the state (cold vs. warm) of the medium.
    5. Compare the derived correct answer with the provided answer.
