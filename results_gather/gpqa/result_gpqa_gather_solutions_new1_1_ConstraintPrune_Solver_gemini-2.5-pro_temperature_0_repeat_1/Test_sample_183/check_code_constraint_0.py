    # complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.
    is_D_flawed = True
    reason_D = "Option D is incorrect. It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (formed in step ii). This reaction is not viable as the Lewis acid catalyst deactivates the ring by reacting with the basic amino group."

    # Check Option C for logical reaction order.
    # Sequence: iv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) before viii) Reduction (Fe/HCl).
    # Rule: Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine, which is only formed after reduction.
    is_C_flawed = True
    reason_C = "Option C is incorrect. It has an impossible reaction order, attempting diazotization (step iv) before the amine is formed via reduction (step viii)."

    # Check Option B for correct regiochemical outcome.
    # Sequence: i) Alkylation, ii) Nitration.
    # Rule: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives the para-isomer as the major product due to sterics.
    # This 1,4-substitution pattern cannot lead to the target 1,2,3-pattern in high yield.
    is_B_flawed = True
    reason_B = "Option B is incorrect. The initial nitration of tert-butylbenzene (step ii) predominantly yields the para-isomer. Starting with this 1,4-disubstituted intermediate makes it impossible to achieve the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the target molecule in high yield."

    # iv) Reduction -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid
    # v) Diazotization -> 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid
    # vi) Second Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (highly specific)
    # vii/viii) Hydrolysis + Desulfonation -> 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol
    # ix) Etherification -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (correct final product after IUPAC naming)

    # to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern.
