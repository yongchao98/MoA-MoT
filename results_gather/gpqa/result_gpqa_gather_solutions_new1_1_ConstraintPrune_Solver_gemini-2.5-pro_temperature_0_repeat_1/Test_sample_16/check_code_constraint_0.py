    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the given chemistry problem.

    The problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA solution.
    K_f = 5x10^10.

    The equilibrium is [Ca-EDTA] <-> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-
    Let x = [Ca^2+] at equilibrium.
    Then [EDTA^4-] = x and [[Ca-EDTA]] = 0.02 - x.

    The formation constant K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).
    So, K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2.

    Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.
    K_f ≈ 0.02 / x^2
    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / K_f
    x = sqrt(0.02 / K_f)
