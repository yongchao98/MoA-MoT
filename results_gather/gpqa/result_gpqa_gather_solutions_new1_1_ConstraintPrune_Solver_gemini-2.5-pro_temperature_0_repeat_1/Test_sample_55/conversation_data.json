It found that all four paths are physically allowed.\n        *   Transition 1: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'>. Here, l changes from 0 to 1 (Δl = +1), which is allowed. m changes from 0 to m' (Δm = m'), which is allowed for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n        *   Transition 2: |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. Here, l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl = -1), which is allowed. m changes from m' to 0 (Δm = -m'), which is allowed for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n        *   So, the script's conclusion that all paths are allowed is correct.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Probability):** The script calculated the theoretical probability for any single decay path. Since the initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0), the decay to the three possible intermediate sub-levels (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) occurs with equal probability. The total probability must be 1, so each path has a probability of 1/3. The script correctly identifies this theoretical probability as 1/3 (or ~0.3333).\n    *   **Comparison:** The script then compared the probability of each hypothesis with the theoretical value.\n        *   A (1/4) and C (1/4) were rejected.\n        *   B (2/3) was rejected.\n        *   D (1/3) was accepted.\n    *   **Final Choice:** The script correctly identified 'D' as the only surviving candidate.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the summary:**\n    *   Start by stating the problem: finding the correct decay path and probability for the H-atom transition |3,0,0> -> |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions.\n    *   Explain the first filter: the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1). Mention that all proposed paths in the options (A, B, C, D) satisfy these rules, as confirmed by the code output.\n    *   Explain the second filter: the probability or branching ratio. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Therefore, the transition to the three possible intermediate p-sublevels (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) must occur with equal probability. Since there are three such paths, the probability for any single specific path is 1/3.\n    *   Conclude by comparing the options to this required probability. Options A and C propose 1/4, and option B proposes 2/3, all of which are incorrect. Option D proposes the correct path |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> with the correct probability of 1/3.\n    *   The code's output aligns perfectly with this physical reasoning, selecting D as the final answer.\n\n3.  **Format the final answer:**\n    *   Write the summary.\n    *   End with `<<<D>>>`.\nThe Python script successfully solved the problem by systematically applying physical constraints to the given hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: The first constraint applied was the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1). The script correctly determined that all proposed transition paths (|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0> for m' = -1, 0, 1) are physically allowed, as each step satisfies these rules.\n\n2.  **Probability (Branching Ratio)**: The second constraint was the probability of a specific decay path. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, the decay to the three possible intermediate p-sublevels (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) occurs with equal probability. Since these are the only three possible intermediate states, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The script filtered the candidates based on this theoretical probability. It found that options A and C (with probability 1/4) and option B (with probability 2/3) were incorrect. Only option D, which proposed a valid path and the correct probability of 1/3, survived the filtering process.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state occurs via the emission of photons. In the non-relativistic theory, the most probable transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state of the hydrogen atom is given as |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩, and the final state is the ground state |1, 0, 0⟩. The decay is stated to occur via two dipole transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n\nApplying the selection rules to the initial state:\n*   Since l = 0, the change in the orbital quantum number must be Δl = +1. Therefore, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since m = 0, the change in the magnetic quantum number can be Δm = 0, ±1. This means the possible values for m' are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nFor a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease (n' < n). Given the options, the intermediate state has n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, 0⟩, |2, 1, 1⟩, and |2, 1, -1⟩.\n\n**Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n\nNow, we consider the transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩:\n*   The change in the orbital quantum number is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', depends on the intermediate state:\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 0⟩, then Δm = 0, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 1⟩, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, -1⟩, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n1.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n2.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n3.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n\n**Transition Probabilities**\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3, 0, 0⟩ state, the probabilities of transitioning to any of the |2, 1, m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. This means that each of the three possible decay paths has an equal probability. Since there are three possible routes, the probability for any single route is 1/3.\n\nThe transition route mentioned in options A and B is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe probability for this specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) suggests a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n*   B) suggests a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   C) and D) suggest a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for other valid routes, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a lower energy state via an electric dipole transition is governed by specific selection rules. These rules dictate the allowed changes in the quantum numbers $l$ and $m$.\n\n### 1. Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\n\nFor an electric dipole transition to occur, the following selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, and the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be satisfied:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease for a decay ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Two-Step Transition\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{intermediate} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{intermediate} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, so the most probable intermediate state will have $n_{intermediate} = 2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states $|2,1,m_{intermediate}\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m_{intermediate}$. This is allowed if $m_{intermediate}$ is $0, \\pm 1$, which it is.\n*   Thus, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Determining the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the specific transition route and its corresponding probability. We need to determine the likelihood of the atom taking each of the three possible paths.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Because of this symmetry, the decay from the spherically symmetric $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the three degenerate sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state ($m=-1, 0, 1$) must occur with equal probability.\n*   The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1. Therefore, the probability of the decay proceeding through any single one of these intermediate states is:\n    $P(\\text{path}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of available paths}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   This means the probability for the atom to follow the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, via $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nOption D correctly identifies a valid transition route and assigns the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ based on the symmetry of the initial state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):**  Δl = ±1.\n2.  **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = 0, ±1.\n3.  **Change in principal quantum number (n):** There is no specific rule for Δn, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the final n must be smaller than the initial n.\n\nLet's analyze the two-step transition from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\n*   **Initial state:** n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1  ⇒  l' = 1.\n    *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1  ⇒  m' = 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   n' must be less than 3. For a two-step decay to n=1, the intermediate state will have n'=2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final state:** n=1, l=0, m=0.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   From |2,1,0⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n    *   From |2,1,1⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n    *   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three pathways are permitted by the selection rules. The options provided in the question list valid decay routes.\n\n**Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external polarizing field, the decay to each of the possible `m'` states of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ level is equally probable. Since there are three possible intermediate states (m' = -1, 0, 1), the probability of the atom decaying through any single one of these channels is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct route and probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We need to find a valid decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atomic transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to the rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number, $n$, can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n$ is unrestricted), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:** The atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l=0$. So, $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $m=0$. So, $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_k < n_i$:** The initial state has $n_i=3$. So, the intermediate state must have $n_k < 3$. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n_k=2$.\n    *   **Possible Intermediate States:** Based on the selection rules and the options, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if this is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$.\n        *   If $m_k = -1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. (Allowed)\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all the routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal.\n        Since there are 3 equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_k = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        We need to find the branching ratio for this decay. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$. Let's find all possible decay channels for $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l_f = 0$ or $l_f = 2$.\n        *   The rule $n_f < n_k=2$ means $n_f$ must be 1.\n        *   A state with $n=1$ must have $l=0$ (the 1s state). A state with $l=2$ requires $n \\ge 3$.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible final state for a decay from the $n=2, l=1$ level is the $n=1, l=0$ level.\n        *   This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it is guaranteed to decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The branching ratio is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe only option that provides a valid route with the correct probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe problem asks for the correct decay route and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Path\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$. For a transition to be allowed, the changes in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n1.  $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe spin quantum number $m_s$ does not change in these transitions.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a 3s orbital.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   Since the initial orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = l+1 = 1$. This corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number $m$ is initially 0. The intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   The problem specifies that the intermediate state is in the $n'=2$ shell. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a 1s orbital.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules from the intermediate states:**\n    *   The intermediate state has $l'=1$. The final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m'' - m' = 0 - m'$, must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($0, 1, -1$).\n\nThus, all three potential routes are valid according to the selection rules:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Analysis of the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching fraction for the first step of the decay.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction. Consequently, the transition probabilities to each of the possible magnetic sublevels of the final state are equal.\n\nIn this case, the atom decays from the 3s state ($l=0$) to one of the three 2p sublevels ($l=1$, with $m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since these three final states are equally probable, the total probability of the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is split equally among them.\n\n*   Total number of possible intermediate states = $2l'+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n*   Probability of transitioning to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe second transition, from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only allowed dipole decay channel for the 2p state. Therefore, once the atom is in the 2p state, it will decay to the 1s state with a probability of 1.\n\nThe overall probability of the two-step cascade proceeding via a specific intermediate state is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.

Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. This decay happens not in a single step, but via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole transition. We need to find a valid intermediate state that forms a possible decay path and calculate the probability of the atom taking that specific path.\n\n### 2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers |n, l, m>:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number change is not restricted (but must decrease for emission).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>. The decay path is |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the final l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, the final m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   Applying Δn: n must decrease. Since it's a two-step process to reach n=1, the intermediate state must have n' < 3. The most likely transition is to the nearest available level, which is n'=2. So, n'=2.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2, 1, 0>\n*   |2, 1, 1>\n*   |2, 1, -1>\n\n**Second transition: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if our possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   Final state: n''=1, l''=0, m''=0.\n*   For all three intermediate states (|2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>), we have n'=2, l'=1.\n*   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'.\n    *   If m'=0, Δm=0. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=1, Δm=-1. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=-1, Δm=+1. (Allowed)\n\nSo, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade (a sequence of decays) is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\nP(route) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2)\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThe branching ratio is the probability of a specific decay channel compared to all possible decay channels. A state |2,1,m'> (a 2p state) can only decay to a lower energy level. The only lower energy level is n=1. For n=1, the only possible value for l is l=0. Thus, the only possible final state via a single-photon dipole transition is |1,0,0>. Since this is the only possible decay route, its branching ratio is 1.\n*   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific state |2,1,m'> is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total decay rate of the initial state |3,0,0>.\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Rate_total(|3,0,0>)\n\nThe dominant decay channel for the |3,0,0> (3s) state is to the |2,1,m'> (2p) states. Other decays, like the two-photon decay to 1s, are much slower and can be neglected.\n*   Rate_total(|3,0,0>) ≈ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. A key physical principle is that an initial state with l=0 (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when it decays by emitting a photon, the emission must be isotropic on average, meaning it has no preference for which m' sublevel to populate. This implies that the transition rates to each of the possible final m' states must be equal.\n*   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nLet's call this rate `R`. Then the total rate is `R + R + R = 3R`.\nThe branching ratio for the decay to any specific m' state is:\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = R / (3R) = 1/3\n\nThis can be formally verified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which show that the angular part of the transition matrix element has the same magnitude for all three final m' states when the initial state has l=0.\n\n**Total Probability for each Route**\nNow we can calculate the total probability for each of the three possible routes:\n*   P(route via m'=0) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=-1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3).\n*   B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3).\n*   C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3. (The route is valid, and the probability is correct).\n*   D) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for a specific decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The process is a two-step radiative decay (cascade) governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   For decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n        *   **n-selection:** The energy must decrease, so $n_i < 3$. The intermediate state must also be able to decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so its energy must be higher than the ground state, meaning $n_i > 1$. The only possible integer value is $n_i = 2$.\n        *   **l-selection:** The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires that the intermediate state has $l_i = 1$.\n        *   **m-selection:** The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means $m_i - 0 = m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states.\n        *   **l-selection:** The initial state has $l_i=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   **m-selection:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed as long as $-m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible $m_i$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   All three paths through the intermediate $n=2, l=1$ level are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of the Specific Route:**\n    We need to find the probability of the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. This probability is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step: $P_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Therefore, the atom will decay into the three degenerate magnetic substates of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ level with equal probability.\n        The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) + W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) + W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        Due to the spherical symmetry, the rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        The branching ratio for the decay into any one of these specific states is the rate for that channel divided by the total rate.\n        $P_1 = \\frac{W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{W_{total}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step: $P_2 = P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n        The state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an electric dipole transition. There are no other lower-energy states it can decay to. Therefore, this transition occurs with 100% certainty once the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state.\n        $P_2 = 1$\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the specified cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n        $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine a valid decay path for a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions, and to calculate the probability of that specific path.\n\n**1. Plan**\n*   First, I will establish the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\n*   Next, I will apply these rules to identify the possible intermediate states that connect the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Then, I will calculate the relative probabilities (branching ratios) for the decay from the initial state to each of the possible intermediate states.\n*   Finally, I will determine the probability of the entire two-step process for each path and compare it with the given options.\n\n**2. Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Selection Rules and Intermediate States**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$).\n\n    The decay process is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n        *   For a decay cascade, the energy must decrease at each step, so $1 \\le n' < 3$. The intermediate state must be able to decay to $n=1$, so $n' > 1$. This leaves $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Let's check if the transition from the intermediate states is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, $\\Delta m$ will be in $\\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, which also satisfies the rule.\n        *   Thus, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Transition Probabilities**\n    The probability of a specific decay path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state).\n\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to find the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The rate is given by:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (since $l=0$), there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$\n    Here, the initial state is $|l,m\\rangle = |0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|l',m'\\rangle = |1,m'\\rangle$.\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero only if $m+q=m'$, which means $q=m'$. So for each $m'$, only one term in the sum contributes.\n    *   For $m' = 0$: $\\Gamma(0) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = 1$: $\\Gamma(1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = -1$: $\\Gamma(-1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n\n    The rates are indeed equal: $\\Gamma(0) : \\Gamma(1) : \\Gamma(-1) = 1:1:1$.\n\n    The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of these rates: $\\Gamma_{total} \\propto 1+1+1=3$.\n    The probability (branching ratio) of decaying via a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Comparison**\n    The probability for any of the three possible routes is $1/3$.

For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  The orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n2.  The magnetic quantum number, *m*, must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\nThe transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ cannot occur directly in a single dipole transition because Δ*l* = 0, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, it must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state**\n\n*   **Initial state:** |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, the intermediate state must have *l*' = 1.\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*m* = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have *m*' = 0, 1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.

This corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. Because there is no preferred direction in space, the probability of transitioning to any of the three magnetic sublevels (*m*' = -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1⟩ state is equal.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) The path is correct, but the probability is 2/3.

Calculating the Transition Probability:**\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to any of the three possible m' sublevels of the l'=1 state is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is the sum of the probabilities to each of the m' states. Since these probabilities are equal, the probability for any one specific path is 1/3.\n\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate |2,1,m'> states, it must decay to the |1,0,0> state to complete the two-step transition to the ground state. The transition from any |2,1,m'> state to |1,0,0> is an allowed transition, and it is the only possible dipole transition to the n=1 shell. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1, conditioned on the first step having occurred.\n\nThe overall probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\nB) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{3} (Correct route and probability)\nC) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\nD) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{2}{3} (Malformed and incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via electric dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δ*l* = ±1\n*   Δ*m* = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state is |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and the final state is |1,0,0⟩. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which we can denote as |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩. Since the energy must decrease at each step, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   According to the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, so *n'* must be less than 3. A transition to *n'*=2 is possible.\n*   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number *m* is Δ*m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the possible values for *m'* are 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n\n*   From |2,1,0⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules.\n\nThe probability of the atom taking any one of these specific paths depends on the transition rates. For the initial transition from the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state, the transition rates to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. Since there are three possible, equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability of decaying through any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - This is a valid route with the correct probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option A correctly identifies one of the possible transition routes and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user has confirmed the output is correct. The code successfully applied the constraints and identified the correct option.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: All proposed paths are valid according to the electric dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n2.  **Branching Ratios**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the transition rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final $l'=1$ state are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m'\\rangle^2$. For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, these coefficients are equal for all possible final $m'$ states. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$ states.\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: Since there are three equally likely decay channels from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ manifold, the probability for each is $1/3$. The subsequent decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, so its probability is 1. The total probability of the cascade is therefore the probability of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to identify the correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through a two-step dipole process.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   The electric dipole transition selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n    *   Starting from |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0), the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate principal quantum number is n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   From any of the |2,1,m'> states, a transition to |1,0,0> is possible.\n    *   For l=1 to l=0, Δl = -1 (allowed).\n    *   For m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1} to m=0, Δm is ∈ {1, 0, -1} (allowed).\n    *   Since spontaneous emission requires the principal quantum number to decrease, the transition from n=2 to n=1 is the only possible decay path from the |2,1,m'> states. Therefore, the probability of this second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1 for any of the allowed intermediate states.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n    *   According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, for a transition from a state with l=0, the transition probabilities to the different m' sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   This means the probabilities for the transitions |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>, |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>, and |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> are identical.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible intermediate states in the n=2, l=1 manifold, they must share the total probability equally. The branching ratio for each is 1/3.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of the specific route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(route) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Skeptic:** The reasoning seems sound, but the existence of option B with a probability of 2/3 for the same path is concerning. It suggests there might be a nuance missed. For transitions between states with l ≠ 0, the probabilities for different Δm transitions are not always equal and can depend on factors like polarization. However, for a transition *from* an l=0 state, the spherical symmetry should guarantee equal probabilities for each final m' state, assuming no external fields and that we are averaging over all emission directions. The calculation of 1/3 seems robust. The 2/3 value might arise from a misunderstanding of the question or a non-standard context. A search to confirm the branching ratios for the 3s → 2p transition in hydrogen is a prudent step to verify the theoretical conclusion.\n\n**Decision:** The theoretical argument strongly supports a 1/3 probability for each of the three possible decay paths. I will proceed with a search to confirm this and rule out any alternative interpretations that could lead to a 2/3 probability.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial analysis concluded that the decay of the |3,0,0> state proceeds with equal probability through the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This is based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state (l=0), the transition probabilities to the different magnetic sublevels (m') of a given l' state are identical. The subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'> state to the |1,0,0> ground state has a probability of 1, as it is the only allowed decay channel. Therefore, the probability for any specific route, such as |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, is the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n**Skeptic:** The theoretical argument is sound, but it's crucial to confirm it, especially since an option with a 2/3 probability exists. The search results should be examined for any information that contradicts this 1/3 probability conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results:**\n*   The search results confirm the standard dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n*   They also confirm that for a transition to occur, the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states must be non-zero.\n*   One source directly addresses the question of symmetry for this exact problem. It confirms that the probability for the electron to take each of the three routes (|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>, |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) is 1/3. It explicitly states that this is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the angular part of the transition probability, are the same for all three |3,0,0>→|2,1,m'> transitions.\n*   Another source, while discussing the 2P→1S transition, notes that the transition rate is independent of the magnetic quantum number m, which is a general result. This supports the conclusion that the decay rates from |3,0,0> to each of the |2,1,m'> states are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial theoretical analysis is strongly supported by the search results, particularly by a source that directly analyzes the same problem. The probability of the cascade proceeding through any single |2,1,m'> state is 1/3. The path specified in options B and D is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and its calculated probability is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe core task is to identify a valid decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Selection Rules and Possible Intermediate States**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the electric dipole (E1) selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\nApplying these rules to the first transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   Since $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires that the intermediate state has $l'=1$.\n    *   Since $m=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the decay is a two-step cascade to $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** There is a strong consensus among all agents that the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate the Second Transition**\nThe second transition is from one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Change in m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways (via $m'=-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$) are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Careful Point: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThis is the critical step where the options differ. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Therefore, the probability of this step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a *specific* intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   A vast majority of the agents correctly identified the key physical principle: the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital and is **spherically symmetric**.\n    *   Due to this symmetry (and in the absence of external fields), there is no preferred direction for the decay. The atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sub-levels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, any valid decay path has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's evaluate the options presented in the original prompt:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   Assuming the typo means the path is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nOnly option B presents a physically correct statement. The confusion among the candidate answers regarding the final letter (A, B, C, or D) stems from inconsistent parsing of the original question's options. However, the physical reasoning consistently points to a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for any of the valid paths. Based on the options provided in the prompt, B is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"

It found that all four paths are physically allowed.\n        *   Transition 1: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'>. Here, l changes from 0 to 1 (Δl = +1), which is allowed. m changes from 0 to m' (Δm = m'), which is allowed for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n        *   Transition 2: |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. Here, l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl = -1), which is allowed. m changes from m' to 0 (Δm = -m'), which is allowed for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n        *   So, the script's conclusion that all paths are allowed is correct.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Probability):** The script calculated the theoretical probability for any single decay path. Since the initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0), the decay to the three possible intermediate sub-levels (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) occurs with equal probability. The total probability must be 1, so each path has a probability of 1/3.

The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Therefore, the transition to the three possible intermediate p-sublevels (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) must occur with equal probability. Since there are three such paths, the probability for any single specific path is 1/3.\n    *   Conclude by comparing the options to this required probability. Options A and C propose 1/4, and option B proposes 2/3, all of which are incorrect. Option D proposes the correct path |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> with the correct probability of 1/3.\n    *   The code's output aligns perfectly with this physical reasoning, selecting D as the final answer.\n\n3.  **Format the final answer:**\n    *   Write the summary.\n    *   End with `<<<D>>>`.\nThe Python script successfully solved the problem by systematically applying physical constraints to the given hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: The first constraint applied was the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1). The script correctly determined that all proposed transition paths (|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0> for m' = -1, 0, 1) are physically allowed, as each step satisfies these rules.\n\n2.  **Probability (Branching Ratio)**: The second constraint was the probability of a specific decay path. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, the decay to the three possible intermediate p-sublevels (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) occurs with equal probability. Since these are the only three possible intermediate states, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The script filtered the candidates based on this theoretical probability. It found that options A and C (with probability 1/4) and option B (with probability 2/3) were incorrect. Only option D, which proposed a valid path and the correct probability of 1/3, survived the filtering process.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state occurs via the emission of photons. In the non-relativistic theory, the most probable transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state of the hydrogen atom is given as |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩, and the final state is the ground state |1, 0, 0⟩. The decay is stated to occur via two dipole transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n\nApplying the selection rules to the initial state:\n*   Since l = 0, the change in the orbital quantum number must be Δl = +1. Therefore, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since m = 0, the change in the magnetic quantum number can be Δm = 0, ±1. This means the possible values for m' are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nFor a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease (n' < n). Given the options, the intermediate state has n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, 0⟩, |2, 1, 1⟩, and |2, 1, -1⟩.\n\n**Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n\nNow, we consider the transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩:\n*   The change in the orbital quantum number is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', depends on the intermediate state:\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 0⟩, then Δm = 0, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 1⟩, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, -1⟩, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n1.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n2.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n3.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n\n**Transition Probabilities**\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3, 0, 0⟩ state, the probabilities of transitioning to any of the |2, 1, m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. This means that each of the three possible decay paths has an equal probability. Since there are three possible routes, the probability for any single route is 1/3.\n\nThe transition route mentioned in options A and B is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe probability for this specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) suggests a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n*   B) suggests a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   C) and D) suggest a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for other valid routes, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a lower energy state via an electric dipole transition is governed by specific selection rules.

Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\n\nFor an electric dipole transition to occur, the following selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, and the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be satisfied:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease for a decay ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Two-Step Transition\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{intermediate} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{intermediate} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, so the most probable intermediate state will have $n_{intermediate} = 2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states $|2,1,m_{intermediate}\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m_{intermediate}$. This is allowed if $m_{intermediate}$ is $0, \\pm 1$, which it is.\n*   Thus, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Determining the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the specific transition route and its corresponding probability. We need to determine the likelihood of the atom taking each of the three possible paths.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Because of this symmetry, the decay from the spherically symmetric $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the three degenerate sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state ($m=-1, 0, 1$) must occur with equal probability.\n*   The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1. Therefore, the probability of the decay proceeding through any single one of these intermediate states is:\n    $P(\\text{path}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of available paths}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   This means the probability for the atom to follow the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, via $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nOption D correctly identifies a valid transition route and assigns the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ based on the symmetry of the initial state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):**  Δl = ±1.\n2.  **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = 0, ±1.\n3.  **Change in principal quantum number (n):** There is no specific rule for Δn, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the final n must be smaller than the initial n.\n\nLet's analyze the two-step transition from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\n*   **Initial state:** n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1  ⇒  l' = 1.\n    *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1  ⇒  m' = 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   n' must be less than 3. For a two-step decay to n=1, the intermediate state will have n'=2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final state:** n=1, l=0, m=0.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   From |2,1,0⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n    *   From |2,1,1⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n    *   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three pathways are permitted by the selection rules. The options provided in the question list valid decay routes.\n\n**Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external polarizing field, the decay to each of the possible `m'` states of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ level is equally probable. Since there are three possible intermediate states (m' = -1, 0, 1), the probability of the atom decaying through any single one of these channels is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct route and probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We need to find a valid decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atomic transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to the rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number, $n$, can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n$ is unrestricted), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:** The atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l=0$. So, $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $m=0$. So, $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_k < n_i$:** The initial state has $n_i=3$. So, the intermediate state must have $n_k < 3$. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n_k=2$.\n    *   **Possible Intermediate States:** Based on the selection rules and the options, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if this is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$.\n        *   If $m_k = -1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 1$, $\\Delta m = -1$.

Therefore, all the routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal.\n        Since there are 3 equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_k = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        We need to find the branching ratio for this decay. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$. Let's find all possible decay channels for $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l_f = 0$ or $l_f = 2$.\n        *   The rule $n_f < n_k=2$ means $n_f$ must be 1.\n        *   A state with $n=1$ must have $l=0$ (the 1s state). A state with $l=2$ requires $n \\ge 3$.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible final state for a decay from the $n=2, l=1$ level is the $n=1, l=0$ level.\n        *   This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it is guaranteed to decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.

For a transition to be allowed, the changes in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n1.  $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe spin quantum number $m_s$ does not change in these transitions.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a 3s orbital.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   Since the initial orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = l+1 = 1$. This corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number $m$ is initially 0. The intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   The problem specifies that the intermediate state is in the $n'=2$ shell. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a 1s orbital.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules from the intermediate states:**\n    *   The intermediate state has $l'=1$. The final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m'' - m' = 0 - m'$, must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($0, 1, -1$).\n\nThus, all three potential routes are valid according to the selection rules:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Analysis of the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching fraction for the first step of the decay.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction. Consequently, the transition probabilities to each of the possible magnetic sublevels of the final state are equal.\n\nIn this case, the atom decays from the 3s state ($l=0$) to one of the three 2p sublevels ($l=1$, with $m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since these three final states are equally probable, the total probability of the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is split equally among them.\n\n*   Total number of possible intermediate states = $2l'+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n*   Probability of transitioning to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe second transition, from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only allowed dipole decay channel for the 2p state. Therefore, once the atom is in the 2p state, it will decay to the 1s state with a probability of 1.\n\nThe overall probability of the two-step cascade proceeding via a specific intermediate state is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. Each has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - **Correct path and probability.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. This decay happens not in a single step, but via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole transition. We need to find a valid intermediate state that forms a possible decay path and calculate the probability of the atom taking that specific path.\n\n### 2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers |n, l, m>:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number change is not restricted (but must decrease for emission).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>. The decay path is |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the final l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, the final m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   Applying Δn: n must decrease. Since it's a two-step process to reach n=1, the intermediate state must have n' < 3. The most likely transition is to the nearest available level, which is n'=2. So, n'=2.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2, 1, 0>\n*   |2, 1, 1>\n*   |2, 1, -1>\n\n**Second transition: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if our possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   Final state: n''=1, l''=0, m''=0.\n*   For all three intermediate states (|2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>), we have n'=2, l'=1.\n*   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'.\n    *   If m'=0, Δm=0. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=1, Δm=-1. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=-1, Δm=+1. (Allowed)\n\nSo, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade (a sequence of decays) is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\nP(route) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2)\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThe branching ratio is the probability of a specific decay channel compared to all possible decay channels. A state |2,1,m'> (a 2p state) can only decay to a lower energy level. The only lower energy level is n=1. For n=1, the only possible value for l is l=0. Thus, the only possible final state via a single-photon dipole transition is |1,0,0>. Since this is the only possible decay route, its branching ratio is 1.\n*   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific state |2,1,m'> is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total decay rate of the initial state |3,0,0>.\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Rate_total(|3,0,0>)\n\nThe dominant decay channel for the |3,0,0> (3s) state is to the |2,1,m'> (2p) states. Other decays, like the two-photon decay to 1s, are much slower and can be neglected.\n*   Rate_total(|3,0,0>) ≈ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. A key physical principle is that an initial state with l=0 (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when it decays by emitting a photon, the emission must be isotropic on average, meaning it has no preference for which m' sublevel to populate. This implies that the transition rates to each of the possible final m' states must be equal.\n*   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nLet's call this rate `R`. Then the total rate is `R + R + R = 3R`.\nThe branching ratio for the decay to any specific m' state is:\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = R / (3R) = 1/3\n\nThis can be formally verified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which show that the angular part of the transition matrix element has the same magnitude for all three final m' states when the initial state has l=0.\n\n**Total Probability for each Route**\nNow we can calculate the total probability for each of the three possible routes:\n*   P(route via m'=0) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=-1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.

The intermediate state must also be able to decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so its energy must be higher than the ground state, meaning $n_i > 1$. The only possible integer value is $n_i = 2$.\n        *   **l-selection:** The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires that the intermediate state has $l_i = 1$.\n        *   **m-selection:** The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means $m_i - 0 = m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states.\n        *   **l-selection:** The initial state has $l_i=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   **m-selection:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed as long as $-m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible $m_i$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   All three paths through the intermediate $n=2, l=1$ level are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of the Specific Route:**\n    We need to find the probability of the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. This probability is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step: $P_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Therefore, the atom will decay into the three degenerate magnetic substates of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ level with equal probability.\n        The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) + W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) + W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        Due to the spherical symmetry, the rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        The branching ratio for the decay into any one of these specific states is the rate for that channel divided by the total rate.\n        $P_1 = \\frac{W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{W_{total}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step: $P_2 = P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n        The state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an electric dipole transition. There are no other lower-energy states it can decay to. Therefore, this transition occurs with 100% certainty once the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state.\n        $P_2 = 1$\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the specified cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n        $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Selection Rules and Intermediate States**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$).\n\n    The decay process is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n        *   For a decay cascade, the energy must decrease at each step, so $1 \\le n' < 3$. The intermediate state must be able to decay to $n=1$, so $n' > 1$. This leaves $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Let's check if the transition from the intermediate states is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, $\\Delta m$ will be in $\\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, which also satisfies the rule.\n        *   Thus, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Transition Probabilities**\n    The probability of a specific decay path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state).\n\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to find the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The rate is given by:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (since $l=0$), there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$\n    Here, the initial state is $|l,m\\rangle = |0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|l',m'\\rangle = |1,m'\\rangle$.\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero only if $m+q=m'$, which means $q=m'$. So for each $m'$, only one term in the sum contributes.\n    *   For $m' = 0$: $\\Gamma(0) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = 1$: $\\Gamma(1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = -1$: $\\Gamma(-1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n\n    The rates are indeed equal: $\\Gamma(0) : \\Gamma(1) : \\Gamma(-1) = 1:1:1$.\n\n    The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of these rates: $\\Gamma_{total} \\propto 1+1+1=3$.\n    The probability (branching ratio) of decaying via a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Comparison**\n    The probability for any of the three possible routes is $1/3$.

For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  The orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n2.  The magnetic quantum number, *m*, must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\nThe transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ cannot occur directly in a single dipole transition because Δ*l* = 0, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, it must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state**\n\n*   **Initial state:** |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, the intermediate state must have *l*' = 1.\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*m* = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have *m*' = 0, 1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. The logical intermediate step is to *n*' = 2.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed:\n\n*   **Intermediate states:** |2,1,*m*'⟩\n*   **Final state:** |1,0,0⟩\n*   The change in *l* is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n*   The change in *m* from any of the *m*' = {0, 1, -1} to *m*'' = 0 is also allowed (Δ*m* = 0, -1, or 1).\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are possible:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Probability**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. Because there is no preferred direction in space, the probability of transitioning to any of the three magnetic sublevels (*m*' = -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1⟩ state is equal.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) The path is correct, but the probability is 2/3.

Analyzing the Decay Path:**\nThe atom starts in the state |3,0,0> and decays to |1,0,0> in two steps. Let the intermediate state be |n',l',m'>.\n\n*   **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, we must have l' = 1.\n        *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   n' < 3.

Calculating the Transition Probability:**\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to any of the three possible m' sublevels of the l'=1 state is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is the sum of the probabilities to each of the m' states.

The transition from any |2,1,m'> state to |1,0,0> is an allowed transition, and it is the only possible dipole transition to the n=1 shell.

The branching ratio for each is 1/3.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of the specific route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(route) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Skeptic:** The reasoning seems sound, but the existence of option B with a probability of 2/3 for the same path is concerning. It suggests there might be a nuance missed. For transitions between states with l ≠ 0, the probabilities for different Δm transitions are not always equal and can depend on factors like polarization. However, for a transition *from* an l=0 state, the spherical symmetry should guarantee equal probabilities for each final m' state, assuming no external fields and that we are averaging over all emission directions. The calculation of 1/3 seems robust. The 2/3 value might arise from a misunderstanding of the question or a non-standard context. A search to confirm the branching ratios for the 3s → 2p transition in hydrogen is a prudent step to verify the theoretical conclusion.\n\n**Decision:** The theoretical argument strongly supports a 1/3 probability for each of the three possible decay paths. I will proceed with a search to confirm this and rule out any alternative interpretations that could lead to a 2/3 probability.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial analysis concluded that the decay of the |3,0,0> state proceeds with equal probability through the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This is based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state (l=0), the transition probabilities to the different magnetic sublevels (m') of a given l' state are identical. The subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'> state to the |1,0,0> ground state has a probability of 1, as it is the only allowed decay channel. Therefore, the probability for any specific route, such as |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, is the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n**Skeptic:** The theoretical argument is sound, but it's crucial to confirm it, especially since an option with a 2/3 probability exists. The search results should be examined for any information that contradicts this 1/3 probability conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results:**\n*   The search results confirm the standard dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n*   They also confirm that for a transition to occur, the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states must be non-zero.\n*   One source directly addresses the question of symmetry for this exact problem. It confirms that the probability for the electron to take each of the three routes (|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>, |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) is 1/3. It explicitly states that this is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the angular part of the transition probability, are the same for all three |3,0,0>→|2,1,m'> transitions.\n*   Another source, while discussing the 2P→1S transition, notes that the transition rate is independent of the magnetic quantum number m, which is a general result. This supports the conclusion that the decay rates from |3,0,0> to each of the |2,1,m'> states are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial theoretical analysis is strongly supported by the search results, particularly by a source that directly analyzes the same problem. The probability of the cascade proceeding through any single |2,1,m'> state is 1/3. The path specified in options B and D is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and its calculated probability is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
