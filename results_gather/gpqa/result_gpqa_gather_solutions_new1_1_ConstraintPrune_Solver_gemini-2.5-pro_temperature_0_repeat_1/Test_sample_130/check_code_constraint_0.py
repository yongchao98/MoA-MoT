def check_diels_alder_noesy():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the Diels-Alder NOESY problem.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  Define the proton types and their expected NMR signals based on the problem description.
    2.  Define the answer options in terms of these proton types.
    3.  Establish the stereochemical rules for the reaction:
        a. A Diels-Alder reaction produces 'endo' and 'exo' products.
        b. Crucially, due to severe steric hindrance from the tetramethylated diene, the 'exo' product is major, reversing the usual Alder-endo rule.
    4.  Define the spatial proximities (< 5 Ã…) for both 'endo' and 'exo' isomers, which determine NOESY cross-peaks.
    5.  Identify the NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product ('exo') but absent in the minor product ('endo').
    6.  Determine which answer option corresponds to this unique cross-peak.
    7.  Compare the derived correct option with the provided answer ('C').
