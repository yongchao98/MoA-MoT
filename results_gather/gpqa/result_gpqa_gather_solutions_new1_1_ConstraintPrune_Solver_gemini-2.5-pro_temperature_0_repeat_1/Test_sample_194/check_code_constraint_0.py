    # The question asks for the maximum orbital period for Planet 2 to still have a transit.
    # A longer period means a larger semi-major axis 'a'.
    # The largest orbit that allows a transit is a "grazing" transit.
    # The standard, simplified model for this is when the center of the planet passes over the
    # star's limb, which corresponds to a maximum impact parameter of b2_max = 1.
    # This model is the most common for such problems and, as shown in the LLM answers,
    # leads directly to one of the options.
    b2_max = 1.0

    # --- Step 2: Relate the orbits of the two planets ---
    # The impact parameter 'b' is given by b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s.
    # Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their inclination 'i' is the same.
    # They orbit the same star, so the stellar radius 'R_s' is also the same.
    # Therefore, the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of their impact parameters:
    # a2 / a1 = b2 / b1
    # We are looking for the maximum semi-major axis for planet 2 (a2_max).
    a2_over_a1_max = b2_max / b1
