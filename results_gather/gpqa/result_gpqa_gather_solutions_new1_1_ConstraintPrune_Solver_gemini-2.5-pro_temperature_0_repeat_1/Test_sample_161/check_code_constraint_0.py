    """
    This function verifies the calculation of the area of a surface
    with the given metric ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) * (dx^2 + dy^2).
    It uses symbolic integration to find the area and compares it with the
    provided options.

    The question asks for the area, which must be a single, non-negative scalar value.
    - Option A: 4*pi*(x^2+y^2) - Not a scalar, depends on coordinates. Incorrect.
    - Option B: 4*pi*(x^2-y^2) - Not a scalar, depends on coordinates. Incorrect.
    - Option D: 0 - The area element is strictly positive over the domain, so the
      integral over a non-zero domain cannot be zero. Incorrect.
    This leaves Option C (+infinity) as the only plausible choice. This code will verify this through direct calculation.

    The final answer provided by the LLM is 'C'.
