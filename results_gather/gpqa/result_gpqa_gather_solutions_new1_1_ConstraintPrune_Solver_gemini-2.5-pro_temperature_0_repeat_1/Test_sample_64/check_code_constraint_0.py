    Checks the correctness of the answer to the organic chemistry question.

    The check is based on two main constraints derived from the reaction conditions:
    1. Reaction 1 is a rearrangement, so the product must be an isomer of the reactant (same molecular formula).
    2. Reaction 2 is performed under basic conditions with no acidic workup, so the product must be a salt, not a neutral acid.
