    Checks the correctness of the answer to the biological riddle.
    
    The riddle describes the secretory pathway:
    1.  Meeting Place: A "ribonucleoprotein particle" (SRP) meets a "nascent chain" (on a ribosome). This occurs in the cytosol.
    2.  Journey/Processing: Clues "sugar" (glycosylation) and "rough" (Rough ER) confirm the protein is entering the secretory pathway.
    3.  Destination: The protein is "on its way", and a primary destination for this pathway is secretion into the extracellular space.
