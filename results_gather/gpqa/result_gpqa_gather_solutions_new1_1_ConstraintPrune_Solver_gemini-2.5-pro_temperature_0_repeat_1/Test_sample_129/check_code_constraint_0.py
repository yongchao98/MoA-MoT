def check_quasar_redshift_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the quasar redshift problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line.
    2. Define the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. The analysis argues for a value
       around 3500 Å as the physical lower limit for detection, as opposed to a
       more practical limit around 4000 Å. We will use this assumption to check
       the consistency of the reasoning.
    3. For each option, calculate the observed wavelength.
    4. Identify all options that result in an observed wavelength greater than
       the atmospheric cutoff (i.e., are detectable).
    5. The correct answer must be the smallest redshift among these detectable options,
       as the question asks for the "lower limit".
    6. Compare this calculated correct answer with the provided answer.
