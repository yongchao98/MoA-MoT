def check_organic_synthesis_answer(llm_answer: str):
    """
    Checks the correctness of a proposed reaction sequence for the synthesis of
    [1,1'-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one from 1,5-dichloropentane.

    The overall strategy is:
    1,5-dichloropentane -> cyclopentane -> chlorocyclopentane -> cyclopentanol -> cyclopentanone -> final product

    Args:
        llm_answer: The letter ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'D') corresponding to the chosen answer.
