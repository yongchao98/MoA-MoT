    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable
    # hydrogen in the final product of a three-step synthesis.
    # The provided answer to check is 'C', which corresponds to 'triplet of triplets'.
    
    provided_answer_letter = 'C'

    # --- Step 1: Deduce the reaction pathway and final product ---
    
    # Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH/heat -> Product 1
    # Key info: IR at 1720 cm-1 means a ketone is formed. Harsh conditions on the
    # adamantane skeleton suggest a rearrangement. The known product is protoadamantan-4-one.
    # The provided NMR data is often considered a red herring in this classic problem.
    product_1 = "protoadamantan-4-one"

    # Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al(OiPr)3/heat -> Product 2
    # Key info: The next step is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond.
    # Therefore, the reaction is not just an MPV reduction (ketone->alcohol) but also
    # includes a subsequent heat-induced dehydration (alcohol->alkene).
    product_2 = "protoadamantene"

    # Reaction 3: Product 2 + O3/DMS -> Product 3
    # Key info: Reductive ozonolysis of protoadamantene (-CH=CH- unit).
    # This cleaves the double bond to form two aldehyde groups, opening one of the rings.
    product_3 = "bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde"

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3 ---

    # Identify the proton of interest: "most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange)"
    
    # Candidate A: Aldehyde protons (-CHO).
    # These are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons (delta ~9-10 ppm).
    # They are coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon (C3 or C7).
    # Expected pattern: Doublet.
    # Check against options: 'doublet' is not an option. This implies we must consider the next most deshielded proton.
    
    # Candidate B: Methine protons at C3 and C7 (alpha to the -CHO groups).
    # These are the next most deshielded protons on the carbon skeleton.
    
    # Analyze the coupling for H3/H7:
    # 1. Conformation: The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system adopts a stable dual-chair conformation.
    # 2. Stereochemistry: The bulky aldehyde groups occupy the more stable equatorial positions.
    #    This forces the H3 and H7 protons into the axial positions.
    # 3. Neighbors: An axial proton (H3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4).
    #    It has four neighbors: two axial protons (H2ax, H4ax) and two equatorial protons (H2eq, H4eq).
    # 4. Symmetry: Due to the molecule's C2 symmetry, the two axial neighbors are equivalent, and the two equatorial neighbors are equivalent.
    # 5. Coupling Constants: The axial-axial coupling (J_ax,ax) is large, while the axial-equatorial coupling (J_ax,eq) is small.
    # 6. Splitting Pattern:
    #    - The large coupling to the two equivalent axial protons (n=2) splits the signal into a triplet (n+1=3).
    #    - Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the small coupling to the two equivalent equatorial protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet (n+1=3).

            "4. In the stable conformation, these protons are axial and are coupled to two adjacent axial protons and two adjacent equatorial protons.\n"
