    Checks the correctness of the answer to the biological question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Identify the biological state: Yeast shmoo formation implies G1 cell cycle arrest.
    2. Identify the primary active process: Transcription for mating.
    3. Identify the inhibited process: DNA replication (S phase is blocked).
    4. The question asks for the LEAST observed complex in an ACTIVE chromatin assay.
    5. The least observed complex will be the one associated with the inhibited process.
