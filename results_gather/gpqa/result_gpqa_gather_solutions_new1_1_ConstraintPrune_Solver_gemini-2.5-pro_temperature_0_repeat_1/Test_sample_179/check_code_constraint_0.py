    Calculates the minimum potential energy of the system and verifies the provided answer.

    The system consists of 13 identical particles with charge 2e.
    - 1 charge is at the center of a sphere.
    - 12 charges are on the surface of the sphere with radius R=2m.

    The minimum energy configuration for the 12 charges on the sphere is an icosahedron
    (solution to the Thomson problem for N=12).

    The total energy is the sum of:
    1. U_cs: Interaction between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.
    2. U_ss: Mutual interaction among the 12 shell charges.
