    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the exoplanet transit probability problem.

    The problem asks to compare the transit probabilities of two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.
    The transit probability (p) is proportional to the stellar radius (R_s) divided by the planet's semi-major axis (a):
    p ∝ R_s / a

    From Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period (P) and stellar mass (M_s):
    a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)

    Combining these, the transit probability is:
    p ∝ R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)

    We need to find the ratio p1 / p2.

    # Given relationships from the problem statement:
    # 1. Stellar radii are equal: R_s1 = R_s2  => R_s1 / R_s2 = 1
    # 2. Mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 => M_s1 / M_s2 = 2
    # 3. Period of Planet 1 is 1/3 of Planet 2: P1 = P2 / 3 => P2 / P1 = 3

    # The ratio of probabilities p1 / p2 is:
    # ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    # Substituting the ratios:
    # ratio = (1) * [ (1 / (M_s1/M_s2)) * (P2/P1)^2 ]^(1/3)
    # ratio = [ (1 / 2) * (3)^2 ]^(1/3)
