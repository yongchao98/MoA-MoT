    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the nuclear decay problem.

    The problem asks to compare the energy spectrum of particle E in two decays:
    1. Original: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V
    2. Variant:  2A -> 2B + 2E + M

    Constraints from the problem statement:
    - V is a "much lighter particle", implying it has a non-zero rest mass (m_V > 0).
    - M is an "exotic, massless particle" (m_M = 0).
    - The original spectrum is continuous.

    The provided answer to check is 'A'.
    A) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
    B) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.
    C) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.
    D) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.
