    # The answer to check is 'B', which corresponds to 'c2h'.
    
    # --- Step 1: Nitration of Toluene ---
    # Toluene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Product 1
    # The methyl group is an ortho, para-director. The para product is major due to less steric hindrance.
    # Assumption: The major product is carried forward.

    # --- Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1 ---
    # p-nitrotoluene + MnO2/H2SO4 -> Product 2
    # The subsequent reaction (Claisen-Schmidt) requires an aldehyde.
    # Therefore, the oxidation is assumed to be controlled to yield the aldehyde, not the carboxylic acid.

    # --- Step 3: Condensation with Acetone ---
    # p-nitrobenzaldehyde + acetone + NaOH -> Product 3
    # This is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Acetone has alpha-hydrogens on both sides.
    # While a single condensation is possible (product symmetry: Cs), a double condensation is also
    # very common and leads to a more symmetrical product. In academic problems asking for symmetry,
    # the more symmetrical product from a plausible pathway is usually the intended one.
    # Assumption: A double condensation occurs.

    # A lookup table simulates this knowledge.
