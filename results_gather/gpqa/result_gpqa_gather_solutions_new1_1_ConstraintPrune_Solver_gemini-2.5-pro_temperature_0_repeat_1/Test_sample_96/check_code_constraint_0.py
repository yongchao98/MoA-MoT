    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the question about Klinefelter's syndrome.

    The question asks for the molecular mechanism that makes Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY)
    phenotypically less severe than Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21).

    The key constraints for the correct answer are:
    1.  It must be a mechanism that mitigates the *effect* of aneuploidy, not one that *causes* it.
    2.  It must explain the *difference* in handling a sex chromosome vs. an autosome.
    3.  It must occur at the correct biological time (post-fertilization/post-zygote).

    The correct biological explanation is X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), an epigenetic
    process that silences one of the X chromosomes, thus compensating for the extra
    gene dosage. This does not happen for autosomes like chromosome 21.
