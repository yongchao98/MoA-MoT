def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer by codifying the physical reasoning.

    The relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by two key factors:
    1. The relative motion of particles: The gas-gas collision formula (for λ1) includes a
       √2 factor that is absent in the electron-gas collision formula (for λ2), because
       the high-energy electrons move much faster than the gas molecules.
    2. The collision cross-sections: The kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas collision (σ_gg)
       is significantly larger than the scattering cross-section for a highly penetrating,
       high-energy electron (σ_eg).

    The function derives the ratio λ2/λ1 based on these principles and checks if the
    chosen answer 'D' is consistent with the result.

    # --- Step 1: Model the physical principles ---

    # The ratio λ2/λ1 is given by: √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # The core physical principle is that the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg) is
    # larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg).
    # We can model this by setting their ratio to a value greater than 1.
    # The exact value doesn't matter, only that it's > 1. Let's use 2 as an example.

    lambda_ratio = math.sqrt(2) * sigma_ratio

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate the given options based on the calculated ratio ---

    # The derived physical conclusion is that lambda_ratio > √2 ≈ 1.414.
