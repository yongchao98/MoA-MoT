def check_particle_decay_answer():
    """
    This function verifies the solution to the particle decay problem.

    The problem asks for the new Lorentz factor (gamma_2) required for a survival
    fraction of 2/3, given that a Lorentz factor of 20 (gamma_1) results in a
    survival fraction of 1/3.

    The physics formula relating survival fraction (f) and Lorentz factor (gamma) is:
    f = exp(-K / gamma), where K is a constant for the system.

    From this, we can derive:
    -K = gamma * ln(f)

    Since K is constant for both scenarios:
    gamma_1 * ln(f_1) = gamma_2 * ln(f_2)

    Solving for gamma_2:
    gamma_2 = gamma_1 * (ln(f_1) / ln(f_2))
