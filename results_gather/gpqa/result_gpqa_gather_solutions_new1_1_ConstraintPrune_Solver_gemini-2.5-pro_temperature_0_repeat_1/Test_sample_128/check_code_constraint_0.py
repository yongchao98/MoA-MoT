    # --- Constraint Derivation from the Question ---

    # Constraint 1: From Hint (a), a Wittig reaction on Compound A gives
    # 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
    # A retro-Wittig analysis implies Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one.
    # This means Compound A has a 5-membered ring and 2 methyl groups.
    compound_a_properties = {'ring_size': 5, 'methyl_groups': 2}

    # Constraint 2: The reaction sequence is a Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement,
    # which causes a one-carbon ring expansion.
    # Therefore, Compound E must have a ring size of A's ring size + 1.
    expected_e_ring_size = compound_a_properties['ring_size'] + 1

    # Constraint 3: The number of methyl groups is conserved.
    expected_e_methyl_groups = compound_a_properties['methyl_groups']

    # Constraint 4: Hint (b) provides IR data that confirms the ring sizes.
    # A (~1750 cm-1) is a cyclopentanone (5-ring), and E (~1715 cm-1) is a
    # cyclohexanone (6-ring). This confirms the ring expansion.
