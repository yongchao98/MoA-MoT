def check_correctness_of_chip_seq_answer(llm_answer: str) -> str:
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the ChIP-seq question.

    This function encodes biological and technical facts about ChIP-seq, fixation methods,
    and IKAROS biology as a set of logical rules. It evaluates each possible
    answer (A, B, C, D) against these rules to determine the most plausible option,
    and then compares this derived correct answer with the provided LLM answer.

    Returns:
