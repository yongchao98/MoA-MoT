Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on modeling the task as a set of constraints.

**Constraint 1: Thermodynamic Strength**

The first part of the statement is: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions."

1.  **Principle:** The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A substance with a higher (more positive) E° is a stronger oxidant.
2.  **Data:** We must compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in basic solution to its potential in another condition, implicitly acidic solution, which is the standard reference.
    *   **Acidic Solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) ; **E° = +1.23 V**
    *   **Basic Solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) ; **E° = +0.40 V**
3.  **Evaluation:** Since the reduction potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) is significantly lower than in acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.
4.  **Pruning:** This constraint eliminates any option starting with "stronger".
    *   A) stronger – slower
    *   B) weaker - slower
    *   C) stronger – faster
    *   D) weaker – faster
    *   **Candidates remaining: B, D**

**Constraint 2: Kinetic Rate**

The second part of the statement is: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions."

1.  **Principle:** Kinetics refers to the rate of a reaction. The reduction of oxygen is a complex, multi-electron process that requires breaking a strong O=O double bond. This results in a high activation energy.
2.  **Data:** Reactions with high activation energy are kinetically slow. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is famously "sluggish" or slow. Furthermore, when comparing acidic and basic media, the reaction kinetics are generally considered to be even more sluggish (slower) in acidic solutions than in alkaline (basic) solutions.
3.  **Evaluation:** Therefore, the term that correctly describes the reaction speed of oxygen in acidic solution is **slower**.
4.  **Pruning:** This constraint eliminates any option ending with "faster".
    *   A) stronger – slower
    *   B) weaker - slower
    *   C) stronger – faster
    *   D) weaker – faster
    *   **Candidates remaining: A, B**

**Final Decision**

To find the correct answer, we must find the candidate that satisfies both constraints.

*   Constraint 1 requires the first word to be **weaker**. (Candidates B, D)
*   Constraint 2 requires the second word to be **slower**. (Candidates A, B)

The only option that meets both criteria is **B**.

---
**Final Check:**

*   **Candidate B:** (weaker - slower)
*   **Constraint 1 (Thermodynamics):** Is oxygen a "weaker" oxidant in basic solutions? **Pass.** (E° is lower).
*   **Constraint 2 (Kinetics):** Does oxygen react "slower" in acidic solutions? **Pass.** (The reaction is inherently sluggish).

The candidate B passes both constraints.
