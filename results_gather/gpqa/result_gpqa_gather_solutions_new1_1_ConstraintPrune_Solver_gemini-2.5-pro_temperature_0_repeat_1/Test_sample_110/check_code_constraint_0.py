    # 3. C2 is quaternary and has no alpha-protons.
    # 4. C6 is tertiary and has one alpha-proton.
    # 5. The base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate at C6 to form the enolate.
    # 6. The enolate attacks ethyl acrylate, forming a new bond at C6.
    # 7. When naming the resulting cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain,
    #    the point of attachment (original C6) is numbered as C1'. The carbonyl group (original C1)
    #    is therefore at position C2'.
