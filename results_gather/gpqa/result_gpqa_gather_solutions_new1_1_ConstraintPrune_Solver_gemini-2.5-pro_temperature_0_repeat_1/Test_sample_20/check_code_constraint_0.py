    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.

    ### **Analysis of the Question**

    The task is to identify two compounds based on their chemical properties.

    **Part A: Tautomerism**
    The question asks for the compound that does **not** show tautomerism.
    *   **Concept:** Keto-enol tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process typically requires a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).
    *   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon to facilitate keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.
    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a saturated six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These carbons have alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.

    **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

    **Part B: Optical Isomerism**
    The question asks for the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.
    *   **Concept:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:
        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)
        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)
        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)
        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)
        Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.
    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (trans isomer). This molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.

    **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    ### **Final Decision**

    Based on the analysis:
    *   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.
    *   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    This combination corresponds to option B.

    **Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

    A review of the candidate answers shows that while many agents correctly performed the chemical analysis (like agents 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15), a significant number made a simple error in mapping their correct conclusion to the final lettered option. Agents 2, 4, and 10 correctly performed both the analysis and the final mapping.
