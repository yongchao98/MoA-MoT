An analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers leads to a definitive conclusion. The core of the problem is to understand how the solar neutrino flux changes when a specific reaction, the pp-III branch, is turned off.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Deconstruct the Premise:** The problem posits that the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, taking about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. This means the effect of the shutdown is observable on Earth right now. The primary consequence is that the flux of neutrinos from Boron-8 (`⁸B`) decay, which is the signature of the pp-III branch, becomes zero. All other reactions, specifically the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue normally.

2.  **Analyze Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**
    *   **`⁸B` neutrinos:** Flux is now zero. This was the main contributor.
    *   **`⁷Be` neutrinos:** These are produced in the pp-II branch and have a sharp energy line at 861 keV, which is outside this band.
    *   **CNO neutrinos:** These have a continuous energy spectrum and do contribute to this band.
    *   **Conclusion:** After the change, the only source of flux in Band 1 is the relatively weak, continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle.

3.  **Analyze Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**
    *   **`⁸B` neutrinos:** Flux is now zero.
    *   **`⁷Be` neutrinos:** The very strong, mono-energetic line at 861 keV from the unaffected pp-II branch falls squarely within this band.
    *   **CNO neutrinos:** The CNO cycle also contributes a weak background flux to this band.
    *   **Conclusion:** The flux in Band 2 is the sum of the extremely intense `⁷Be` line and the weak CNO background. The total flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos.

4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The ratio is Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).
    *   Numerator: A small flux from a slice of the CNO spectrum.
    *   Denominator: A very large flux dominated by the entire `⁷Be` line.
    *   The ratio is therefore a small number divided by a very large number, which results in a value much less than 1. Order-of-magnitude estimates show the `⁷Be` line flux is about 100 times greater than the CNO flux within a 100 keV band. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1/100 or 0.01.

### Careful Points to Note

*   **Source Identification:** The most critical step is correctly identifying that `⁸B` neutrinos come from the pp-III branch (which stops) and `⁷Be` neutrinos come from the pp-II branch (which continues).
*   **Spectrum Type:** The distinction between the continuous spectrum of CNO neutrinos and the sharp, mono-energetic line of `⁷Be` neutrinos is key. The entire flux of the `⁷Be` source is concentrated in Band 2, making it dominant.
*   **Relative Magnitudes:** The flux of the `⁷Be` line is one of the largest components of the solar neutrino spectrum, whereas the CNO flux is much smaller and spread over a wide energy range.
*   **Band Selection:** The energy bands are deliberately chosen to isolate the strong `⁷Be` line in the second band, ensuring a dramatic difference in flux between the two bands after the `⁸B` source is removed.

### Conclusion on Candidate Answers

The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physics and conclude that the numerical ratio is approximately 0.01. However, many of them incorrectly map this value to the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), likely due to confusion over the ordering of options in their internal generation process. Based on the original question's option list, the value 0.01 corresponds to option A.
