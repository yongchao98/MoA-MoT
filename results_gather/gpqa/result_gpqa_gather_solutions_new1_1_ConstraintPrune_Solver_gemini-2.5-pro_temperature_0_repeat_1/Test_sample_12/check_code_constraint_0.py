    # No change in tracked stereocenters.
    
    # --- Step 2: Epoxidation ---
    # Rule: m-CPBA attacks from the face 'anti' to the bulky C4-isopropyl group.
    # This creates two new stereocenters at C1 and C2.
    # Based on CIP rules for the major diastereomer from anti-attack:
    # C1 becomes (S), C2 becomes (R).
