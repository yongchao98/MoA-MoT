    This function simulates the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2
    to determine the number of possible organic products.

    The simulation follows these steps:
    1.  Define the starting molecule, 1-bromobenzene-2-d.
    2.  Simulate the two possible elimination pathways to form benzyne intermediates:
        a) Abstraction of H from C6 -> 3-deutero-benzyne.
        b) Abstraction of D from C2 -> non-deuterated benzyne.
    3.  For each unique benzyne intermediate, simulate the nucleophilic attack
        of NH2- at both possible positions.
    4.  Convert each resulting product into a canonical form to ensure
        structurally identical molecules are treated as the same.
    5.  Count the number of unique canonical products.
    6.  Compare the count to the expected answer (3).
