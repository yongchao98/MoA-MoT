    # Step 1: Calculate moles of each component.
    # KH2PO4 provides the H2PO4- ion (dihydrogen phosphate).
    moles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4
    
    # Na2HPO4‚óè2H2O provides the HPO4^2- ion (hydrogen phosphate).
    moles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O

    # Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components.
    # Convert volume from cm^3 to Liters.
    volume_L = volume_cm3 / 1000.0
    conc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L
    conc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L

    # Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2).
    # The buffer is formed by the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- conjugate acid-base pair.
    # The equilibrium is: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-
    # The equilibrium expression is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]
    # Rearranging to solve for [H+]:
    conc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)

    # Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation (Ka3).
    # The equilibrium is: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-
    # The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]
    # Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:
    calculated_conc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)
