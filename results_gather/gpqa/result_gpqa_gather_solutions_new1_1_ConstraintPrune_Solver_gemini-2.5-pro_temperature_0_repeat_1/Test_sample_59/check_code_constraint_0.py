def check_relativity_problem():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the special relativity problem.

    The core of the problem is calculating the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time)
    using the time dilation formula from special relativity.

    The formula for proper time (Δt₀) is: Δt₀ = Δt / γ
    where:
    - Δt is the time measured in the stationary frame (Earth's frame).
    - γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

    The calculation steps are:
    1. Define the constants from the problem.
    2. Assume a reasonable distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as it's not provided.
       Standard astronomical values range from 159,000 to 163,000 light-years. The provided
       solution's logic aligns with a distance of ~160,000 light-years.
    3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) based on the given speed.
    4. Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective (Δt).
    5. Calculate the travel time from the astronaut's perspective (Δt₀).
    6. Check if the astronaut survives the journey.
    7. Compare the calculated time with the given options to find the closest match.
    8. Verify if this match corresponds to the provided answer.
