    # --- Define Constants and Given Values ---
    # Rest mass energy of a proton (CODATA 2018 value in MeV)

    # around 938 MeV, which is a common approximation.

    # --- Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy (E_initial) ---
    # The problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," which implies
    # we can assume the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible.
    # The initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.
    E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the total final energy (E_final) ---
    # The final state has 4 particles of type A. By conservation of momentum
    # (initial momentum is zero), the energy is distributed equally among them.
    # The total final energy is E_final = 4 * (gamma * m_A * c^2).
    # By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.

    # --- Step 3: Solve for the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---
    # 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2
    # gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2) = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)

    gamma = E_initial / final_rest_mass_energy

    # --- Step 4: Solve for the velocity (beta = v/c) from gamma ---
    # The relationship is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).
    # Rearranging gives beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

    # true value is likely between 0.765 and 0.775. We use a tolerance to check this.
