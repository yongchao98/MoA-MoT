def check_pinacol_rearrangement_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the Pinacol rearrangement question.

    The function codifies the chemical principles for each reaction:
    1.  Reaction A (Ring Expansion): The formation of a 6-membered ring product (cyclohexanone) from a Pinacol rearrangement of this type requires a 5-membered ring starting material (cyclopentanol derivative) that undergoes ring expansion. A 6-membered ring starting material would expand to an incorrect 7-membered ring.
    2.  Reaction B (Migratory Aptitude): The rearrangement of methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate proceeds via the most stable carbocation (at the tertiary, benzylic C2 position). Subsequently, the group with the highest migratory aptitude from the adjacent C3 (Hydride vs. Methyl) shifts. The established order is H > Alkyl, so a 1,2-hydride shift occurs, leading to a ketone at C3.
