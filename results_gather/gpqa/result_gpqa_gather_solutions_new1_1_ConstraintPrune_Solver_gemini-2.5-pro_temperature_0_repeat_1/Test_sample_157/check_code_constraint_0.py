    This function checks the correctness of the answer to a molecular biology question
    about dominant-negative mutations by applying logical constraints derived from the problem statement.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the biological principles from the question as rules ---

    # Rule 1: The protein must form a dimer to be functional.
    # Rule 2: The system is haplosufficient (from mutation X context), meaning 50% of functional protein is enough for a normal phenotype.
    # Rule 3: Mutation Y is dominant-negative. This implies several sub-rules:
    #   3a. The phenotype must be a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.
    #   3b. The phenotype in a heterozygote must be mutant, not wild-type.
    #   3c. The mutant protein must interfere with the wild-type protein.
    #   3d. To interfere, the mutant protein (with a mutation in the dimerization domain) must still be able to bind to the wild-type protein. A complete loss of dimerization would prevent interference and lead to a recessive phenotype (due to Rule 2).

    # Check Rule 3b: Must be a mutant phenotype.
    if selected_option_data.phenotype_type == "wild-type":
        return "Incorrect. The answer suggests a 'wild-type phenotype', but a dominant mutation by definition causes a mutant phenotype in a heterozygote."

    # Check Rule 3d: Must be able to interact.
    if selected_option_data.interaction_effect == "no_interaction":
        return "Incorrect. The answer suggests a 'loss of protein dimerization'. If the mutant protein cannot dimerize, it cannot interfere with the wild-type protein. Due to haplosufficiency, this would result in a wild-type phenotype, making the mutation recessive, not dominant-negative."

    # --- Step 4: Differentiate between the remaining plausible options (A and C) ---
    # Both A and C passed the initial checks. Now we must determine which is the *most likely* or *best* description.
    
    # The phrase "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele" in option A is the most precise definition of a dominant-negative effect. It explains *how* the overall loss of function occurs.
    # The mechanism "protein degradation" is a very specific and common fate for malformed protein complexes (like the non-functional wild-type/mutant heterodimer) that are targeted by cellular quality control machinery.
    # Option C, "protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype," is also plausible but less specific. "Aggregation" can be a consequence, but the degradation of the "poisoned" complex is a more direct and explanatory mechanism for the functional loss of the wild-type allele's product.

    if llm_answer == "A":
        return "Correct"
    else:
        # This logic handles the case where another plausible answer like 'C' might have been chosen.
        return f"Incorrect. While option {llm_answer} describes a plausible loss-of-function mechanism, option A is superior. It provides a more precise description of the genetic effect ('loss-of-function of the wild-type allele') and a more specific, well-established molecular mechanism ('protein degradation' of the aberrant complex)."
