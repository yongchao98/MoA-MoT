    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer by recalculating the result from the problem statement.

    The problem requires finding the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 (P3/P1).

    The physical principles involved are:
    1.  The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital distance (a) for planets around the same star with the same albedo:
        T_eq ∝ 1/√a  =>  a ∝ 1/T_eq²
        Therefore, the ratio of orbital distances is a_y / a_x = (T_x / T_y)².

    2.  Kepler's Third Law, which relates orbital period (P) to orbital distance (a):
        P² ∝ a³  =>  P ∝ a^(3/2)
        Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods is P_y / P_x = (a_y / a_x)^(3/2).
