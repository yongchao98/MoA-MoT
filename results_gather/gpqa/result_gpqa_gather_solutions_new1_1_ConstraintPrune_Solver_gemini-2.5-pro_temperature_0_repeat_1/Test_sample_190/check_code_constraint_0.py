    # --- Step-by-Step Analysis of the Synthesis ---

    # Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaH, BnBr)
    # The alcohol (-CH2OH) is more acidic than the alpha-protons of the ketone.
    # It gets deprotonated by NaH and then attacks benzyl bromide.
    # Transformation: The primary alcohol is protected as a benzyl ether.
    # Expected features after Step 1: Benzyl ether, Ketone, Isopropenyl group.

    # Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, HCl)
    # The ketone reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.
    # Transformation: The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone.
    # Expected features after Step 2: Benzyl ether, Tosylhydrazone, Isopropenyl group.

    # Step 3: Shapiro Reaction (n-BuLi, NH4Cl)
    # The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile.
    # Transformation: The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated, forming a C=C double bond.
    # Expected features after Step 3: Benzyl ether, Isopropenyl group, a new C=C bond in the ring.

    # Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis (Pd/C, H2)
    # This is a powerful reduction that affects multiple groups.
    # Transformation 1 (Hydrogenation): Both C=C double bonds are reduced to single bonds.
    # The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.
    # Transformation 2 (Hydrogenolysis): The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the primary alcohol.

        # It has an alcohol on the ring (incorrect, Shapiro gives an alkene, not an alcohol).
        
        # Why B is wrong:
        # It retains the benzyl ether, which should be cleaved by H2/PdC.
        
        # Why C is wrong:
        # It contains a tosylhydrazone group, which is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).
