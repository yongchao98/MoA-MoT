    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, which is more stable than the tertiary carbocation at C3.
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): The groups on the adjacent carbon (C3) are methyl and ethyl. Ethyl has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # Conclusion: The ethyl group migrates from C3 to C4, and the ketone forms at C3.
    correct_product_A = "3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C3 is stabilized by a 4-hydroxyphenyl group (a strong electron-donating group), making it more stable than the carbocation at C2 (stabilized by a simple phenyl group).
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): The groups on the adjacent carbon (C2) are methyl and phenyl. Phenyl (aryl) has a much higher migratory aptitude than methyl (alkyl).
    # Conclusion: The phenyl group migrates from C2 to C3, and the ketone forms at C2.
    correct_product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two powerful electron-donating 4-methoxyphenyl (Anisyl) groups, making it far more stable than the carbocation at C2 (stabilized by one Anisyl and one phenyl group).
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): The groups on the adjacent carbon (C2) are Anisyl and Phenyl. The Anisyl group has a higher migratory aptitude due to its electron-donating methoxy group.
    # Conclusion: The Anisyl group migrates from C2 to C1, and the ketone forms at C2.
