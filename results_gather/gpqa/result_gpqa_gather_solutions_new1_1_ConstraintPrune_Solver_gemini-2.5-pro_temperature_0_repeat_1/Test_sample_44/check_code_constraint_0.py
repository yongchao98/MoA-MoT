def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state,
    and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D
    infinite potential well.

    Key Principles:
    1.  The energy of a single particle in state n is E_n = n^2 * E.
    2.  The particles are spin-1/2, so they are fermions.
    3.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle applies: a maximum of two particles
        (one spin-up, one spin-down) can occupy any given energy level 'n'.
