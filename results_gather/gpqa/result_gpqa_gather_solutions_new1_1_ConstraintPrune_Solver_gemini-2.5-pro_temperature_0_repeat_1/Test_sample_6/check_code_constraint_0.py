    Checks the correctness of the answer to the gamma-ray annihilation problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the physical constants and given values.
    2. Calculates the theoretical threshold energy for the gamma-ray using the
       correct physical formula.
    3. Compares the calculated value to the value of the proposed answer option.
    4. Verifies that the reasoning and final choice are consistent and correct.
