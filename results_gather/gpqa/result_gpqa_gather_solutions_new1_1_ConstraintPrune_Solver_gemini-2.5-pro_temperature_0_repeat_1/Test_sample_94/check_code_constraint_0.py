    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # The provided answer chose C. The code has verified the following logic:
    # 1. The structures and formulas are correct.
    # 2. The elimination of diols (B, D) is valid because Gilman reagents don't reduce ketones.
    # 3. The pathway from Intermediate A to Option C is stoichiometrically correct (adds two methyl groups) and fully accounts for the "excess" reagent condition.
    # 4. The pathway to Option A is also stoichiometrically plausible (adds one methyl group) but doesn't account for the excess reagent reacting at all sites.
    # The reasoning provided in the detailed answer for choosing C over A is sound and based on predictable chemical principles.
