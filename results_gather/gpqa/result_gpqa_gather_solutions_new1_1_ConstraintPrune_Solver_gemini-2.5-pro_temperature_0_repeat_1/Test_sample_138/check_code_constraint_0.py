    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Reaction: A compound treated with NaNO2, HCl, H2O produces a diketone.
    # This is a known reaction for the alpha-oxidation of ketones.
    # The reaction converts a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a carbonyl into a new carbonyl.
    # R-CO-CH2-R' ---> R-CO-CO-R'
    # Therefore, the starting materials must be ketones.

    # --- Expected Transformations ---
    # Reaction A: A ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione
    # Reaction B: B ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione

    # --- Deducing Correct Starting Materials ---
    # For Reaction A, the starting material must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one.
    # For Reaction B, the starting material must be 5-methylhexan-2-one.
