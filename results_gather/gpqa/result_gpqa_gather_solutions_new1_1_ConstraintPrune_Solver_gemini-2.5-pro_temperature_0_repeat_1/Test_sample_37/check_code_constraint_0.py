    # --- Define Chemical Principles ---

    # Principle 1: Product Prediction
    # Starting material: Derived from pentan-2-one (5 carbons).
    # Reagent: Ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) adds an ethyl group (2 carbons).
    # Base: LDA is a bulky base, favoring kinetic deprotonation at the less substituted alpha-carbon (C1).
    # Mechanism: Alkylation at C1 of pentan-2-one (CH3-CO-CH2CH2CH3) with an ethyl group gives CH3CH2-CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3.
    # This product is heptan-4-one.
    correct_product = "heptan-4-one"

    # Principle 2: Reagent Sequence
    # A multi-step synthesis requires sequential addition.
    # Step 1: Base (LDA) to form the nucleophile.
    # Step 2: Electrophile (CH3CH2I) to alkylate.
    # Step 3: Acid (H3O+) to hydrolyze and yield the final product.
    # Mixing acid with the base or the nucleophilic intermediate is chemically incorrect.
    # A correct sequence will have distinct steps, typically numbered (i), (ii), (iii).
    def is_sequence_correct(reagent_string):
        # A correct sequence has distinct steps for base, alkylating agent, and acid.
        # An incorrect sequence mixes them, e.g., adding H3O+ in step (ii).
