    # --- Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration ---
    # At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
    # pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
    
    # Calculate pKa
    pKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)
    
    # At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base (A-),
    # and 75% remains as acid (HA). The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.
    ratio_base_acid = 1 / 3
    
    calculated_ph_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_base_acid)

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point ---
    # At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.
    # Moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid
    vol_NaOH_equiv_L = initial_moles_acid / conc_NaOH_M
    
    # The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH
    total_vol_equiv_L = final_vol_diluted_acid_L + vol_NaOH_equiv_L
    
    # The concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, A-) is the initial moles of acid
    # divided by the total volume at the equivalence point.
    conc_acetate_equiv_M = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_equiv_L
    
    # The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-
    # We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.
    Kb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid
    
    # We set up an equilibrium expression to find [OH-]: Kb = [HA][OH-] / [A-]
    # Assuming [OH-] = x, this becomes Kb = x^2 / ([A-] - x).
    # Since Kb is very small, we can approximate [A-] - x â‰ˆ [A-].
    # So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])
    conc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_equiv_M)
    
    # Calculate pOH and then pH
    pOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)
    calculated_ph_equiv = 14.0 - pOH
