    Checks the correctness of the nucleophile ranking based on established chemical principles.
    
    The ranking is for reactivity in a polar protic solvent (aqueous solution).
    The principles, in order of importance, are:
    1. Charge (anion > neutral)
    2. Atom (S > O, due to polarizability and solvation effects)
    3. Resonance (localized charge > delocalized charge)
    4. Steric Hindrance (less bulky > more bulky)
