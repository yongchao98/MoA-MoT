This is a statement about the number density of stars with respect to parallax. In mathematical terms, if N is the number of stars, this relationship describes how the number of stars dN in a small parallax interval d(plx) changes. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    or\n    dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). This corresponds to the quantity dN/dr. We need to find the proportionality of dN/dr as a function of r.\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r). The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means that:\n    r = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    To convert the expression from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance, we need to find the relationship between the small interval d(plx) and the small interval dr. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax-distance relation.\n    plx = r⁻¹\n    Differentiating plx with respect to r gives:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    d(plx) = (-1/r²) dr\n    When considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, not its sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (r) increases, parallax (plx) decreases. So, we can use the magnitude:\n    |d(plx)| = (1/r²) dr\n\n5.  **Perform the Substitution:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for plx and d(plx) in terms of r into our original proportionality.\n    Original proportionality: dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    Substitute plx = 1/r:\n    dN ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    dN ∝ r⁵ d(plx)\n    Now substitute d(plx) = (1/r²) dr:\n    dN ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) dr\n    dN ∝ r⁵⁻² dr\n    dN ∝ r³ dr\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    The expression dN ∝ r³ dr tells us how the number of stars (dN) in a small distance shell (dr) depends on the distance (r). The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr. From our derived expression, we can see:\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (r³). Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ r⁵\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r²\n    D) ~ r³\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   `N`: The number of stars.\n    *   `plx`: The parallax of a star.\n    *   `r`: The distance to a star.\n    *   The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which can be written as a derivative:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = k * plx^-5` where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically the number of stars *per unit range of distance*. This is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to change variables:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We know `plx = 1/r = r^-1`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx^-5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of distance `r`:**\n    Now, replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `plx^-5 = (1/r)^-5 = r^5`\n\n8.  **Complete the substitution and simplify:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\n9.  **Interpret the result:**\n    The negative sign indicates that the number density decreases as distance increases, which is physically expected. The question asks for the proportionality, which is how the magnitude changes. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^3`.\n\n    `dN/dr ~ r^3`\n\n10. **Compare with the options:**\n    The result `~ r^3` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`) varies as `1/plx^5`. This can be written mathematically as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes with distance. In other words, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr` in terms of `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. The standard astronomical definition is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To convert the derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`) to a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`), we use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since the number of stars in a given range must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. So, we can consider `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now, substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (`r`):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in `r` using the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Proportionality:**\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) in a specific way. The number of stars per unit parallax, which can be written as the derivative dN/d(plx), is proportional to 1/plx⁵.\n    Mathematically, this is:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵  or  dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵ (where k is a constant of proportionality).\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (r), specifically the number of stars per unit range of distance. This quantity is the derivative dN/dr. We are looking for the functional relationship between dN/dr and r.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star is defined as the inverse of its distance. The standard formula is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means r = 1/plx.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    We want to find dN/dr, and we know dN/d(plx). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Missing Piece (d(plx)/dr):**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance. Using the relationship from step 3:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    Taking the derivative with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we can substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation from step 4.\n    *   From step 1: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵\n    *   From step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    So,\n    dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express the Result in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both plx and r. To get the final relationship, we need to express everything in terms of r. We use the relationship plx = 1/r from step 3.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n    dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Interpretation:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r³. The negative sign indicates that as one variable increases, the other formally decreases in the mathematical setup, but the question is about the functional dependence or the magnitude of the change. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance range varies as r³.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r^5\nB) ~ r^2\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^4\n\nThe calculated relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given how the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx): N ~ 1/plx^5.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) varies with distance (r).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, dp. This is a differential distribution, which we can write as:\n    dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^5\n\n    *Why is this the correct interpretation?* In astronomy, when discussing star counts as a function of a parameter like magnitude or parallax, it's common to refer to the number density or distribution function (i.e., the number of stars per unit interval of that parameter). A cumulative count would typically be specified more explicitly, for example, \"the total number of stars with parallax greater than plx\". For a uniform star distribution, it is a known result that dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^4. The problem presents a similar, but slightly different, power law.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks \"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the quantity dN/dr.\n\n4.  **Relate the Variables:**\n    We need to find a relationship between dN/dr and dN/d(plx). We can do this using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Find the Necessary Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax (plx) with respect to distance (r). The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n\n    Now, we differentiate plx with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Combine the Pieces:**\n    Now substitute the given information and the derivative we just calculated into the chain rule equation:\n    dN/dr ~ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To find the final relationship with `r`, we must replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (plx = 1/r):\n    dN/dr ~ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ~ (r^5) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ~ -r^(5-2)\n    dN/dr ~ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, is proportional to r³. The negative sign is a result of the inverse relationship between parallax and distance and can be ignored when considering only the proportionality of the magnitudes.\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r³.\n\n    This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship in a specific region of the sky: \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   Let 'N' be the number of stars and 'plx' be the parallax. The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5.\n    *   We need to determine how the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, changes with distance, r.\n\n2.  **Interpret the phrase \"number of stars varies with...\":**\n    In astronomy, statements about number counts (e.g., \"number of stars/galaxies\") as a function of an observable quantity (like magnitude, flux, or parallax) often refer to the **cumulative number** of objects. For example, \"the number of stars brighter than magnitude m\" or \"the number of galaxies with flux greater than S\".\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r): plx = 1/r.\n    *   A larger parallax means a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax means a larger distance.\n    *   It is standard to count stars *out to* a certain distance r, which we denote as N(<r). This corresponds to counting stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value plx = 1/r, which we can denote as N(>plx).\n    *   Therefore, the most plausible interpretation of the statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" is that it describes the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than plx.\n    *   So, we have: N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5.\n\n3.  **Translate the Relationship from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance, r.\n    *   The cumulative number of stars within a distance r is N(<r).\n    *   Since r = 1/plx, a star being within distance r is equivalent to its parallax being greater than plx. So, N(<r) = N(>plx).\n    *   Substitute plx = 1/r into the given relationship:\n        N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5\n        N(<r) ∝ r^5\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars \"change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the definition of the derivative, dN/dr.\n    *   We can find dN/dr by differentiating the cumulative number N(<r) with respect to r.\n    *   Let N(<r) = k * r^5, where k is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   Differentiate N(<r) with respect to r:\n        dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)\n        dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)\n        dN/dr = 5k * r^4\n    *   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r^4.\n    *   dN/dr ∝ r^4\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) in proportion to r^4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, which we'll denote as `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n    This means `N` is proportional to `plx` raised to the power of -5. The term \"number of stars\" in this context typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed with a parallax greater than a certain value, which corresponds to stars being closer than a certain distance.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance (`r`). For standard units (parallax in arcseconds, distance in parsecs), the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n    Or, in terms of proportionality:\n    `plx ∝ 1 / r`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    Now, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given formula for the number of stars.\n    Since `N ∝ 1 / plx^5` and `plx ∝ 1 / r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. We can write this as an equation `N = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is mathematically represented by the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    We need to differentiate our expression for `N` with respect to `r`:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n * x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = (5k) * r^4`\n\n5.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, the relationship simplifies to:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the fourth power of the distance. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) ~ r^3\n    B) ~ r^5\n    C) ~ r^4\n    D) ~ r^2\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as:\n    `N ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\n    This `N` represents the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For a star at distance `r`, its parallax `plx` is given by:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice-versa. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars with parallax `≥ plx` is the same as the cumulative number of stars with distance `≤ r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** We can substitute the distance relationship into the given star count formula. Let `N(r)` be the number of stars within a distance `r`.\n\n    `N(r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N(r) ∝ r^5`\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with `r`. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We differentiate the relationship `N(r) ∝ r^5` with respect to `r`.\n    Let `N(r) = C * r^5`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:** From the differentiation, we see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:** Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) ~ r^5\n    B) ~ r^2\n    C) ~ r^4\n    D) ~ r^3\n\n    The calculated relationship `~ r^4` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Given:** A relationship for the number of stars as a function of parallax (`plx`). Specifically, \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   **To Find:** The relationship for the number of stars as a function of distance (`r`). Specifically, how the number of stars \"change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".\n    *   **Implicit Information:** The physical relationship between distance and parallax.\n\n2.  **Translate the Phrases into Mathematical Expressions:**\n    *   \"The number of stars ... per unit range of distance, r\" is the differential quantity `dN/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    *   \"The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" most likely refers to the number of stars per unit parallax interval. This is the density function in parallax space, which is the differential quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   So, the given information is `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. Let's write this as `dN/d(plx) = C * plx^(-5)`, where C is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   We need to find the functional form of `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Connection between Variables:**\n    *   The parallax (`plx`) of a star is, by definition, inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The simplest form of this relationship is `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   From this, we can also write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan to Convert the Density Functions:**\n    *   We want to convert a function of `plx` into a function of `r`. The chain rule from calculus is the perfect tool for this.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in a small interval is the same regardless of whether we measure it using distance or parallax.

For stars, it's inversely proportional to their distance (`r`). The relationship is given by:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r`\n    or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Use the given information about the number of stars and parallax.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars `N` depends on the distance `r`. We can substitute the relationship from step 1 into the equation from step 2. Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This means the *total* number of stars counted up to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the density of stars as a function of distance, which is the derivative of the total number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    If we let `N(r) = k * r^5` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), then we can differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ r^4` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and distance (`r`), given a relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\nThe number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n**3. Identify the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\nDistance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related. The standard definition in astronomy is:\n`r = 1/plx`\nThis also means:\n`plx = 1/r`\n\n**4. Formulate a Plan using the Chain Rule:**\nWe want to find `dN/dr`. We have an expression for `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**5. Execute the Plan:**\n*   **Step 5a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n*   **Step 5b: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n    We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵ = 1/(r⁻⁵) = r⁵`\n\n*   **Step 5c: Combine the parts using the chain rule**\n    Now substitute the results from steps 5a and 5b into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n**6. Interpret the Result:**\nThe term `dN/dr` represents the number density of stars at a distance `r`. This quantity must be positive (we can't have a negative number of stars). The negative sign arises from the fact that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (an inverse relationship). When relating the densities, we are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n\nA more formal way to handle this is to relate the number of stars `dN` in a small interval. The number of stars in a distance shell `dr` must equal the number of stars in the corresponding parallax shell `d(plx)`. Since `dN` must be positive:\n`dN = |(dN/dr) * dr| = |(dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)|`\nThis implies:\n`(dN/dr) = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\nUsing our previously calculated values:\n`(dN/dr) ∝ (r⁵) * |-1/r²|`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²)`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes proportionally to `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem asks how the number of stars per unit distance, which we can denote as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    *   The number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`. This can be written as `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`). The formula is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   We start with the given relationship: `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   Substitute the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) into the equation:\n        `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   Simplifying the exponent, we get:\n        `N ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This expression `N(r) ∝ r⁵` represents the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars ... per unit range of distance\". This is equivalent to finding the density of stars at a particular distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    *   Let's write the proportionality as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n        `N(r) = k * r⁵`\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r` using the power rule of differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   From this result, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr ∝ r⁴` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (dN/dr) and the distance (r).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) according to the following relation:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to plx⁻⁵.\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** Parallax (plx) and distance (r) are inversely related. The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Differentiation:** We need to find dN/dr, but we have an expression for dN/d(plx). We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:** We need to find the term d(plx)/dr.\n    Given plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    The derivative is:\n    d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Quantities into the Chain Rule Equation:** Now, we replace the terms in the chain rule equation with the expressions we know.\n    -   From the problem statement: dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    -   From our calculation in step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    Substituting these into the chain rule formula gives:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The final goal is a relationship involving only 'r'. We use the parallax-distance relation (plx = 1/r) to eliminate 'plx' from the equation.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the term 1/plx⁵:\n    1/plx⁵ = 1/((1/r)⁵) = 1/(1/r⁵) = r⁵\n\n8.  **Final Substitution and Simplification:** Now substitute this result back into our proportionality for dN/dr:\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁵⁻²\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\nThe negative sign indicates that for a positive d(plx), there is a negative dr, which is consistent with their inverse relationship. The question asks how the number of stars *changes with* distance, which refers to the magnitude of the distribution. Therefore, we are interested in the proportionality:\n\ndN/dr ∝ r³\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of distance scales as the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars (`N`) and their parallax (`plx`). The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as a distribution function, meaning the number of stars per unit interval of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Establish the Key Relationships:**\n    *   **Given distribution:**\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   **Relationship between parallax and distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is the inverse of the distance (`r`). For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   **Goal:** Find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule (Change of Variables):**\n    To convert the distribution from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance, we use the chain rule from calculus. The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`.\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Therefore:\n    `(dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for our target `dN/dr`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n    We use the absolute value because the number of stars must be positive, while the derivative `d(plx)/dr` is negative (as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the known parts back into our chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (1/r²)`\n\n    We also need to express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`. We know `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` and `plx = 1/r`:\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5`.\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the equation for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance `r` changes proportionally to `r³`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. In astronomical contexts, \"number of stars\" typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed that are brighter or closer than a certain limit. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    Here, `N(>plx)` is the total number of stars with parallax greater than the value `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely proportional. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a star at distance `r` has a parallax of `1/r`. Consequently, all stars with a parallax greater than `plx` are located within the distance `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:** We can now rewrite the relationship from step 1 in terms of distance `r`. The number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than `1/r`.\n    Substituting `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance\". This is the star number density with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `N(<r) = C * r⁵`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`.

In astronomy, star counts given as a function of an observable like magnitude or parallax typically refer to the cumulative number of objects observed up to that limit (i.e., brighter than, or closer than/with parallax greater than).

This is a statement about the number density of stars with respect to parallax. In mathematical terms, if N is the number of stars, this relationship describes how the number of stars dN in a small parallax interval d(plx) changes. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    or\n    dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). This corresponds to the quantity dN/dr. We need to find the proportionality of dN/dr as a function of r.\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r). The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means that:\n    r = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    To convert the expression from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance, we need to find the relationship between the small interval d(plx) and the small interval dr. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax-distance relation.\n    plx = r⁻¹\n    Differentiating plx with respect to r gives:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    d(plx) = (-1/r²) dr\n    When considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, not its sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (r) increases, parallax (plx) decreases. So, we can use the magnitude:\n    |d(plx)| = (1/r²) dr\n\n5.  **Perform the Substitution:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for plx and d(plx) in terms of r into our original proportionality.\n    Original proportionality: dN ∝ plx⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    Substitute plx = 1/r:\n    dN ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ d(plx)\n    dN ∝ r⁵ d(plx)\n    Now substitute d(plx) = (1/r²) dr:\n    dN ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) dr\n    dN ∝ r⁵⁻² dr\n    dN ∝ r³ dr\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    The expression dN ∝ r³ dr tells us how the number of stars (dN) in a small distance shell (dr) depends on the distance (r).

This is equivalent to finding the density of stars as a function of distance, which is the derivative of the total number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    If we let `N(r) = k * r^5` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), then we can differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ r^4` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and distance (`r`), given a relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\nThe number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n**3. Identify the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\nDistance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related. The standard definition in astronomy is:\n`r = 1/plx`\nThis also means:\n`plx = 1/r`\n\n**4. Formulate a Plan using the Chain Rule:**\nWe want to find `dN/dr`. We have an expression for `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**5. Execute the Plan:**\n*   **Step 5a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n*   **Step 5b: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n    We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵ = 1/(r⁻⁵) = r⁵`\n\n*   **Step 5c: Combine the parts using the chain rule**\n    Now substitute the results from steps 5a and 5b into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n**6. Interpret the Result:**\nThe term `dN/dr` represents the number density of stars at a distance `r`. This quantity must be positive (we can't have a negative number of stars). The negative sign arises from the fact that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (an inverse relationship). When relating the densities, we are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n\nA more formal way to handle this is to relate the number of stars `dN` in a small interval. The number of stars in a distance shell `dr` must equal the number of stars in the corresponding parallax shell `d(plx)`. Since `dN` must be positive:\n`dN = |(dN/dr) * dr| = |(dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)|`\nThis implies:\n`(dN/dr) = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\nUsing our previously calculated values:\n`(dN/dr) ∝ (r⁵) * |-1/r²|`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²)`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes proportionally to `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem asks how the number of stars per unit distance, which we can denote as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    *   The number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`. This can be written as `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`). The formula is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   We start with the given relationship: `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   Substitute the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) into the equation:\n        `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   Simplifying the exponent, we get:\n        `N ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This expression `N(r) ∝ r⁵` represents the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars ... per unit range of distance\". This is equivalent to finding the density of stars at a particular distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    *   Let's write the proportionality as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n        `N(r) = k * r⁵`\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r` using the power rule of differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   From this result, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr ∝ r⁴` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (dN/dr) and the distance (r).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) according to the following relation:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to plx⁻⁵.\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** Parallax (plx) and distance (r) are inversely related. The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Differentiation:** We need to find dN/dr, but we have an expression for dN/d(plx). We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:** We need to find the term d(plx)/dr.\n    Given plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    The derivative is:\n    d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Quantities into the Chain Rule Equation:** Now, we replace the terms in the chain rule equation with the expressions we know.\n    -   From the problem statement: dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    -   From our calculation in step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    Substituting these into the chain rule formula gives:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The final goal is a relationship involving only 'r'. We use the parallax-distance relation (plx = 1/r) to eliminate 'plx' from the equation.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the term 1/plx⁵:\n    1/plx⁵ = 1/((1/r)⁵) = 1/(1/r⁵) = r⁵\n\n8.  **Final Substitution and Simplification:** Now substitute this result back into our proportionality for dN/dr:\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁵⁻²\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\nThe negative sign indicates that for a positive d(plx), there is a negative dr, which is consistent with their inverse relationship. The question asks how the number of stars *changes with* distance, which refers to the magnitude of the distribution. Therefore, we are interested in the proportionality:\n\ndN/dr ∝ r³\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of distance scales as the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars (`N`) and their parallax (`plx`). The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as a distribution function, meaning the number of stars per unit interval of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Establish the Key Relationships:**\n    *   **Given distribution:**\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   **Relationship between parallax and distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is the inverse of the distance (`r`). For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   **Goal:** Find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule (Change of Variables):**\n    To convert the distribution from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance, we use the chain rule from calculus. The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`.\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Therefore:\n    `(dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for our target `dN/dr`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n    We use the absolute value because the number of stars must be positive, while the derivative `d(plx)/dr` is negative (as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the known parts back into our chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (1/r²)`\n\n    We also need to express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`. We know `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` and `plx = 1/r`:\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5`.\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the equation for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance `r` changes proportionally to `r³`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. In astronomical contexts, \"number of stars\" typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed that are brighter or closer than a certain limit. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    Here, `N(>plx)` is the total number of stars with parallax greater than the value `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely proportional. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a star at distance `r` has a parallax of `1/r`. Consequently, all stars with a parallax greater than `plx` are located within the distance `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:** We can now rewrite the relationship from step 1 in terms of distance `r`. The number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than `1/r`.\n    Substituting `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance\". This is the star number density with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `N(<r) = C * r⁵`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
