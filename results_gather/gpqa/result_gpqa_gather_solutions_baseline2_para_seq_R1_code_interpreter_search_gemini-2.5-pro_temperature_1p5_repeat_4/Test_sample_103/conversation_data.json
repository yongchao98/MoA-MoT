The change in a star's light wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to its velocity (v) along our line of sight. The problem gives the *maximum periodic shift*, which corresponds to the maximum velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ for the star hosting planet #1.\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ for the star hosting planet #2.\n\n    From the proportionality K ∝ Δλ, we can find the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula that depends on the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's orbital period (T). Let's derive the relationship.\n\n    *   From the conservation of momentum (in the center-of-mass frame), the star's velocity (v_star) is related to the planet's velocity (v_planet) by: M_star * v_star = m_p * v_planet. The maximum value of v_star is K, so we can write: K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is v_planet = 2πa / T, where 'a' is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law for a planet much less massive than its star, T² ∝ a³. This means a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting 'a' into the velocity equation: v_planet ∝ T^(2/3) / T = T^(-1/3).\n    *   Combining these relationships, we get: K ∝ v_planet ∝ T^(-1/3).\n\n    So, the key proportionality is: **K ∝ T^(-1/3)**.\n\n    This holds because the problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2), so all other factors in the full equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality K ∝ T^(-1/3), we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    We can rewrite this as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    To solve for the desired ratio T₂ / T₁, we first cube both sides:\n    (K₂ / K₁)³ = T₁ / T₂\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get T₂ / T₁:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5. This means K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n    Substitute this into our final equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\n    The Python script confirmed the numerical result:\n    125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) ~ 1.40\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 0.85\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe reasoning and calculation have been completed.\n\n1.  The ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes ($K$) is equal to the ratio of the observed periodic wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7 \\text{ mÅ} / 5 \\text{ mÅ} = 1.4$\n\n2.  The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$.\n\n3.  Given that the star masses ($M_{star}$) and planet masses ($m_p$) are the same for both systems, and assuming the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same, the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  We can set up a ratio:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = (T_2 / T_1)^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  Substituting the known value for the velocity ratio and solving for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$):\n    $1.4 = (T_2 / T_1)^{-1/3}$\n    To isolate the period ratio, we raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    $(T_2 / T_1) = (1.4)^{-3} = 1 / (1.4^3) = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option C. The python code execution confirmed this result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the host star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight ($m_p \\sin(i)$ is the minimum mass).\n    *   $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the mass of the star.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the equation for each system:\n    $K_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}$\n    $K_2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}$\n\n    Now, let's take the ratio $K_1 / K_2$:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using the Given Information**\n    The problem provides the following key information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses. In the context of RV measurements, this implies their minimum masses are the same: $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n    *   $2\\pi G$ is a constant.\n\n    Canceling these identical terms from the numerator and denominator simplifies the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{P_1} \\cdot \\frac{P_2}{1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n    We now have a simple relationship between the velocity ratio and the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the known value of the velocity ratio from step 1:\n    $\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**\n    Calculating the decimal value of the fraction:\n    $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

This asks for the ratio $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The RV method's observable is the Doppler shift, which gives the star's radial velocity. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    *   Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity.\n    *   Therefore, the semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We can establish the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physics Formula:**\n    *   We need the formula that connects the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) to the orbital period ($P$) and other system parameters.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n        $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{*}^{2/3}}$\n    *   Where:\n        *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n        *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n        *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n        *   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n        *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula Based on the Problem's Conditions:**\n    *   We are comparing two systems. Let's look at what is constant and what is changing between them.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are physical constants.\n    *   $M_*$ is the same for both stars ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$).\n    *   $m_p \\sin(i)$ is assumed to be the same for both planets ($m_{p1}\\sin(i_1) = m_{p2}\\sin(i_2)$).\n    *   This means all parts of the formula are constant except for $K$ and $P$.

Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is $K_2/K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7/5 = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relation between Velocity Amplitude and Orbital Period:** For an exoplanet in a circular orbit detected via the radial velocity method, the velocity amplitude $K$ is related to the orbital period $P$ by the formula $K \\propto \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$. Since the stellar masses ($M_*$) are the same, the planetary masses ($m_p$) are similar, and we assume the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same for a solvable problem, we get the simplified proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:**\n    From the proportionality, we can write:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the known values:\n    $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the required ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we first solve for its inverse by cubing both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3$\n\n    Finally, take the reciprocal to get the answer:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** The value of $(5/7)^3$ was computed using the provided Python code.\n\n    `Execution Output: 0.3644314868804665`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the calculated result with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.85\n    B) ~ 0.36\n    C) ~ 1.40\n    D) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the reasoning and the code execution result, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K):** The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relationship between Velocity (K) and Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude $K$ is related to the system's properties. Given that the star masses are identical, the planet masses are similar, and we assume the orbital inclinations are the same, the relationship simplifies to:\n    *   $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$ (where T is the orbital period).\n\n3.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the orbital periods:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We combine the two expressions for the ratio $\\frac{K_2}{K_1}$:\n    *   $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we first solve for $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$ by cubing both sides:\n        *   $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\implies 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    *   Finally, we invert the result to get the desired ratio:\n        *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThe result ~0.3644 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity and Wavelength Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The amplitude of the star's velocity ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) observed. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude ($K$) is related to the orbital period ($T$) and other system parameters by the formula:\n    $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$ (assuming $M_{star} \\gg M_p$)\n    Since the stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$), and assuming a similar orbital inclination ($i$) for both detected planets, we can see that the velocity amplitude $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$.\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solving for T2/T1:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    $1.4 = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$\n    To find the period ratio, we first cube both sides:\n    $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($T_2/T_1$).

The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be redshifted when it moves away from us and blueshifted when it moves towards us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift formula is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity (its velocity component along our line of sight), and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem states the *periodic shift of a spectral line* is \"up to\" a certain value. This maximum shift, $(\\Delta\\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity amplitude, $K$.\n    $$ K \\propto (\\Delta\\lambda)_{max} $$\n    We are given:\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_2)_{max}}{(\\Delta\\lambda_1)_{max}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude of the host star can be expressed as:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze the System Parameters:** The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem's structure implies that other factors are constant. A definitive answer requires assuming the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems. We can write the proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}} $$\n    This means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** From the proportionality, we can set up a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{1/P_2^{1/3}}{1/P_1^{1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Result:** Now, we substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n    So,\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n    ```python\n    print((5/7)**3)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    0.3644314868804665\n    </execute_result>\n\n    The result is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

The fractional wavelength shift (`Δλ/λ`) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`v_r`) of the star along the line of sight: `Δλ/λ = v_r/c`.\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the semi-amplitude `K`.\n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\n    *   For planet #1, `Δλ_max1` = 5 milliangstroms.

Let its stellar velocity semi-amplitude be `K2`.\n\n    The ratio of the stellar velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n    `K = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * ( m_p * sin(i) ) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Equation based on Given Information**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses, which in the context of the RV method implies the measured *minimum mass* (`m_p * sin(i)`) is the same for both. This is because the signal amplitude depends on this combined term.\n\n    Since `G`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star` are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `K2 / K1` we found earlier:\n    `1.4 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    To solve for `T2/T1`, first cube both sides:\n    `(1.4)^3 = T1 / T2`\n    `2.744 = T1 / T2`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio `T2 / T1`, so we take the reciprocal:\n    `T2 / T1 = 1 / 2.744`\n    `T2 / T1 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Radial Velocity (RV) Method Basics:**\n\nThe RV method detects the periodic wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light.\nThe amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`, is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) observed.\nSo, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n**2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude (`K`) is given by the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_s` is the star's mass.\n\n**3. Setting up the Proportionality:**\n\nIn this problem, we are told that the stars have the same mass (`M_s1 = M_s2`) and the planets have the same mass (`M_p1 = M_p2`). Therefore, `M_p`, `M_s`, and the term `(2πG)` are all constants when comparing the two systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n\n`K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\nThis means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4.

Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio. First, invert both sides:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**5. Substituting the Observational Data:**\n\nWe know that `K ∝ Δλ`, so `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nThe problem gives us:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nTherefore, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nNow substitute this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**6.

The change in a star's light wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to its velocity (v) along our line of sight. The problem gives the *maximum periodic shift*, which corresponds to the maximum velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    Therefore, we have the relationship:\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ for the star hosting planet #1.\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ for the star hosting planet #2.\n\n    From the proportionality K ∝ Δλ, we can find the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula that depends on the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's orbital period (T). Let's derive the relationship.\n\n    *   From the conservation of momentum (in the center-of-mass frame), the star's velocity (v_star) is related to the planet's velocity (v_planet) by: M_star * v_star = m_p * v_planet. The maximum value of v_star is K, so we can write: K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is v_planet = 2πa / T, where 'a' is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law for a planet much less massive than its star, T² ∝ a³. This means a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting 'a' into the velocity equation: v_planet ∝ T^(2/3) / T = T^(-1/3).\n    *   Combining these relationships, we get: K ∝ v_planet ∝ T^(-1/3).\n\n    So, the key proportionality is: **K ∝ T^(-1/3)**.\n\n    This holds because the problem states that the star masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2), so all other factors in the full equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality K ∝ T^(-1/3), we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    We can rewrite this as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)⁽¹/³⁾\n\n    To solve for the desired ratio T₂ / T₁, we first cube both sides:\n    (K₂ / K₁)³ = T₁ / T₂\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get T₂ / T₁:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5.

This is because the signal amplitude depends on this combined term.\n\n    Since `G`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star` are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `K2 / K1` we found earlier:\n    `1.4 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    To solve for `T2/T1`, first cube both sides:\n    `(1.4)^3 = T1 / T2`\n    `2.744 = T1 / T2`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio `T2 / T1`, so we take the reciprocal:\n    `T2 / T1 = 1 / 2.744`\n    `T2 / T1 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (`P₂`) to that of planet #1 (`P₁`).\n\n**1. Radial Velocity (RV) Method Basics:**\n\nThe RV method detects the periodic wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light.\nThe amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`, is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) observed.\nSo, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n\n**2. The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude (`K`) is given by the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_s` is the star's mass.\n\n**3. Setting up the Proportionality:**\n\nIn this problem, we are told that the stars have the same mass (`M_s1 = M_s2`) and the planets have the same mass (`M_p1 = M_p2`). Therefore, `M_p`, `M_s`, and the term `(2πG)` are all constants when comparing the two systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n\n`K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\nThis means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Forming the Ratio:**\n\nWe can write a ratio for the two systems:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂^(1/3)) / (1 / P₁^(1/3))`\n`K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\nWe want to find `P₂ / P₁`. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for that ratio. First, invert both sides:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, cube both sides to isolate the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**5. Substituting the Observational Data:**\n\nWe know that `K ∝ Δλ`, so `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nThe problem gives us:\n*   `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n\nTherefore, `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\nNow substitute this into our equation for the period ratio:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n**6. Calculation:**\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 * 5 * 5) / (7 * 7 * 7) = 125 / 343`\n\n`P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code executed the calculation `(5/7)**3` and returned the value `0.3644315252422181`.\n\nThis calculated value represents the ratio T₂ / T₁, which is how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.364 is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
