This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom is unaffected and remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (Note: If we number the triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -H⁺   (d)C-------C\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate A: 3-deuterobenzyne)\n        ```\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -d⁺   (H)C-------C(H)\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate B: benzyne)\n        ```\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. Attack can occur at either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne B (benzyne):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion intermediate, which upon protonation gives the same final product.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. The final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide anion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker and break more quickly than C-D bonds).\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this pathway and remains in the molecule.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Although slower, it is still possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide anion (:NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position).\n    *   So, this pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This creates a carbanion at C2. Protonation by NH3 yields **aniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C2:** This creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 also yields **aniline**.\n    *   So, this pathway produces only one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified the following unique organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules are structurally distinct isomers. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n        *   The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n        *   This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium in this intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n    *   Pathway B yields one product: aniline.\n    *   Since all three of these molecules are structurally different, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted as 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways can occur, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: C-H bonds are broken more easily than C-D bonds, so this pathway is slower, but it still occurs).\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the benzyne triple bond.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the C1 position, the deuterium atom is at C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of this symmetric benzyne.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C2, which is then protonated. The product is **aniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C2:** The NH₂ group adds to C2. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The product is also **aniline**.\n\n        So, Pathway B leads to only one product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H+) from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D+) from C2 is also possible, although slower. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n        1.

Importantly, since the deuterium atom was abstracted, this benzyne intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne** (it contains no deuterium).\n\nSo, we have two distinct benzyne intermediates forming concurrently: 3-deuteriobenzyne and unlabeled benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the highly reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1, creating a carbanion at C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6, creating a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2, which are meta to each other).\n\n*   **Products from unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The amide ion attacks the symmetric benzyne. Attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by the solvent. Since this intermediate has no deuterium, the final product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products are formed:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the D-abstraction pathway)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from the H-abstraction pathway)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from the H-abstraction pathway)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The structure is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, and then addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Reaction from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by ammonia (NH3) yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by ammonia yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Reaction from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is the simple, unsubstituted benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of the same product after protonation. The product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine (Br) atom is at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). This is a very strong base (amide ion, NH₂⁻) used in a polar solvent.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This forms a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This forms a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate** (regular benzyne).\n\n*   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and occurs faster than Pathway B (abstraction of D). However, both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n**4. Step 2: Addition (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon atom of the benzyne \"triple bond\".\n\n*   **Addition to the Deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C1. A negative charge forms on C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C6. A negative charge forms on C1, which is protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces **two different deuterated products**.\n\n*   **Addition to the Non-deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    *   This intermediate is simply benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2. Regardless of where it attacks, the subsequent protonation results in the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Thus, Pathway B produces **one non-deuterated product**.\n\n**5. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible initial elimination pathways, we identify three unique organic products that can be formed:\n\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n        *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the proton from C-6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  The carbanion intermediate quickly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you renumber the benzyne so the triple bond is between C1 and C2, the deuterium is on C3).\n\n        *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2.** Although slower than H-abstraction, this pathway is still possible.\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the deuteron from C-2, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium atom.\n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are possible: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Pathway A) and **benzyne** (from Pathway B).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the products from each intermediate:\n\n        *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Intermediate from Pathway A):**\n            *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6 (original numbering), and the deuterium is at C-2.\n            *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This places a negative charge on C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the -D is at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This places a negative charge on C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the -D is at C-2. Relative to the new -NH2 group, the deuterium is three carbons away. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   Thus, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n        *   **Products from benzyne (Intermediate from Pathway B):**\n            *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n            *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n            *   Thus, Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   By considering all possible, chemically reasonable pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n        1.  Aniline\n        2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n        3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n    The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. Sodium amide is a very strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction mechanism.**\n    This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate. Aromatic halides that lack strong electron-withdrawing groups do not undergo standard nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr). Instead, in the presence of a very strong base like NaNH2, they undergo elimination followed by addition.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the elimination step (formation of benzyne).**\n    The amide ion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    1.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    2.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    Both D at C2 and H at C6 can be abstracted by the amide ion, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2.**\n        The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is standard benzyne (C6H4), which has no deuterium.\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -D+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate A) Benzyne\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6.**\n        The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the benzene ring. The resulting intermediate is a deuterated benzyne, specifically 3-deuterobenzyne (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at position 2 relative to C1, which is position 3 on the new benzyne ring system).\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -H+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate B) 3-Deuterobenzyne\n\n    *Note on Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):* The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so abstraction of the proton from C6 (Pathway B) is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 (Pathway A). However, the question asks for the number of *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is favored.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the addition step for each benzyne intermediate.**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (Benzyne):**\n        Benzyne is symmetrical. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond. Both attacks, after protonation, lead to the same product: aniline.\n\n        Benzyne + NH2- -> Anion -> +NH3 -> **Product 1: Aniline (C6H5NH2)**\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (3-Deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is not symmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 at C6 yields 2-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are ortho to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C1; 2.

Protonation)--> **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\n    From the two possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** An aryl halide reacting with a strong base like sodium amide proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism. The intermediate in this reaction is a highly reactive species called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step):**\n    The amide anion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Since both positions are ortho to the bromine, abstraction from either is possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. This benzyne still contains the deuterium atom at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne I**.\n        *(Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this pathway is kinetically favored and will be the major route, but the question asks for all *possible* products).*\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n        2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a different benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule. Let's call this **Benzyne II**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step):**\n    The benzyne intermediates are then attacked by a nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne I (Deuterated):**\n        This benzyne is unsymmetrical. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When we re-number this molecule according to IUPAC rules (starting from the carbon with the -NH₂ group), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Benzyne I leads to two distinct, deuterated products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne II (Non-deuterated):**\n        This benzyne also has a triple bond between C1 and C2, but no deuterium. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 by the solvent NH₃ adds a regular hydrogen atom. The product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C2. A carbanion forms at C1, which is protonated by NH₃. The product is also **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Benzyne II leads to only one distinct product.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A, attack at C1)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A, attack at C6)\n    3.

The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide (like 1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (like NaNH₂) proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, specifically involving a **benzyne** (or aryne) intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the ortho positions to C1 (which has Br) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. These two possibilities lead to two different reaction pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This is a slower process than abstracting H⁺ but is still a possible reaction pathway.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this benzyne intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6.

(The NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2, making them *meta* to each other).\n        *   So, Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2.

Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   The C6 position, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of a proton (H⁺) is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺). However, both reactions are possible. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n3.  **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway)**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This elimination results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where a new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway)**\n    *   Less frequently, the amide ion can remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   The resulting benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is a **non-deuterated benzyne**. The removed deuterium ends up forming deuterated ammonia (NH₂D).\n\n     \n\n5.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n6.  **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. Numbering the ring starting from the -NH₂ group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces two distinct isomers: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n     \n\n7.  **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne)**\n    *   The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2, but since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same initial carbanion (o-aminophenyl anion).\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n    *   The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   (Note: The aminophenyl anion could also be deuterated by the NH₂D formed in this pathway, which would lead to 2-deuterioaniline. However, this is a product already accounted for in Pathway A. The new, unique product from this pathway is aniline.)\n\n     \n\n8.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The reaction produces a mixture of three structurally distinct organic products:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    *   Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, which means we must consider all chemically viable pathways, even those that are slower.\n\nThe correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at the adjacent position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (aryl halide with no activating groups, very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base, abstracting an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n**Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is weaker and is cleaved more readily than the C-D bond. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Consequently, Pathway A (H abstraction) will be significantly faster and thus the major pathway, while Pathway B (D abstraction) will be slower and the minor pathway. However, since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider all chemically feasible pathways, even the minor ones.\n\nTherefore, **two different benzyne intermediates** are formed in the reaction: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and unlabeled benzyne (minor).\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the newly formed benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) can also act as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with an -NH2 group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation yields a product with an -NH2 group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. To name this compound, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, so C6 becomes C1'. In this new numbering, the deuterium is at C3'. The product is **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) gives **two distinct products**.\n\n*   **Attack on unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. It is symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **1-aminobenzene** (or aniline).\n    *   Thus, the minor intermediate (benzyne) gives only **one product**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we get three unique organic molecules:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.  1-aminobenzene (aniline)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a classic problem involving the benzyne mechanism in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction to determine the number of possible products.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine (Br) at position C1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions: C6 (bearing a hydrogen, H) and C2 (bearing a deuterium, D). This leads to two competing pathways for the initial elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a **3-deuteriobenzyne** intermediate. The deuterium atom remains on the ring at position C2.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower but still occurs.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH2⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ attacks C1. The resulting carbanion is at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups are adjacent.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ attacks C6. The resulting carbanion is at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups have a meta relationship.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Summary of Products**\nBy considering both pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Analyze the Core Chemical Problem**\nThe reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Breakdown (Consensus from Agents)**\n\n*   **Step A: Elimination (Formation of Intermediates)**\n    The strong base (amide ion, NH₂⁻) must abstract a hydrogen/deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine. There are two such positions:\n    1.  **C6:** Has a hydrogen (H). Abstraction of H⁺ and elimination of Br⁻ forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    2.  **C2:** Has a deuterium (D). Abstraction of D⁺ and elimination of Br⁻ forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is lost in this process. This intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed. This point is correctly identified by all the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step B: Addition (Formation of Products)**\n    The nucleophile (amide ion, NH₂⁻) attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n    1.  **From 3-deuterobenzyne:** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH₂⁻ can attack C1 (yielding **2-deuteroaniline**) or C6 (yielding **3-deuteroaniline**). This pathway produces **two** distinct products.\n    2.  **From unlabeled benzyne:** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields the same single product: **aniline**. This pathway produces **one** distinct product.\n\n**3. Tallying the Final Products**\nBy combining the outcomes of all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThe total number of possible products is 3.\n\n**4.

The discrepancies are in the final selection, not the analysis. Based on the overwhelming consensus of the step-by-step logic, the correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3).

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom is unaffected and remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (Note: If we number the triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -H⁺   (d)C-------C\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate A: 3-deuterobenzyne)\n        ```\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.

This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker and break more quickly than C-D bonds).\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this pathway and remains in the molecule.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Although slower, it is still possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide anion (:NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position).\n    *   So, this pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This creates a carbanion at C2. Protonation by NH3 yields **aniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C2:** This creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 also yields **aniline**.\n    *   So, this pathway produces only one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified the following unique organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules are structurally distinct isomers. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n        *   The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n        *   This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium in this intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n    *   Pathway B yields one product: aniline.\n    *   Since all three of these molecules are structurally different, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted as 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways can occur, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: C-H bonds are broken more easily than C-D bonds, so this pathway is slower, but it still occurs).\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the benzyne triple bond.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the C1 position, the deuterium atom is at C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of this symmetric benzyne.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C2, which is then protonated. The product is **aniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C2:** The NH₂ group adds to C2. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The product is also **aniline**.\n\n        So, Pathway B leads to only one product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H+) from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D+) from C2 is also possible, although slower. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   C-2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C-6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-6.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C-1 position.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C-2.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-2.\n    3.  This intermediate eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C-1.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Importantly, since the deuterium atom was abstracted, this benzyne intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne** (it contains no deuterium).\n\nSo, we have two distinct benzyne intermediates forming concurrently: 3-deuteriobenzyne and unlabeled benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the highly reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.

Protonation of C-6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6, creating a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2, which are meta to each other).\n\n*   **Products from unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The amide ion attacks the symmetric benzyne. Attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by the solvent.

Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The structure is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, and then addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Reaction from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by ammonia (NH3) yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by ammonia yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Reaction from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is the simple, unsubstituted benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of the same product after protonation. The product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine (Br) atom is at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). This is a very strong base (amide ion, NH₂⁻) used in a polar solvent.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This forms a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This forms a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate** (regular benzyne).\n\n*   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and occurs faster than Pathway B (abstraction of D). However, both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n**4. Step 2: Addition (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon atom of the benzyne \"triple bond\".\n\n*   **Addition to the Deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C1. A negative charge forms on C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C6. A negative charge forms on C1, which is protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces **two different deuterated products**.\n\n*   **Addition to the Non-deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    *   This intermediate is simply benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2. Regardless of where it attacks, the subsequent protonation results in the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Thus, Pathway B produces **one non-deuterated product**.\n\n**5. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible initial elimination pathways, we identify three unique organic products that can be formed:\n\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n        *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the proton from C-6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  The carbanion intermediate quickly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you renumber the benzyne so the triple bond is between C1 and C2, the deuterium is on C3).\n\n        *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2.** Although slower than H-abstraction, this pathway is still possible.\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the deuteron from C-2, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium atom.\n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are possible: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Pathway A) and **benzyne** (from Pathway B).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the products from each intermediate:\n\n        *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Intermediate from Pathway A):**\n            *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6 (original numbering), and the deuterium is at C-2.\n            *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This places a negative charge on C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the -D is at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This places a negative charge on C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the -D is at C-2. Relative to the new -NH2 group, the deuterium is three carbons away. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   Thus, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n        *   **Products from benzyne (Intermediate from Pathway B):**\n            *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n            *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n            *   Thus, Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   By considering all possible, chemically reasonable pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n        1.  Aniline\n        2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n        3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n    The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. Sodium amide is a very strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction mechanism.**\n    This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate. Aromatic halides that lack strong electron-withdrawing groups do not undergo standard nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr). Instead, in the presence of a very strong base like NaNH2, they undergo elimination followed by addition.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the elimination step (formation of benzyne).**\n    The amide ion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    1.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    2.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    Both D at C2 and H at C6 can be abstracted by the amide ion, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2.**\n        The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is standard benzyne (C6H4), which has no deuterium.\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -D+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate A) Benzyne\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6.**\n        The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the benzene ring. The resulting intermediate is a deuterated benzyne, specifically 3-deuterobenzyne (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at position 2 relative to C1, which is position 3 on the new benzyne ring system).\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -H+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate B) 3-Deuterobenzyne\n\n    *Note on Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):* The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so abstraction of the proton from C6 (Pathway B) is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 (Pathway A). However, the question asks for the number of *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is favored.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the addition step for each benzyne intermediate.**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (Benzyne):**\n        Benzyne is symmetrical. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond. Both attacks, after protonation, lead to the same product: aniline.\n\n        Benzyne + NH2- -> Anion -> +NH3 -> **Product 1: Aniline (C6H5NH2)**\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (3-Deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is not symmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 at C6 yields 2-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are ortho to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C1; 2. Protonation)--> **Product 2: 2-Deuteroaniline**\n\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 at C1 yields 3-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are meta to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C6; 2. Protonation)--> **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\n    From the two possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** An aryl halide reacting with a strong base like sodium amide proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism. The intermediate in this reaction is a highly reactive species called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step):**\n    The amide anion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Since both positions are ortho to the bromine, abstraction from either is possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. This benzyne still contains the deuterium atom at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne I**.\n        *(Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this pathway is kinetically favored and will be the major route, but the question asks for all *possible* products).*\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n        2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a different benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule. Let's call this **Benzyne II**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step):**\n    The benzyne intermediates are then attacked by a nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne I (Deuterated):**\n        This benzyne is unsymmetrical. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When we re-number this molecule according to IUPAC rules (starting from the carbon with the -NH₂ group), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Benzyne I leads to two distinct, deuterated products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne II (Non-deuterated):**\n        This benzyne also has a triple bond between C1 and C2, but no deuterium. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 by the solvent NH₃ adds a regular hydrogen atom. The product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C2. A carbanion forms at C1, which is protonated by NH₃. The product is also **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Benzyne II leads to only one distinct product.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A, attack at C1)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A, attack at C6)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide (like 1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (like NaNH₂) proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, specifically involving a **benzyne** (or aryne) intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the ortho positions to C1 (which has Br) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. These two possibilities lead to two different reaction pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This is a slower process than abstracting H⁺ but is still a possible reaction pathway.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this benzyne intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The intermediate is unsymmetrical due to the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, the carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.

This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   The C6 position, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of a proton (H⁺) is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺). However, both reactions are possible. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n3.  **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway)**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This elimination results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where a new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway)**\n    *   Less frequently, the amide ion can remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   The resulting benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is a **non-deuterated benzyne**. The removed deuterium ends up forming deuterated ammonia (NH₂D).\n\n     \n\n5.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n6.  **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. Numbering the ring starting from the -NH₂ group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces two distinct isomers: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n     \n\n7.  **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne)**\n    *   The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2, but since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same initial carbanion (o-aminophenyl anion).\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n    *   The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   (Note: The aminophenyl anion could also be deuterated by the NH₂D formed in this pathway, which would lead to 2-deuterioaniline. However, this is a product already accounted for in Pathway A. The new, unique product from this pathway is aniline.)\n\n     \n\n8.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The reaction produces a mixture of three structurally distinct organic products:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.

Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at the adjacent position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (aryl halide with no activating groups, very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base, abstracting an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n**Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is weaker and is cleaved more readily than the C-D bond. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Consequently, Pathway A (H abstraction) will be significantly faster and thus the major pathway, while Pathway B (D abstraction) will be slower and the minor pathway. However, since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider all chemically feasible pathways, even the minor ones.\n\nTherefore, **two different benzyne intermediates** are formed in the reaction: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and unlabeled benzyne (minor).\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the newly formed benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) can also act as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with an -NH2 group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation yields a product with an -NH2 group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. To name this compound, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, so C6 becomes C1'. In this new numbering, the deuterium is at C3'. The product is **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) gives **two distinct products**.\n\n*   **Attack on unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. It is symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **1-aminobenzene** (or aniline).\n    *   Thus, the minor intermediate (benzyne) gives only **one product**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we get three unique organic molecules:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.  1-aminobenzene (aniline)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a classic problem involving the benzyne mechanism in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction to determine the number of possible products.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine (Br) at position C1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions: C6 (bearing a hydrogen, H) and C2 (bearing a deuterium, D). This leads to two competing pathways for the initial elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a **3-deuteriobenzyne** intermediate. The deuterium atom remains on the ring at position C2.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower but still occurs.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH2⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ attacks C1. The resulting carbanion is at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups are adjacent.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ attacks C6. The resulting carbanion is at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups have a meta relationship.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Summary of Products**\nBy considering both pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
