For a star to be observable from both observatories, its declination must be in a range visible from both locations.\n\n*   An observer at latitude `L` can theoretically observe stars with declination `δ` between `L - 90°` and `L + 90°`. However, for practical ground-based observations, the star must rise above the horizon.\n*   For Keck (latitude ≈ +20° N), the observable declination range is from `20 - 90 = -70°` to `+90°`.\n*   For Paranal (latitude ≈ -24° S), the observable declination range is from `-90°` to `-24 + 90 = +66°`.\n*   Therefore, to be visible from **both** observatories, a star must have a declination `δ` such that **-70° < δ < +66°**.\n\nThe second condition is the apparent brightness.\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\n*   To be detectable by **both**, a star must have an apparent V magnitude **m_V < 16**.\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on these two criteria: Declination and Apparent Magnitude.\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude (m_V), absolute magnitude (M_V), distance in parsecs (d), and extinction (A_V) is:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nThe extinction in the V band is given by `A_V = R_V * E(B-V)`, where `R_V = 3.1`.\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range for Keck Observatory (-70° to +90°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 55°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < 55° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** m_V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < 48° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < -48° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This is not brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 60°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < 60° < +66°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   A_V = 0 (no extinction mentioned)\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   m_V ≈ 15.0 mag. This is brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nOnly Star3 and Star5 meet both the declination and apparent magnitude criteria for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### **1. Re-evaluating Observability Criteria with Precise Latitudes**\n\nThe user has provided more precise latitudes. Let's update the declination limits based on this new information.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude (λ):** -24.6230° S\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory Latitude (λ):** +19.8264° N\n\nThe declination (δ) range for observability is determined by the condition that a star must rise above the horizon. Disregarding atmospheric refraction and telescope pointing limits, the formulas are:\n*   For a southern observatory (Paranal): `δ < 90° + λ` => `δ < 90° - 24.6230°` => `δ < 65.377°`\n*   For a northern observatory (Keck): `δ > λ - 90°` => `δ > 19.8264° - 90°` => `δ > -70.1736°`\n\n**Combined Declination Requirement:** A star must have a declination **δ** such that **-70.1736° < δ < +65.377°**.\n\n**Brightness Requirement:** As established before, the star's apparent V magnitude **m** must be less than 16 (`m < 16.0`) to be seen by the more restrictive HIRES spectrograph.\n\n### **2. Re-analyzing Each Star with Updated Criteria**\n\nWe will re-evaluate each star using these precise criteria. The apparent magnitude calculations from the previous step are still valid. We just need to check the results against the refined declination limits.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   Apparent Mag (m) = 15.5 (`< 16.0`, OK)\n    *   Declination (δ) = -75° (`< -70.1736°`, **FAIL**)\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   Apparent Mag (m) = 16.5 (`> 16.0`, **FAIL**)\n    *   Declination (δ) = 55° (`-70.1736° < 55° < 65.377°`, OK)\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   Apparent Mag (m) = 15.5 (`< 16.0`, **OK**)\n    *   Declination (δ) = 48° (`-70.1736° < 48° < 65.377°`, **OK**)\n    *   *Conclusion: Observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   Apparent Mag (m) = 16.74 (`> 16.0`, **FAIL**)\n    *   Declination (δ) = -48° (`-70.1736° < -48° < 65.377°`, OK)\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   Apparent Mag (m) = 15.0 (`< 16.0`, **OK**)\n    *   Declination (δ) = 60° (`-70.1736° < 60° < 65.377°`, **OK**)\n    *   *Conclusion: Observable by both.*\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis confirms that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the brightness and declination requirements to be observed by the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe analysis is complete. The Python code has confirmed the step-by-step reasoning. Here is a summary of the findings for each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:** Its declination of -75° is too far south to be seen from the Keck Observatory (minimum DEC ≈ -70.2°). Therefore, it cannot be observed by both.\n*   **Star 2:** While it is visible from both observatories, its apparent magnitude of 16.5 mag is fainter than the 16 mag limit of the HIRES spectrograph. Therefore, it cannot be detected by both.\n*   **Star 3:** Its declination of +48° is within the common visibility range of both observatories. Its apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is brighter than the required limit of 16 mag. Therefore, **it can be detected by both**.\n*   **Star 4:** Although it is visible from both observatories, its calculated apparent magnitude, after accounting for interstellar extinction, is 16.74 mag (`m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 3.1*0.4 = 16.74`). This is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph. Therefore, it cannot be detected by both.\n*   **Star 5:** Its declination of +60° is within the common visibility range. Its calculated apparent magnitude is approximately 15.0 mag (`m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 14.99`). This is bright enough for both instruments. Therefore, **it can be detected by both**.\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Observability Criteria**\n\nA star must satisfy two conditions to be detected by both spectrographs:\n*   **Visibility Criterion:** It must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n*   **Brightness Criterion:** Its apparent magnitude must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of *both* instruments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThe problem states to disregard pointing limits, so we consider a star visible if it ever rises above the horizon. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude:** Approx. 24.6° S (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than (Latitude - 90°), so DEC > (-24.6° - 90°) = -114.6°. Since declination only ranges from -90° to +90°, any star is theoretically visible from Paranal.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory Latitude:** Approx. 19.8° N (+19.8°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than (Latitude - 90°), so DEC > (19.8° - 90°) = -70.2°.\n\nFor a star to be seen from **both** locations, it must satisfy the more restrictive condition, which is the one from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Combined Visibility Rule: DEC > -70.2°**\n\n**3. Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17.\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16.\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES).\n*   **Combined Brightness Rule: m_V < 16.0**\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against the two rules: `DEC > -70.2°` and `m_V < 16.0`.\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude is not given, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10) + A_V`\nwhere `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n\n*   **Star 1:** DEC = -75°. This is **not visible** from Keck (since -75 < -70.2).\n*   **Star 2:** m_V = 16.5. This is **not bright enough** for HIRES (since 16.5 > 16.0).\n*   **Star 3:** DEC = 48° (Visible). m_V = 15.5 (Bright enough). This star **can be detected** by both.\n*   **Star 4:** Calculated m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(1) + (3.1*0.4) = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74. This is **not bright enough** for HIRES (since 16.74 > 16.0).\n*   **Star 5:** Calculated m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(0.5) + 0 = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995. DEC = 60° (Visible). m_V ≈ 15.0 (Bright enough). This star **can be detected** by both.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn object can be observed by a telescope if it is both visible in the sky from the observatory's location and bright enough for the telescope's instruments to detect.\n\n### **1. Visibility (Declination Limits)**\n\nFor a celestial object to be visible, it must rise above the observer's horizon. The range of declinations (DEC) visible from a given latitude is:\n`Latitude - 90° < DEC < Latitude + 90°`\n\nHowever, since we are considering observatories in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, a star must be visible from both locations.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Latitude: ~24.6° South (-24.6°)\n    *   Visible Range: -24.6° - 90° < DEC < -24.6° + 90° => **-114.6° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):**\n    *   Latitude: ~19.8° North (+19.8°)\n    *   Visible Range: +19.8° - 90° < DEC < +19.8° + 90° => **-70.2° < DEC < +109.8°**\n\n*   **Combined Visibility:** For a star to be seen from both observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range:\n    **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n### **2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\n\nA star must be brighter than the magnitude limit of both instruments.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17 mag\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16 mag\n\nTo be detected by both, the star must meet the stricter requirement: **m_V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Star**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_V) when the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the extinction in the V band (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n---\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **DEC = -75°**. This is outside the combined visibility range (-70.2° to +65.4°). It is not visible from Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Result: Not detectable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **DEC = +55°**. This is within the visibility range.\n    *   **m_V = 16.5 mag**. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n    *   **Result: Not detectable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **DEC = +48°**. This is within the visibility range.\n    *   **m_V = 15.5 mag**. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Result: Detectable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **DEC = -48°**. This is within the visibility range.\n    *   **Calculate m_V:**\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n    *   This is not brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Result: Not detectable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **DEC = +60°**. This is within the visibility range.\n    *   **Calculate m_V:**\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, A_V = 0 mag\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**\n    *   This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Result: Detectable by both.**\n\n---\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 satisfy both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe code output confirms the detailed reasoning. Here is a summary of the results for each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:** Fails the declination check. It is too far south to be seen from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n*   **Star 2:** Fails the magnitude check. At an apparent magnitude of 16.5, it is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph (which requires m_V < 16).\n*   **Star 3:** Passes both checks. Its apparent magnitude of 15.5 is brighter than 16, and its declination of +48° is visible from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n*   **Star 4:** Fails the magnitude check. Although its absolute magnitude is 15.5, interstellar dust adds 1.24 magnitudes of extinction (`3.1 * 0.4`), making its apparent magnitude 16.74. This is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Star 5:** Passes both checks. Its apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than 16, and its declination of +60° is visible from both observatories.\n\nTherefore, the only stars that can be detected by both instruments are **Star 3 and Star 5**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Final Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish Observational Criteria:**\n    *   **Visibility:** The first step was to determine the range of declinations (DEC) visible from both observatories.\n        *   Keck Observatory (Hawaii, Latitude ≈ +19.8° N): Can see stars with DEC > -70.2°.\n        *   Paranal Observatory (Chile, Latitude ≈ -24.6° S): Can see stars with DEC < +65.4°.\n        *   **Combined Requirement:** A star must have a declination in the range of **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°** to be seen by both.\n    *   **Brightness:** The second step was to determine the required brightness.\n        *   ESPRESSO (Paranal): Requires apparent magnitude V < 17.\n        *   HIRES (Keck): Requires apparent magnitude V < 16.\n        *   **Combined Requirement:** To be observed by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit: **V < 16**.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Star:**\n    The Python script's output confirms the following:\n\n    *   **Star 1:**\n        *   DEC = -75.0°. **Fails** visibility criterion.\n        *   V = 15.50.

Its declination of 48° is visible from both observatories, and its apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is bright enough for both spectrographs.\n*   **Star 4:** Is not observable. Although its declination is fine, after accounting for interstellar absorption, its apparent magnitude becomes 16.74 mag, which is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Star 5:** **Is observable**. Its declination of 60° is visible from both locations, and its calculated apparent magnitude of ~15.0 mag is bright enough for both instruments.\n\nTherefore, the two stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which stars satisfy two main criteria:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star must be visible in the sky from both the Paranal Observatory (Chile, Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory (Hawaii, Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Observability Criteria\n\n**a) Positional Visibility (Declination):**\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately -25° S. Ignoring atmospheric effects and terrain, it can observe stars with declinations (DEC) up to `90° - 25° = +65°`.\n*   **Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with declinations down to `20° - 90° = -70°`.\n*   **Combined Visibility:** For a star to be seen from both observatories, its declination must be within the shared range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** Can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (`m_V` < 17).\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** Can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (`m_V` < 16).\n*   **Combined Limit:** To be observed by both, a star must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the apparent magnitude must be **`m_V` < 16**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria.

Location (Observability from both sites):**\n- The Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ~24.6° S).\n- The W. M. Keck Observatory is located in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ~19.8° N).\n- A star is observable from a specific location if it rises above the horizon. The range of declinations (DEC) visible from an observatory at latitude `L` is given by the condition `DEC > L - 90°`.\n- For Paranal (L ≈ -24.6°): `DEC > -24.6° - 90° = -114.6°`. Since declination is always between -90° and +90°, any star is theoretically visible. However, realistically, stars are observable if `DEC < 90° - |L|`. So for Paranal, DEC < 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°.\n- For Keck (L ≈ +19.8°): `DEC > +19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n- For a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the overlapping range. The most restrictive conditions are `DEC < +65.4°` (from Paranal's northern limit) and `DEC > -70.2°` (from Keck's southern limit).\n- Therefore, the declination of the star must be approximately in the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n- ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17 (i.e., V < 17).\n- HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 16 (i.e., V < 16).\n- For a star to be observed by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **V < 16.0**.\n\nNow, let's analyze each star against these two criteria. We will calculate the apparent magnitude (V) for stars where it is not directly given, using the distance modulus formula:\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\nwhere:\n- `Mv` is the absolute V magnitude.\n- `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n- `Av` is the total extinction in the V band. `Av` is calculated as `3.1 * E(B-V)`. If `E(B-V)` is not given, we assume `Av = 0`.\n\n---\n**Analysis of each star:**\n\n**Star1:**\n- **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°). It is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n- **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star2:**\n- **Location:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star3:**\n- **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:**\n  - Given: `Mv` = not provided, `V_apparent` = 15.5 mag, `E(B-V)` = 0.6 mag.\n  - The apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is the observed brightness *after* extinction. Therefore, we use this value directly.\n  - V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star4:**\n- **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:**\n  - Given: `Mv` = 15.5 mag, `d` = 10 pc, `E(B-V)` = 0.4 mag.\n  - We need to calculate the apparent magnitude `V`.\n  - Extinction `Av` = 3.1 * `E(B-V)` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n  - `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\n  - `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24`\n  - `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) + 1.24`\n  - `V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n  - V = 16.74 mag. This is not brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star5:**\n- **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:**\n  - Given: `Mv` = 16.5 mag, `d` = 5 pc, no extinction mentioned (`Av = 0`).\n  - `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\n  - `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0`\n  - `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5)`\n  - `V = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301)`\n  - `V = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995` mag.\n  - V ≈ 15.0 mag. This is brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n---\n**Final Result:**\n- **Star3** can be detected by both observatories.\n- **Star5** can be detected by both observatories.\n\nThe correct option lists Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the conditions required for a star to be observable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs is as follows:\n\n### **1. Visibility Condition (Declination)**\n\nFor a star to be visible from an observatory, its declination must be within the range accessible from the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude ($\\phi$) of approximately -24.6°. A star is visible if its declination ($\\delta$) is greater than $\\phi - 90^\\circ$ and less than $90^\\circ - \\phi$. So for Paranal, the visible range is from $-114.6^\\circ$ to $+65.4^\\circ$. Since declination is always between -90° and +90°, the practical condition is **$\\delta < +65.4^\\circ$**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude ($\\phi$) of approximately +19.8°. The visible range for Keck is from $\\phi - 90^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ - \\phi$, which translates to a declination range of **$\\delta > -70.2^\\circ$**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must satisfy both conditions: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Brightness Condition (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\nA star's brightness must exceed the limiting magnitude of each instrument.\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) < 17.0\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) < 16.0\n\nTo be detected by *both*, the star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **$m_V < 16.0$**.\n\nWhen not given directly, the apparent magnitude ($m_V$) is calculated from the absolute magnitude ($M_V$), distance ($d$ in parsecs), and visual extinction ($A_V$) using the distance modulus formula:\n$m_V = M_V + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 + A_V$\nwhere $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V)$.\n\n### **Evaluation of Each Star**\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the visible range for the Keck Observatory (>-70.2°). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:** DEC = 55°. This is visible from both observatories. However, its apparent V magnitude is 16.5, which is fainter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:** DEC = 48°. This is visible from both observatories. Its apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, which is brighter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This is visible from both observatories. To check its brightness, we must calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   $M_V = 15.5$\n    *   $d = 10$ pc\n    *   $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V) = 3.1 \\times 0.4 = 1.24$\n    *   $m_V = 15.5 + 5 \\log_{10}(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74$\n    *   This magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:** DEC = 60°. This is visible from both observatories. We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   $M_V = 16.5$\n    *   $d = 5$ pc\n    *   $A_V = 0$ (as no extinction is mentioned)\n    *   $m_V = 16.5 + 5 \\log_{10}(5) - 5 + 0 \\approx 16.5 + 5(0.7) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = 15.0$\n    *   This magnitude (~15.0) is brighter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which stars are observable by both observatories, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be in a range visible from both observatories' latitudes.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the stricter of the two spectrographs' limits.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Observability Criteria**\n\n*   **Brightness Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (Paranal): `m_V` < 17.0 mag\n    *   HIRES (Keck): `m_V` < 16.0 mag\n    *   For a star to be seen by **both**, it must satisfy the more stringent limit. Therefore, the combined brightness requirement is **`m_V` < 16.0 mag**.\n\n*   **Visibility (Declination) Limit:**\n    A star is visible from an observatory if its declination (DEC) is within the range: `(observatory latitude - 90°) < DEC < (observatory latitude + 90°)`. In practice, a circumpolar star never sets, but for a star to be visible at all, it must rise above the horizon. The declination of a star that just grazes the horizon is `latitude - 90°` for the southern horizon and `90° - latitude` for the northern horizon.\n    *   **Paranal Observatory (Chile):** Latitude ≈ -24.6° S.\n        *   Visible declination range: (-24.6° - 90°) to (90° + (-24.6°)) = -114.6° to +65.4°.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nThe problem requires us to identify which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. For a star to be detectable by both, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility Condition**: It must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness Condition**: Its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of *both* instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observability Criteria\n\n**A. Visibility (Declination)**\nThe question asks us to disregard pointing limits and telescope altitude, so we only need to determine if a star rises above the horizon at each location. This is dictated by the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is north of the southern circumpolar region and south of the northern circumpolar region as seen from Paranal. The northernmost observable declination is `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. So, for Paranal, **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°). The southernmost observable declination is `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. So, for Keck, **DEC > -70.2°**.\n\nFor a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n**B. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., m_V < 17.0).\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (i.e., m_V < 16.0).\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the combined brightness requirement is:\n**m_V < 16.0**\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria. When the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given, we will calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `d` is distance in parsecs and `A_V` is absorption (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -75° is outside the required range (-70.2° to +65.4°). It is too far south for Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star2:** m_V = 16.5 mag, DEC = 55°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +55° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** m_V of 16.5 is *not* brighter than the limit of 16.0.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star3:** m_V = 15.5 mag, DEC = 48°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +48° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** The given apparent magnitude m_V = 15.5 is brighter than 16.0. (Pass)\n    *   **Result: PASS.**\n\n*   **Star4:** M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4, DEC = -48°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -48° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This value (16.74) is *not* brighter than 16.0.\n    *   **Result: FAIL.**\n\n*   **Star5:** M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, DEC = 60°\n    *   **Visibility Check:** +60° is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (assume no extinction as E(B-V) is not given).\n        *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This value (~15.0) is brighter than 16.0. (Pass)\n    *   **Result: PASS.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

For a star to be observable from both observatories, its declination must be in a range visible from both locations.\n\n*   An observer at latitude `L` can theoretically observe stars with declination `δ` between `L - 90°` and `L + 90°`. However, for practical ground-based observations, the star must rise above the horizon.\n*   For Keck (latitude ≈ +20° N), the observable declination range is from `20 - 90 = -70°` to `+90°`.\n*   For Paranal (latitude ≈ -24° S), the observable declination range is from `-90°` to `-24 + 90 = +66°`.\n*   Therefore, to be visible from **both** observatories, a star must have a declination `δ` such that **-70° < δ < +66°**.\n\nThe second condition is the apparent brightness.\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\n*   To be detectable by **both**, a star must have an apparent V magnitude **m_V < 16**.\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on these two criteria: Declination and Apparent Magnitude.\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude (m_V), absolute magnitude (M_V), distance in parsecs (d), and extinction (A_V) is:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nThe extinction in the V band is given by `A_V = R_V * E(B-V)`, where `R_V = 3.1`.\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°.

Re-evaluating Observability Criteria with Precise Latitudes**\n\nThe user has provided more precise latitudes. Let's update the declination limits based on this new information.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude (λ):** -24.6230° S\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory Latitude (λ):** +19.8264° N\n\nThe declination (δ) range for observability is determined by the condition that a star must rise above the horizon. Disregarding atmospheric refraction and telescope pointing limits, the formulas are:\n*   For a southern observatory (Paranal): `δ < 90° + λ` => `δ < 90° - 24.6230°` => `δ < 65.377°`\n*   For a northern observatory (Keck): `δ > λ - 90°` => `δ > 19.8264° - 90°` => `δ > -70.1736°`\n\n**Combined Declination Requirement:** A star must have a declination **δ** such that **-70.1736° < δ < +65.377°**.\n\n**Brightness Requirement:** As established before, the star's apparent V magnitude **m** must be less than 16 (`m < 16.0`) to be seen by the more restrictive HIRES spectrograph.\n\n### **2. Re-analyzing Each Star with Updated Criteria**\n\nWe will re-evaluate each star using these precise criteria. The apparent magnitude calculations from the previous step are still valid.

Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis confirms that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the brightness and declination requirements to be observed by the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe analysis is complete. The Python code has confirmed the step-by-step reasoning. Here is a summary of the findings for each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:** Its declination of -75° is too far south to be seen from the Keck Observatory (minimum DEC ≈ -70.2°). Therefore, it cannot be observed by both.\n*   **Star 2:** While it is visible from both observatories, its apparent magnitude of 16.5 mag is fainter than the 16 mag limit of the HIRES spectrograph. Therefore, it cannot be detected by both.\n*   **Star 3:** Its declination of +48° is within the common visibility range of both observatories. Its apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is brighter than the required limit of 16 mag. Therefore, **it can be detected by both**.\n*   **Star 4:** Although it is visible from both observatories, its calculated apparent magnitude, after accounting for interstellar extinction, is 16.74 mag (`m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 3.1*0.4 = 16.74`). This is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph. Therefore, it cannot be detected by both.\n*   **Star 5:** Its declination of +60° is within the common visibility range. Its calculated apparent magnitude is approximately 15.0 mag (`m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 14.99`). This is bright enough for both instruments. Therefore, **it can be detected by both**.\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Observability Criteria**\n\nA star must satisfy two conditions to be detected by both spectrographs:\n*   **Visibility Criterion:** It must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n*   **Brightness Criterion:** Its apparent magnitude must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of *both* instruments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Visibility Criterion**\n\nThe problem states to disregard pointing limits, so we consider a star visible if it ever rises above the horizon. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude:** Approx. 24.6° S (-24.6°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than (Latitude - 90°), so DEC > (-24.6° - 90°) = -114.6°. Since declination only ranges from -90° to +90°, any star is theoretically visible from Paranal.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory Latitude:** Approx. 19.8° N (+19.8°). A star is visible if its declination is greater than (Latitude - 90°), so DEC > (19.8° - 90°) = -70.2°.\n\nFor a star to be seen from **both** locations, it must satisfy the more restrictive condition, which is the one from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Combined Visibility Rule: DEC > -70.2°**\n\n**3. Analyze the Brightness Criterion**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17.\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16.\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES).\n*   **Combined Brightness Rule: m_V < 16.0**\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against the two rules: `DEC > -70.2°` and `m_V < 16.0`.\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude is not given, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10) + A_V`\nwhere `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n\n*   **Star 1:** DEC = -75°. This is **not visible** from Keck (since -75 < -70.2).\n*   **Star 2:** m_V = 16.5. This is **not bright enough** for HIRES (since 16.5 > 16.0).\n*   **Star 3:** DEC = 48° (Visible). m_V = 15.5 (Bright enough). This star **can be detected** by both.\n*   **Star 4:** Calculated m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(1) + (3.1*0.4) = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74. This is **not bright enough** for HIRES (since 16.74 > 16.0).\n*   **Star 5:** Calculated m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(0.5) + 0 = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995. DEC = 60° (Visible). m_V ≈ 15.0 (Bright enough). This star **can be detected** by both.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn object can be observed by a telescope if it is both visible in the sky from the observatory's location and bright enough for the telescope's instruments to detect.\n\n### **1. Visibility (Declination Limits)**\n\nFor a celestial object to be visible, it must rise above the observer's horizon. The range of declinations (DEC) visible from a given latitude is:\n`Latitude - 90° < DEC < Latitude + 90°`\n\nHowever, since we are considering observatories in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, a star must be visible from both locations.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Latitude: ~24.6° South (-24.6°)\n    *   Visible Range: -24.6° - 90° < DEC < -24.6° + 90° => **-114.6° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n*   **W.

Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit)**\n\nA star must be brighter than the magnitude limit of both instruments.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17 mag\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16 mag\n\nTo be detected by both, the star must meet the stricter requirement: **m_V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Star**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_V) when the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the extinction in the V band (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n---\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **DEC = -75°**.

Its declination of 60° is visible from both locations, and its calculated apparent magnitude of ~15.0 mag is bright enough for both instruments.\n\nTherefore, the two stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which stars satisfy two main criteria:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star must be visible in the sky from both the Paranal Observatory (Chile, Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory (Hawaii, Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Observability Criteria\n\n**a) Positional Visibility (Declination):**\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately -25° S. Ignoring atmospheric effects and terrain, it can observe stars with declinations (DEC) up to `90° - 25° = +65°`.\n*   **Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with declinations down to `20° - 90° = -70°`.\n*   **Combined Visibility:** For a star to be seen from both observatories, its declination must be within the shared range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** Can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (`m_V` < 17).\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** Can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (`m_V` < 16).\n*   **Combined Limit:** To be observed by both, a star must be bright enough for the less sensitive instrument (HIRES). Therefore, the apparent magnitude must be **`m_V` < 16**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria. For stars where the apparent magnitude isn't given, we will calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the extinction. The extinction is given by `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°\n    *   **Visibility:** -75° is outside the required range (-70° to +65°).

Location (Observability from both sites):**\n- The Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ~24.6° S).\n- The W. M. Keck Observatory is located in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ~19.8° N).\n- A star is observable from a specific location if it rises above the horizon. The range of declinations (DEC) visible from an observatory at latitude `L` is given by the condition `DEC > L - 90°`.\n- For Paranal (L ≈ -24.6°): `DEC > -24.6° - 90° = -114.6°`. Since declination is always between -90° and +90°, any star is theoretically visible. However, realistically, stars are observable if `DEC < 90° - |L|`. So for Paranal, DEC < 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°.\n- For Keck (L ≈ +19.8°): `DEC > +19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n- For a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the overlapping range. The most restrictive conditions are `DEC < +65.4°` (from Paranal's northern limit) and `DEC > -70.2°` (from Keck's southern limit).\n- Therefore, the declination of the star must be approximately in the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n- ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17 (i.e., V < 17).\n- HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 16 (i.e., V < 16).\n- For a star to be observed by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **V < 16.0**.\n\nNow, let's analyze each star against these two criteria. We will calculate the apparent magnitude (V) for stars where it is not directly given, using the distance modulus formula:\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\nwhere:\n- `Mv` is the absolute V magnitude.\n- `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n- `Av` is the total extinction in the V band. `Av` is calculated as `3.1 * E(B-V)`. If `E(B-V)` is not given, we assume `Av = 0`.\n\n---\n**Analysis of each star:**\n\n**Star1:**\n- **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°). It is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n- **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star2:**\n- **Location:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star3:**\n- **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:**\n  - Given: `Mv` = not provided, `V_apparent` = 15.5 mag, `E(B-V)` = 0.6 mag.\n  - The apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is the observed brightness *after* extinction. Therefore, we use this value directly.\n  - V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star4:**\n- **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:**\n  - Given: `Mv` = 15.5 mag, `d` = 10 pc, `E(B-V)` = 0.4 mag.\n  - We need to calculate the apparent magnitude `V`.\n  - Extinction `Av` = 3.1 * `E(B-V)` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n  - `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\n  - `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24`\n  - `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) + 1.24`\n  - `V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n  - V = 16.74 mag. This is not brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star5:**\n- **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range.\n- **Brightness:**\n  - Given: `Mv` = 16.5 mag, `d` = 5 pc, no extinction mentioned (`Av = 0`).\n  - `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d/10) + Av`\n  - `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0`\n  - `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5)`\n  - `V = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301)`\n  - `V = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995` mag.\n  - V ≈ 15.0 mag. This is brighter than 16.0.\n- **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n---\n**Final Result:**\n- **Star3** can be detected by both observatories.\n- **Star5** can be detected by both observatories.\n\nThe correct option lists Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the conditions required for a star to be observable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs is as follows:\n\n### **1. Visibility Condition (Declination)**\n\nFor a star to be visible from an observatory, its declination must be within the range accessible from the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude ($\\phi$) of approximately -24.6°. A star is visible if its declination ($\\delta$) is greater than $\\phi - 90^\\circ$ and less than $90^\\circ - \\phi$. So for Paranal, the visible range is from $-114.6^\\circ$ to $+65.4^\\circ$. Since declination is always between -90° and +90°, the practical condition is **$\\delta < +65.4^\\circ$**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude ($\\phi$) of approximately +19.8°. The visible range for Keck is from $\\phi - 90^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ - \\phi$, which translates to a declination range of **$\\delta > -70.2^\\circ$**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must satisfy both conditions: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Brightness Condition (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\nA star's brightness must exceed the limiting magnitude of each instrument.\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) < 17.0\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) < 16.0\n\nTo be detected by *both*, the star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **$m_V < 16.0$**.\n\nWhen not given directly, the apparent magnitude ($m_V$) is calculated from the absolute magnitude ($M_V$), distance ($d$ in parsecs), and visual extinction ($A_V$) using the distance modulus formula:\n$m_V = M_V + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 + A_V$\nwhere $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V)$.\n\n### **Evaluation of Each Star**\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°.

However, its apparent V magnitude is 16.5, which is fainter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:** DEC = 48°. This is visible from both observatories. Its apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, which is brighter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This is visible from both observatories. To check its brightness, we must calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   $M_V = 15.5$\n    *   $d = 10$ pc\n    *   $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V) = 3.1 \\times 0.4 = 1.24$\n    *   $m_V = 15.5 + 5 \\log_{10}(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74$\n    *   This magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:** DEC = 60°. This is visible from both observatories. We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   $M_V = 16.5$\n    *   $d = 5$ pc\n    *   $A_V = 0$ (as no extinction is mentioned)\n    *   $m_V = 16.5 + 5 \\log_{10}(5) - 5 + 0 \\approx 16.5 + 5(0.7) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = 15.0$\n    *   This magnitude (~15.0) is brighter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which stars are observable by both observatories, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be in a range visible from both observatories' latitudes.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the stricter of the two spectrographs' limits.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Observability Criteria**\n\n*   **Brightness Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (Paranal): `m_V` < 17.0 mag\n    *   HIRES (Keck): `m_V` < 16.0 mag\n    *   For a star to be seen by **both**, it must satisfy the more stringent limit.

In practice, a circumpolar star never sets, but for a star to be visible at all, it must rise above the horizon. The declination of a star that just grazes the horizon is `latitude - 90°` for the southern horizon and `90° - latitude` for the northern horizon.\n    *   **Paranal Observatory (Chile):** Latitude ≈ -24.6° S.\n        *   Visible declination range: (-24.6° - 90°) to (90° + (-24.6°)) = -114.6° to +65.4°.
