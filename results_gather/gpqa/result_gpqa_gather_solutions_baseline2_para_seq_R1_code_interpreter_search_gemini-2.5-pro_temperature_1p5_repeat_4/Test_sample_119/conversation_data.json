This is a crucial assumption, which means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relating Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance.\n\n3.  **Considering a Volume of Space:** Let's think about the number of stars up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n4.  **Counting Stars in a Shell:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This is a density function. To find it, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere times its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4πd²) * dd`\n    *   Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n        `dN = n * dV = n * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Expressing in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding small range in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n        `d(d) / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The term `dN / d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `n` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that the distance `d` can be expressed in terms of parallax as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Consider a sphere centered on the observer (Earth) with a radius `d`. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    The total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    Since `ρ`, `π`, and `4/3` are constants, the number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    `N ∝ d^3`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    We want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd^2`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 * dd`\n    This gives us the number of stars in a specific distance range `[d, d + dd]`.\n\n5.  **Convert the expression to be in terms of parallax.**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx^4`\n    The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the corresponding distance `d` decreases, so we are looking at a shell closer to us. The density, or the number of stars in a given small range of parallax, is a positive quantity. We are interested in how the magnitude of this number changes with `plx`.\n    The magnitude is:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx^4`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between key variables:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d` to a star. We can write this relationship as `plx = k/d` or, for simplicity in astronomical units, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars `N` up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume `V` of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`.\n    *   This equation gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since smaller distance `d` corresponds to larger parallax `plx`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`. This is a differential quantity, which can be expressed as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4πρ/3) * plx⁻³ ]`\n    *   Applying the power rule for differentiation `d(xⁿ)/dx = nxⁿ⁻¹`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = -4πρ / plx⁴`.\n\n5.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the cumulative number of stars `N` decreases (which is correct according to our definition of N as the number of stars *beyond* a certain parallax). However, the question is about the number of stars *in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity. So we are interested in the magnitude.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\n    Our derived relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant everywhere in space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that the distance to a star can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Formulate the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find how the quantity `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. The shell is at a distance `d` and has a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Translate from Distance to Parallax:**\n    Now, we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` instead of `d`. We have two substitutions to make:\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Second, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars in a given range (which is always positive), we can consider the magnitude:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Star Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (where parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs).\n\n2.  **Count stars in a thin shell of space:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on parallax (`plx`).\n    *   We need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are only interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the star count equation:**\n    *   We start with our equation for the number of stars in the shell: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into this equation.\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This is a crucial starting point. A uniform distribution means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (the Sun). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The total number of stars (`N`) within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance (`N ∝ d³`).\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    From this, we can express the distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is a rate, which in calculus terms means a derivative. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the inner sphere (`4πd²`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the shell's volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Change Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Now we need to express `dN` in terms of parallax `plx`. We have the relationships:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. We can write this relationship as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/d` or `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n    For simplicity, let's use the standard definition where `d = 1/plx` (with `d` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Use the assumption of uniform star distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    The number of stars (`N`) within a spherical volume of radius `d` is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `V`.\n    The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    So, the number of stars out to a distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax.**\n    Now, substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N(d)`. This will give us `N(plx)`, the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (which corresponds to stars with a distance *less than or equal to* `d`).\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`\n\n5.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is the differential number count, which can be found by differentiating `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this distribution `n(plx)`. The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN = n(plx) * d(plx)`.\n    So, `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)|`. We take the absolute value because the number of stars must be a positive quantity, and the derivative will be negative (since `N(plx)` decreases as `plx` increases).\n\n    Let's perform the differentiation:\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n    Now, taking the absolute value:\n    `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Analyze the final relationship.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `n(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4πρ` is a constant.\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Number of stars in a volume:** The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is given by `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Relating Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star.

We can do this by considering a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell `dV` is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area of Sphere) * (thickness)`\n        `dV = (4πd²) * dd`\n\n5.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` within this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n6.  **Express everything in terms of Parallax (`plx`):** The question asks for the relationship with parallax, so we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship between the infinitesimals: `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases.

We need to substitute for both `d` and `dd` in the equation from Step 2.\n    *   The term `d²` becomes `(1/plx)²`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate the distance-parallax relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship between the differential intervals: `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are counting stars (a positive quantity), we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substitution and Final Proportionality:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    \n    Combining the terms with `plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the final equation:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we find the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This matches option A.\n\nA review of the candidate answers reveals that almost all of them perform this derivation correctly. However, many of them incorrectly map their correct result (`1/plx⁴`) to the wrong letter choice. The derivation itself is sound and consistently points to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This is a crucial assumption, which means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relating Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance.\n\n3.  **Considering a Volume of Space:** Let's think about the number of stars up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n4.  **Counting Stars in a Shell:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This is a density function. To find it, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere times its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4πd²) * dd`\n    *   Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n        `dN = n * dV = n * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Expressing in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding small range in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n        `d(d) / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The term `dN / d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `n` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that the distance `d` can be expressed in terms of parallax as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Consider a sphere centered on the observer (Earth) with a radius `d`. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    The total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    Since `ρ`, `π`, and `4/3` are constants, the number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    `N ∝ d^3`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    We want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd^2`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 * dd`\n    This gives us the number of stars in a specific distance range `[d, d + dd]`.\n\n5.  **Convert the expression to be in terms of parallax.**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx^4`\n    The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the corresponding distance `d` decreases, so we are looking at a shell closer to us. The density, or the number of stars in a given small range of parallax, is a positive quantity. We are interested in how the magnitude of this number changes with `plx`.\n    The magnitude is:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx^4`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between key variables:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d` to a star. We can write this relationship as `plx = k/d` or, for simplicity in astronomical units, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars `N` up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume `V` of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`.\n    *   This equation gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since smaller distance `d` corresponds to larger parallax `plx`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`. This is a differential quantity, which can be expressed as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4πρ/3) * plx⁻³ ]`\n    *   Applying the power rule for differentiation `d(xⁿ)/dx = nxⁿ⁻¹`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = -4πρ / plx⁴`.\n\n5.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the cumulative number of stars `N` decreases (which is correct according to our definition of N as the number of stars *beyond* a certain parallax). However, the question is about the number of stars *in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity. So we are interested in the magnitude.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\n    Our derived relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant everywhere in space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that the distance to a star can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Formulate the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find how the quantity `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. The shell is at a distance `d` and has a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Translate from Distance to Parallax:**\n    Now, we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` instead of `d`. We have two substitutions to make:\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Second, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars in a given range (which is always positive), we can consider the magnitude:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Star Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (where parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs).\n\n2.  **Count stars in a thin shell of space:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on parallax (`plx`).\n    *   We need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.

This is a crucial starting point. A uniform distribution means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (the Sun). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The total number of stars (`N`) within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance (`N ∝ d³`).\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    From this, we can express the distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is a rate, which in calculus terms means a derivative. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the inner sphere (`4πd²`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the shell's volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Change Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Now we need to express `dN` in terms of parallax `plx`. We have the relationships:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star.

This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    The number of stars (`N`) within a spherical volume of radius `d` is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `V`.\n    The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    So, the number of stars out to a distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax.**\n    Now, substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N(d)`. This will give us `N(plx)`, the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (which corresponds to stars with a distance *less than or equal to* `d`).\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`\n\n5.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is the differential number count, which can be found by differentiating `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this distribution `n(plx)`. The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN = n(plx) * d(plx)`.\n    So, `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)|`. We take the absolute value because the number of stars must be a positive quantity, and the derivative will be negative (since `N(plx)` decreases as `plx` increases).\n\n    Let's perform the differentiation:\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n    Now, taking the absolute value:\n    `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Analyze the final relationship.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `n(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4πρ` is a constant.\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky.

For counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n7.  **Substitute into the `dN` equation:** Now we replace `d` and `dd` in our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\".

So, we'll use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n    3.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        *   Simplifying this gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n    4.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n        *   From the equation in the previous step, we can rearrange to get: `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
