While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, the combination of acetic anhydride, pyridine, and Br2 achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride likely forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which enolizes more readily. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. These α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. Since the chain has 5 carbons, a stable 6-membered ring is formed. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt), C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It belongs to the C1 point group.\n\n2.  **Chemically Distinct Protons:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons are chemically non-equivalent unless they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying a theoretical count.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1). The chiral center is four bonds away (-CH₂-O-C(=O)-C₁). In a strict theoretical sense, they are in different chemical environments and should give **2 distinct signals**. However, in introductory and intermediate level problems, it is a common simplification to consider diastereotopic protons on a flexible side chain distant from the chiral center as being practically equivalent (isochronous) and giving a single signal. Let's evaluate both possibilities.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (CH₂) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH₂ groups are non-equivalent.\n    *   Within each CH₂ group in the chiral ring, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups will contribute 2 distinct proton signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n\n*   **Strict Theoretical Count:** 1 (from CH₃) + 2 (from diastereotopic -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **13 signals**.\n*   This number is not among the options (A) 5, B) 10, C) 8, D) 12).\n\n*   **Count with Common Simplification:** The options provided suggest that a simplification is expected. The most reasonable one is to treat the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's -OCH₂- as having the same chemical shift, as their non-equivalence is often small due to distance and flexibility.\n    *   If we count the -OCH₂- protons as one signal:\n    *   Total signals = 1 (from CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D. The parenthetical note in the question is slightly ambiguous, but the available choices strongly point toward this interpretation, where the clear and significant non-equivalence of the 10 ring protons is counted, but the minor non-equivalence of the side-chain methylene protons is ignored.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, functionally similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-protons of acetic acid are substituted by bromine.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by a double alkylation (the second being intramolecular).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a stable carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule:\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion at one end of the chain attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end, closing a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:**\n    1.  Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. To minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions), the ring will predominantly exist in the chair conformation where the bulky -COOCH2CH3 group is in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group is in the axial position.\n    2.  This conformational preference is strong, so the ring can be considered \"locked\" and not undergoing rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n    3.  In this locked conformation, the molecule is **chiral**. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, all ten protons on the five CH₂ groups of the cyclohexane ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments. The axial and equatorial protons at each position are different (diastereotopic), and no two positions are equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 is not equivalent to C6). Therefore, there are **10 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation about the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the complex chiral environment of the ring. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct. However, in many introductory NMR problems, such diastereotopic protons in a flexible side chain are often simplified and treated as equivalent, producing a single signal (a quartet). If we apply this common simplification, the methylene group gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the rigorous analysis of the locked, chiral ring structure (10 signals) and applying the common simplification for the ethyl group (2 signals: one for -CH₂- and one for -CH₃-), the total number of observable signals is:\n    *   10 (ring) + 1 (-CH₂) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches one of the given options. The alternative, assuming rapid ring flipping, would lead to 5 signals, which is less likely given the steric bulk on C1 and the phrasing of the question emphasizing chemical distinctness. The fully rigorous count (13 signals, by not simplifying the ethyl group) is not an option. Thus, 12 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups. This forms an enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  Since excess NaH is used, this intermediate is also deprotonated at the α-carbon, forming a new enolate: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]-.\n    4.  This enolate then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals are very close.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Symmetry:**\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. On the NMR timescale, this results in a time-averaged structure.\n*   Because the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule is strictly chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n*   However, for the purpose of analyzing NMR spectra in introductory problems, we often assume free rotation of the ester group, which creates an \"effective\" or \"time-averaged\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Let's proceed with this standard simplification, as analyzing the molecule as strictly chiral leads to 13 signals, which is not an option.\n*   This effective plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to the effective symmetry plane), the local environment is asymmetric due to proximity to the complex ring structure (C1 is a prochiral center). Replacement of one proton versus the other with a test group would create diastereomers. Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry passes through the C4 atom and bisects the H-C-H angle. Protons related by a plane of symmetry are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal** for the two C4 protons.\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (the \"axial-like\" and \"equatorial-like\" protons) are not related by any symmetry element and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one is cis to the cyano group, the other is trans, averaged over conformations). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The protons on C6 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 case, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for CH2) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H2) + 2 (for C2/C6-H2) + 2 (for C3/C5-H2) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the specific reagents are a variation, the fundamental reaction is similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions, similar to a malonic ester synthesis, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic. The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n    C(1)-------COOCH2CH3\n   /   \\\n  C(2)---C(6)\n /         \\\nC(3)-------C(5)\n \\         /\n   ---C(4)---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes certain pairs of atoms and protons equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Topicity and Chemical Equivalence:** We need to identify sets of protons that are chemically equivalent. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation or by rapid conformational changes. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct (non-equivalent).\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are non-equivalent and give distinct NMR signals.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. They are adjacent to a prochiral quaternary carbon (C1) and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring (-C6H10-):** We assume rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature.\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions (4H):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" and the other \"trans\" relative to the substituents on C1). Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C6, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions (4H):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5 due to symmetry. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position (2H):** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are interchanged by reflection through this plane. This makes them enantiotopic. In an achiral solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nEach of these 8 sets of protons is chemically distinct, leading to 8 observable signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 4.**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   The alpha-carbon is the methyl carbon. Bromination occurs at this position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n    *   Reactants: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH) and ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   The carboxyl group is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Ethyl cyanoacetate has two acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups (the alpha-carbon).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    *   The problem presents two main possibilities for the subsequent alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br):\n        *   **Path A (Intramolecular):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. The resulting intermediate is then deprotonated again by the excess NaH, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the pentyl chain. This forms a 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction). The product would be **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n        *   **Path B (Intermolecular):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This would be favored under high concentrations of the enolate. The product would be a dimer: **(EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)**.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR signals for both potential products to see which one matches the given options.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential product.**\n\n*   **Analysis for Path A Product (ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, -C₂H₄- ring segment, and -C₂H₄- other ring segment). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. There are no planes or centers of symmetry.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃ group are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH₂- group are adjacent to a stereocenter (via the ester linkage). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all five CH₂ groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (axial and equatorial in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups gives rise to 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path A product = 1 (CH₃) + 2 (CH₂) + 10 (ring) = 13 signals.** This number is not among the options (A=8, B=10, C=5, D=12). This suggests that either this product is incorrect, or a simplifying assumption is being made.\n\n*   **Analysis for Path B Product ((EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)):**\n    *   This reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). For NMR analysis, we often consider the most symmetric species, the meso compound, which can simplify the spectrum.\n    *   **Symmetry of the meso-(R,S) isomer:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group of the five-carbon chain. This symmetry makes corresponding groups on either side of the axis equivalent.\n    *   Let's label the chain: (end-group-A)-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2')-CH₂(1')-(end-group-A).\n    *   **End groups (-CH(CN)COOEt):** The two end groups are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The two α-protons (-CH) are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH₂ protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center. The two CH₃ groups are equivalent. So, we get **2 signals** from the CH₂ groups and **1 signal** from the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Pentane chain protons (- (CH₂)₅ -):**\n        *   The central CH₂(3) group is unique. Its two geminal protons are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(2) and CH₂(2') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(1) and CH₂(1') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path B meso product = [1(α-H) + 2(Et-CH₂) + 1(Et-CH₃)] + [2(C3) + 2(C2/2') + 2(C1/1')] = 4 + 6 = 10 signals.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe intramolecular cyclization (Path A) leads to a product with 13 theoretical ¹H NMR signals, which is not an option. The intermolecular dimerization (Path B), when analyzing the symmetric meso-diastereomer, leads to a product with 10 distinct ¹H NMR signals. Since 10 is one of the given options, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis and the structure of the final product to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes bromination at the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** One hydrogen on the alpha-carbon (the methyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Starting material:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (acid catalyst). This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Starting material:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine atom via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group (-CN).\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Starting material:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3). This molecule has an \"active methylene\" group (-CH2-) flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group), making its protons acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom. This is the first alkylation.\n        Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures that the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of this intermediate is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    4.  This new enolate then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with the cyano and ethyl ester groups attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. Due to this and rotation around the single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon in the ring (C4), the cyano group, and the ester functional group. This makes the molecule, on average, achiral.\n    *   This plane of symmetry means that C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral, the steric and electronic environment near the complex C1 substituent is asymmetric enough to make the two protons magnetically non-equivalent. They will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are mirror images of each other. They are enantiotopic and therefore chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" on average) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** Similar to C3/C5, these two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. The four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H) + 2 (for C3/C5-H) + 2 (for C2/C6-H) = 5 signals.\n    *   Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = **8**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is intended to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acidic protons are on the α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromine will substitute one of these hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are highly acidic because they are flanked by two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group, -CN, and the ester group, -COOEt). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon as well.\n        `NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable because it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl ester group attached to the same carbon (C1). The name of the compound is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n     /\nC(1)--COOCH₂CH₃\n |  \\\nC(6)-C(2)\n|    |\nC(5)-C(3)\n \\  /\n  C(4)\n```\n\nWe look for chemical equivalence based on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in time-averaged environments. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C6. However, on any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons are not equivalent. They are *diastereotopic* because C1 is a prochiral center. Therefore, they will have different chemical shifts. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 itself are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons are also diastereotopic. One is on one side of the ring relative to the substituents on C1, and the other is on the other side. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n    *   Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = 8 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Elucidating the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1:**\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic anhydride likely serves to form an acyl bromide intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base.\n    *   Reactant: CH3-COOH\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heat → Product 2:**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH3CH2OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n    *   Product 3: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH, then 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:**\n    *   This is a multi-step process within one reaction vessel.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from ethyl cyanoacetate. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) group and the ester (-COOEt) group.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **b. First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation, which still has one acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n        *   (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **d. Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring (the alpha-carbon + the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The chemical name is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n           CN\n          /\n     (C1)----COOCH2CH3\n    /   \\\n H2C(C2)--CH2(C6)\n/           \\\nH2C(C3)         CH2(C5)\n\\           /\n ----CH2(C4)----\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, due to rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule possesses an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester's C=O and ether oxygen.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        1.  **-CH₃ protons:** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n        2.  **-OCH₂- protons:** The C1 carbon is a prochiral center (it is attached to four different groups if we consider the ring pathways). Therefore, the two methylene hydrogens of the ethyl group are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:**\n        3.  **C2 and C6 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, on C2 itself, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation). Thus, there is one set of two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C6) and another set of two equivalent protons (the other one on C2, the other on C6). **(2 signals)**\n        4.  **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives two distinct signals from these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        5.  **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The plane bisects the H-C4-H angle, making the two protons on C4 mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are homotopic and chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = 8**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the typical Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions use PBr3, these reagents also accomplish the bromination at the α-carbon. Acetic anhydride may form a mixed anhydride or an enol acetate intermediate, which is then brominated. Pyridine acts as a base and/or catalyst.\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion (Br-).\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound. The α-hydrogens of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon: NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile, 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two main possibilities for the final product, depending on the reaction pathway which is influenced by stoichiometry and reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Intramolecular Cyclization:**\n    1.  Mono-alkylation: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    2.  With excess NaH, this intermediate is deprotonated again: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    3.  This anion undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a stable 6-membered ring. This is a very common and efficient way to synthesize carbocycles.\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure A):** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Intermolecular Dimerization:**\n    1.  Two equivalents of the enolate react with one equivalent of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    2.  2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt).\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure B):** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate.\n\n*   **Which product is formed?** Pathway A (cyclization) is generally the major product for forming 5- and 6-membered rings. However, the exact outcome can depend on conditions. Let's analyze the NMR signals for both possibilities.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis**\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (Cyclohexane derivative):**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation because the two substituents on C1 are different. The molecule belongs to the C1 point group.\n*   **Signal Counting:** In a molecule with no symmetry (C1 point group), all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent due to free rotation. → **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -O-CH2- group are adjacent to an asymmetric quaternary carbon (C1). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring (-CH2-)5:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no symmetry.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. → **10 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure A:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 10 (ring) = **13 signals**. This is not among the options. Let's consider plausible simplifications. If the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's CH2 were accidentally equivalent (isochronous), the total would be 12 signals (Option B).\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (Dimer):**\n*   **Structure:** (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt). Let's denote the chain as X-(CH2a)-(CH2b)-(CH2c)-(CH2b')-(CH2a')-X, where X is the CH(CN)COOEt group. This molecule can exist as a racemic pair (d,l diastereomers) and a meso compound. Both forms give the same number of signals in an achiral NMR solvent.\n*   **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the racemic (d,l) form, which has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the central carbon (Cc) of the pentyl chain. This axis makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n*   **Signal Counting:**\n    *   **The two X groups (CH(CN)COOEt) are equivalent.**\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n            *   The six methyl (-CH3) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n            *   The four methylene (-O-CH2-) protons belong to two equivalent groups. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (adjacent to a chiral center). → **2 signals**.\n        *   The two methine (-CH(CN)) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n    *   **The pentamethylene bridge -(CH2)5-:**\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'a' and 'a'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'a' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'b' and 'b'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'b' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2 group 'c' is unique. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure B:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2a) + 2 (CH2b) + 2 (CH2c) = **10 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the dimer (Structure B) leads to exactly 10 distinct hydrogen signals, which matches option A. While the cyclohexane (Structure A) is arguably the more probable chemical product, a rigorous count of its signals (13) does not match any option. To make it match, one would need to assume accidental equivalence of signals (e.g., getting 12 signals, Option B). Since the dimer product is also a chemically plausible outcome and its theoretical NMR signal count perfectly matches one of the answers without any further assumptions, it is the most likely intended answer for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step reaction analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction selectively brominates the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the hydrogens on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification. A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon bearing the bromine is a primary carbon, ideal for SN2.\n    *   **Product 3:** The cyanide group replaces the bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an intramolecular dialkylation of an active methylene compound.\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate): `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation. Intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`.\n        *   The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: `[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻`.\n        *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\n\nThe molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group. At room temperature, due to fast chair-chair interconversion and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (on average).\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The right side and left side of the ring are equivalent.\n*   Carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C6.\n*   Carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe will count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal** (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are isochronous (have the same chemical shift). They will produce **1 signal** (a quartet).\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    In a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on a given CH2 group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give separate signals.\n\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C2/C6 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C3/C5 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.\n        *   The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic. Their chemical environments are different.\n        *   The single axial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The single equatorial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C4 position)\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 6 = **8**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon bonded to bromine and displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Reaction analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester carbonyl). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the remaining acidic α-proton on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The carbanion within this intermediate now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This reaction forms a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product. Chemical non-equivalence is determined by the absence of symmetry operations (like planes or axes of symmetry) that can interchange protons.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is attached to two different substituents: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the different types of protons:\n\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This breaks any potential plane of symmetry that would pass through the C1-C4 axis of the ring.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry, the carbons on one side of the ring are not equivalent to the carbons on the other side.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n    *   This gives us 5 distinct methylene (-CH₂-) groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Now, we must consider the protons on each methylene group. In a cyclohexane ring, the two geminal protons on a single carbon atom (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule) and thus are chemically distinct.\n    *   The most rigorous count gives 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 distinct methylene groups. This would lead to 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   However, at room temperature, many substituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons. If we assume this fast-flipping model, each of the 5 distinct methylene groups gives rise to one time-averaged signal.\n    *   Under the fast-flipping assumption, the ring protons contribute **5 signals**.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The C1 carbon of the ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH₂CH₃, and the two different paths around the ring (-C2-C3... and -C6-C5...). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group of the ethyl ester is adjacent to this chiral center. Protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two separate signals.\n    *   The methyl (-CH₃) group has three equivalent protons due to free rotation, which give one signal.\n    *   Therefore, a strict analysis of the ethyl group yields 2 signals from the -OCH₂- protons and 1 signal from the -CH₃ protons, for a total of **3 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nCombining the two simplifying assumptions that are most common for such problems at room temperature:\n*   Fast ring-flipping model for the cyclohexane ring: **5 signals**.\n*   Strict diastereotopicity model for the ethyl group attached to a chiral center: **3 signals**.\n\nTotal signals = 5 (from ring) + 3 (from ethyl) = **8**.\n\nLet's quickly check other possibilities. If we assumed a locked ring (10 signals) and a simplified ethyl group (2 signals, ignoring diastereotopicity), we would get 12 signals. However, it's inconsistent to assume the ring is chiral (giving 10 distinct signals) while ignoring the consequence of that chirality on the adjacent ethyl group. The analysis leading to 8 signals is more self-consistent under common simplifying physical assumptions (fast flipping). The fact that an alternative, more complex symmetry argument also leads to 8 reinforces this conclusion.\n\nThus, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by alkylation, then a second deprotonation followed by intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic protons from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is still base present to remove the second, remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion is in the same molecule as a good leaving group (Br). Intramolecular SN2 reactions to form stable 5- or 6-membered rings are very fast. Here, the alpha-carbon attacks the terminal carbon of the 5-carbon chain, closing a 6-membered ring. This is a type of Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n2.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   Substituted cyclohexanes exist predominantly in chair conformations. Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the two possible chair conformations are diastereomers (not enantiomers).\n        *   **Conformer A:** Cyano group axial, ethoxycarbonyl group equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B:** Cyano group equatorial, ethoxycarbonyl group axial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is sterically bulkier than the cyano group. Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and the two conformers are not equally populated at equilibrium.\n    *   At room temperature, the interconversion (chair flip) between these two diastereomeric conformers is very rapid on the 1H NMR timescale. The observed spectrum is a weighted average of the spectra of the two individual conformers.\n3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:**\n    *   A simplified analysis might assume a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This would make C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent, leading to 3 ring signals plus 2 signals for the ethyl group, for a total of 5 signals.\n    *   However, this simplified analysis is incorrect for two reasons:\n        a.  The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) is itself not symmetric. The environment on the side of the C=O is different from the side of the -OCH2CH3. This asymmetry means there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C4 axis, and thus C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        b.  Even if the substituents were symmetric, because the two chair conformers are diastereomers and are unequally populated, the time-averaging process does not restore symmetry perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the five methylene (CH₂) groups in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n4.  **Diastereotopic Protons:**\n    *   For any given methylene group (e.g., at C2) in the ring, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given instant) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule, even when considering its conformational flexibility, lacks the necessary symmetry elements to make them equivalent.\n    *   When the rapid, unequal chair-flipping occurs, the averaged environment of the \"axial-type\" proton is different from the averaged environment of the \"equatorial-type\" proton. They do not become equivalent.\n    *   Thus, for each of the 5 distinct methylene carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), its two protons are also chemically distinct.\n5.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl group:** The -OCH₂CH₃ group has two distinct sets of protons: the methylene protons (-CH₂-) and the methyl protons (-CH₃). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:** There are 5 methylene groups (C2 to C6). Since each carbon's environment is unique, and the two protons on each carbon are also unique (diastereotopic), we have 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring.\n    *   **Total Signals:** 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring protons) = 12 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, Ac2O**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate equivalent of acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol, H2SO4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + NaCN**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOCH2CH3), making its protons acidic.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate): Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n        *   This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in a first alkylation step: (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br.\n        *   The key is \"excess sodium hydride\". The proton on the newly substituted α-carbon is still acidic. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n        *   This intermediate now contains both a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic carbon with a bromine leaving group. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain.\n        *   This intramolecular cyclization is kinetically favored and forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n    C1 -- COO-CH2-CH3\n   /  \\\nH2C--CH2 (C2, C6)\n |   |\nH2C--CH2 (C3, C5)\n \\ /\n  CH2 (C4)\n```\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, ignoring any accidental equivalence. We need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, the C2 part of the ring, and the C6 part of the ring. Because the two ring connections lead through different pathways back to C1, C1 is a chiral center. A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric (lacks a plane of symmetry), the carbons on opposite sides of the ring are not equivalent. Thus, C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   On each of these methylene (CH2) carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. They reside in different chemical environments and are therefore chemically distinct, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Counting the distinct protons on the ring:\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n    *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-):** In many contexts, especially introductory problems, the two protons of an ethyl group's CH2 are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). While they are technically diastereotopic due to the chiral center at C1, it is a common simplification to count them as one signal. Counting them as equivalent is necessary to match one of the provided options. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl CH2) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option B. If we were to be absolutely strict and count the diastereotopic methylene protons of the ethyl group as distinct, the total would be 13, which is not an option. Therefore, the intended answer assumes the common simplification for the ethyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   This set of reagents facilitates the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   The protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are doubly activated.\n*   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this carbon to form an enolate carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n*   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n*   This intermediate still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed to form a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes a second, intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization reaction is favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at one carbon (C1) with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt).\n*   **Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The substituents on C1 will occupy axial and equatorial positions. The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN) (A-value for COOEt ≈ 1.2 kcal/mol, A-value for CN ≈ 0.2 kcal/mol). Therefore, the most stable conformation will have the larger -COOEt group in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group in the axial position.\n*   **Symmetry:** In this stable, \"locked\" conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. It belongs to the C1 point group, meaning it is chiral.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, considering that protons in a chiral molecule are non-equivalent unless related by local C3 rotation (like a methyl group).\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are adjacent to a stereogenic center (via the ester linkage). More accurately, they are in a chiral molecule. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two distinct signals. However, in many introductory NMR problems, diastereotopic protons in a flexible chain like this are often simplified and counted as a single signal group. If we follow this common simplification, the CH2 group gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is chiral (C1 symmetry) and exists in a locked conformation, none of the carbons or protons on one side of the ring are equivalent to those on the other.\n        *   Carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 CH2 groups, each with 2 distinct protons, giving a total of 5 × 2 = **10 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Summing the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH2-, simplified) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) = 12 signals.\n\n*   **Note on the signal count:** A rigorous analysis based on the problem's explicit instruction to count all \"chemically distinct hydrogens\" would yield 13 signals (10 for the ring + 2 for the diastereotopic ethyl CH2 + 1 for the ethyl CH3). Since 13 is not an option, we must assume the common simplification of treating the ethyl CH2 protons as a single group is intended. This path leads directly to option A. The other possibilities (e.g., product being a dimer) are less likely based on the reaction type.\n\nThus, based on the most plausible chemical product and a standard interpretation of NMR signal counting in a test question context, there are 12 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nFinal answer will be presented in the required format.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   Starting Material: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Bromine (Br₂), pyridine (a base), and acetic anhydride.\n    *   This combination of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + Br₂ → BrCH₂COOH + HBr.\n    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   Starting Material: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, an acid catalyst).\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ester.\n    *   The reaction is: BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   Starting Material: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and bromide (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon is activated for S_N2 as it is alpha to a carbonyl group.\n    *   The reaction is: BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Starting Material: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagents: Sodium hydride (NaH, a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   The methylene protons (-CH₂-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester). This reaction is a tandem alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Deprotonation:** NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n           NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        b. **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        c. **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n           NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        d. **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring.\n           The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n      C  - C(=O)O-CH₂-CH₃\n     / \\\n  H₂C   CH₂\n  |     |\n  H₂C   CH₂\n   \\   /\n    CH₂\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents (like -CN and -COOEt) is an **achiral** molecule. At room temperature, due to rapid chair-chair interconversion, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and the protons on them) equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C1 and C4 are unique as they lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, we count the chemically distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, the two protons on the methylene (-CH₂-) group are chemically equivalent. They will appear as one signal (a quartet).\n    *   The three protons on the methyl (-CH₃) group are also equivalent and will appear as one signal (a triplet).\n    *   **Total signals from the ethyl group: 2**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The carbons C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the axial (Hₐₓ) and equatorial (Hₑq) protons are **diastereotopic**. This means H2ₐₓ is not equivalent to H2ₑq. The plane of symmetry makes the proton H2ₐₓ equivalent to H6ₐₓ, and H2ₑq equivalent to H6ₑq. This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on these carbons.\n    *   **Total signals from C2/C6: 2**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry renders H3ₐₓ equivalent to H5ₐₓ, and H3ₑq equivalent to H5ₑq. This gives two more distinct signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C3/C5: 2**\n    *   **C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (H4ₐₓ and H4ₑq) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Thus, they give two different signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C4: 2**\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Final Product's Structure**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes α-bromination (a Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky-type reaction) to yield **Product 1**, bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n*   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) to yield **Product 2**, ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate undergoes nucleophilic substitution (SN2) with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to yield **Product 3**, ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 4:** This is the most complex step. Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-protons. The strong base (NaH) deprotonates the α-carbon. This anion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. Since excess NaH is used, the newly alkylated product is deprotonated again, and the resulting anion performs an intramolecular cyclization (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction). This is a standard and efficient method for forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product (4):** The product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly determining the number of distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Chirality:**\n    The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on the same carbon (C1).\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n    C(1)-------COOCH2CH3\n   /   \\\n  C(2)---C(6)\n /         \\\nC(3)-------C(5)\n \\         /\n   ---C(4)---\n    ```\n    The carbon C1 is attached to four distinct groups: 1) -CN, 2) -COOCH₂CH₃, 3) the -C2-C3-C4- path of the ring, and 4) the -C6-C5-C4- path of the ring. Therefore, **C1 is a chiral center**, and the molecule is fundamentally chiral.\n\n*   **Effect of Conformational Flipping:**\n    At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. However, because the two chair conformers (e.g., -COOEt axial vs. -COOEt equatorial) are diastereomers, they are not of equal energy and will not be equally populated. The time-averaged spectrum is a weighted average of two different conformers. **This averaging process does not introduce a plane of symmetry**. The molecule remains effectively chiral.\n\n*   **Counting the \"Chemically Distinct\" Hydrogens:**\n    The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens. In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not made equivalent by rapid local rotation (like in a methyl group) are chemically distinct.\n\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** Since the molecule is chiral, the two halves of the ring are not equivalent.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n        This gives five distinct methylene (-CH₂-) groups. On each of these CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (the \"axial-like\" and \"equatorial-like\" protons in the time-averaged structure) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 distinct CH₂ groups × 2 distinct protons per group = **10 signals from the ring protons**.\n\n    2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are in a chiral molecule. They are four bonds away from the chiral center (C1), making them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. A strictly literal interpretation would count them as **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Reconciling with the Options:**\n    *   A completely strict count gives 10 (ring) + 1 (CH₃) + 2 (-OCH₂-) = **13 signals**. This is not among the options.\n    *   This implies a simplification is expected. The parenthetical remark in the question `(some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable...)` provides a strong clue. Diastereotopic protons in a flexible side chain (like the -OCH₂- group) are often very close in chemical shift and can be difficult to resolve, so they are often simplified in textbook problems as giving a single signal.\n    *   Applying this simplification: Treat the two -OCH₂- protons as one signal group.\n    *   **Final Count with Simplification:** 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH₃) + 1 (from the ethyl -OCH₂-) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis total of 12 matches option C. The reasoning is sound, relies on the most likely chemical product, and uses a standard and justified simplification to match the provided choices. The alternative lines of reasoning (leading to 8 or 10 signals) either rely on an incorrect assumption about the molecule's symmetry or assume a less likely chemical product.\n\n<<<C>>>"

While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, the combination of acetic anhydride, pyridine, and Br2 achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride likely forms a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which enolizes more readily. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. These α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. Since the chain has 5 carbons, a stable 6-membered ring is formed. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt), C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It belongs to the C1 point group.\n\n2.  **Chemically Distinct Protons:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons are chemically non-equivalent unless they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying a theoretical count.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** These two methylene protons are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1). The chiral center is four bonds away (-CH₂-O-C(=O)-C₁). In a strict theoretical sense, they are in different chemical environments and should give **2 distinct signals**. However, in introductory and intermediate level problems, it is a common simplification to consider diastereotopic protons on a flexible side chain distant from the chiral center as being practically equivalent (isochronous) and giving a single signal. Let's evaluate both possibilities.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (CH₂) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the environment of C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. All five CH₂ groups are non-equivalent.\n    *   Within each CH₂ group in the chiral ring, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups will contribute 2 distinct proton signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\n\n*   **Strict Theoretical Count:** 1 (from CH₃) + 2 (from diastereotopic -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **13 signals**.\n*   This number is not among the options (A) 5, B) 10, C) 8, D) 12).\n\n*   **Count with Common Simplification:** The options provided suggest that a simplification is expected. The most reasonable one is to treat the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's -OCH₂- as having the same chemical shift, as their non-equivalence is often small due to distance and flexibility.\n    *   If we count the -OCH₂- protons as one signal:\n    *   Total signals = 1 (from CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D. The parenthetical note in the question is slightly ambiguous, but the available choices strongly point toward this interpretation, where the clear and significant non-equivalence of the 10 ring protons is counted, but the minor non-equivalence of the side-chain methylene protons is ignored.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an alpha-halogenation reaction of a carboxylic acid, functionally similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by a double alkylation (the second being intramolecular).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a stable carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule:\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion at one end of the chain attacks the carbon bearing the bromine at the other end, closing a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Conformation and Symmetry:**\n    1.  Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The ethoxycarbonyl group is bulkier than the cyano group. To minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions), the ring will predominantly exist in the chair conformation where the bulky -COOCH2CH3 group is in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group is in the axial position.\n    2.  This conformational preference is strong, so the ring can be considered \"locked\" and not undergoing rapid chair-flipping at room temperature.\n    3.  In this locked conformation, the molecule is **chiral**. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens.\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** Because the molecule is chiral and asymmetric, all ten protons on the five CH₂ groups of the cyclohexane ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments. The axial and equatorial protons at each position are different (diastereotopic), and no two positions are equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 is not equivalent to C6). Therefore, there are **10 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation about the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the complex chiral environment of the ring. This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct. However, in many introductory NMR problems, such diastereotopic protons in a flexible side chain are often simplified and treated as equivalent, producing a single signal (a quartet). If we apply this common simplification, the methylene group gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the rigorous analysis of the locked, chiral ring structure (10 signals) and applying the common simplification for the ethyl group (2 signals: one for -CH₂- and one for -CH₃-), the total number of observable signals is:\n    *   10 (ring) + 1 (-CH₂) + 1 (-CH₃) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches one of the given options. The alternative, assuming rapid ring flipping, would lead to 5 signals, which is less likely given the steric bulk on C1 and the phrasing of the question emphasizing chemical distinctness. The fully rigorous count (13 signals, by not simplifying the ethyl group) is not an option. Thus, 12 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups. This forms an enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  Since excess NaH is used, this intermediate is also deprotonated at the α-carbon, forming a new enolate: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]-.\n    4.  This enolate then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals are very close.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Symmetry:**\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. On the NMR timescale, this results in a time-averaged structure.\n*   Because the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule is strictly chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n*   However, for the purpose of analyzing NMR spectra in introductory problems, we often assume free rotation of the ester group, which creates an \"effective\" or \"time-averaged\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Let's proceed with this standard simplification, as analyzing the molecule as strictly chiral leads to 13 signals, which is not an option.\n*   This effective plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to the effective symmetry plane), the local environment is asymmetric due to proximity to the complex ring structure (C1 is a prochiral center). Replacement of one proton versus the other with a test group would create diastereomers. Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry passes through the C4 atom and bisects the H-C-H angle. Protons related by a plane of symmetry are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal** for the two C4 protons.\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (the \"axial-like\" and \"equatorial-like\" protons) are not related by any symmetry element and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one is cis to the cyano group, the other is trans, averaged over conformations). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The protons on C6 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 case, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for CH2) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H2) + 2 (for C2/C6-H2) + 2 (for C3/C5-H2) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the specific reagents are a variation, the fundamental reaction is similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions, similar to a malonic ester synthesis, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic. The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n    C(1)-------COOCH2CH3\n   /   \\\n  C(2)---C(6)\n /         \\\nC(3)-------C(5)\n \\         /\n   ---C(4)---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes certain pairs of atoms and protons equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Topicity and Chemical Equivalence:** We need to identify sets of protons that are chemically equivalent. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation or by rapid conformational changes. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct (non-equivalent).\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are non-equivalent and give distinct NMR signals.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. They are adjacent to a prochiral quaternary carbon (C1) and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring (-C6H10-):** We assume rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature.\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions (4H):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" and the other \"trans\" relative to the substituents on C1). Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C6, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions (4H):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5 due to symmetry. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position (2H):** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are interchanged by reflection through this plane. This makes them enantiotopic. In an achiral solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nEach of these 8 sets of protons is chemically distinct, leading to 8 observable signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 4.**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   The alpha-carbon is the methyl carbon. Bromination occurs at this position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n    *   Reactants: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH) and ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   The carboxyl group is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Ethyl cyanoacetate has two acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups (the alpha-carbon).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    *   The problem presents two main possibilities for the subsequent alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br):\n        *   **Path A (Intramolecular):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. The resulting intermediate is then deprotonated again by the excess NaH, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the pentyl chain. This forms a 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction). The product would be **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n        *   **Path B (Intermolecular):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This would be favored under high concentrations of the enolate. The product would be a dimer: **(EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)**.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR signals for both potential products to see which one matches the given options.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential product.**\n\n*   **Analysis for Path A Product (ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, -C₂H₄- ring segment, and -C₂H₄- other ring segment). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. There are no planes or centers of symmetry.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃ group are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH₂- group are adjacent to a stereocenter (via the ester linkage). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all five CH₂ groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (axial and equatorial in the chair conformations) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH₂ groups gives rise to 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH₂ groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path A product = 1 (CH₃) + 2 (CH₂) + 10 (ring) = 13 signals.** This number is not among the options (A=8, B=10, C=5, D=12). This suggests that either this product is incorrect, or a simplifying assumption is being made.\n\n*   **Analysis for Path B Product ((EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)):**\n    *   This reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). For NMR analysis, we often consider the most symmetric species, the meso compound, which can simplify the spectrum.\n    *   **Symmetry of the meso-(R,S) isomer:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group of the five-carbon chain. This symmetry makes corresponding groups on either side of the axis equivalent.\n    *   Let's label the chain: (end-group-A)-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2')-CH₂(1')-(end-group-A).\n    *   **End groups (-CH(CN)COOEt):** The two end groups are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The two α-protons (-CH) are equivalent: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH₂ protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center. The two CH₃ groups are equivalent. So, we get **2 signals** from the CH₂ groups and **1 signal** from the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Pentane chain protons (- (CH₂)₅ -):**\n        *   The central CH₂(3) group is unique. Its two geminal protons are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(2) and CH₂(2') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH₂(1) and CH₂(1') groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons on one group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals for Path B meso product = [1(α-H) + 2(Et-CH₂) + 1(Et-CH₃)] + [2(C3) + 2(C2/2') + 2(C1/1')] = 4 + 6 = 10 signals.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe intramolecular cyclization (Path A) leads to a product with 13 theoretical ¹H NMR signals, which is not an option. The intermolecular dimerization (Path B), when analyzing the symmetric meso-diastereomer, leads to a product with 10 distinct ¹H NMR signals. Since 10 is one of the given options, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis and the structure of the final product to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes bromination at the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** One hydrogen on the alpha-carbon (the methyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Starting material:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (acid catalyst). This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Starting material:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine atom via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group (-CN).\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Starting material:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3). This molecule has an \"active methylene\" group (-CH2-) flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group), making its protons acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom. This is the first alkylation.\n        Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures that the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of this intermediate is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    4.  This new enolate then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with the cyano and ethyl ester groups attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. Due to this and rotation around the single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon in the ring (C4), the cyano group, and the ester functional group. This makes the molecule, on average, achiral.\n    *   This plane of symmetry means that C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral, the steric and electronic environment near the complex C1 substituent is asymmetric enough to make the two protons magnetically non-equivalent. They will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are mirror images of each other. They are enantiotopic and therefore chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" on average) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** Similar to C3/C5, these two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. The four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H) + 2 (for C3/C5-H) + 2 (for C2/C6-H) = 5 signals.\n    *   Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = **8**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is intended to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The acidic protons are on the α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromine will substitute one of these hydrogens.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are highly acidic because they are flanked by two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group, -CN, and the ester group, -COOEt). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH will deprotonate this carbon as well.\n        `NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable because it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl ester group attached to the same carbon (C1). The name of the compound is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n     /\nC(1)--COOCH₂CH₃\n |  \\\nC(6)-C(2)\n|    |\nC(5)-C(3)\n \\  /\n  C(4)\n```\n\nWe look for chemical equivalence based on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in time-averaged environments. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C6. However, on any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons are not equivalent. They are *diastereotopic* because C1 is a prochiral center. Therefore, they will have different chemical shifts. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 itself are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons are also diastereotopic. One is on one side of the ring relative to the substituents on C1, and the other is on the other side. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n    *   Total from the ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = 8 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Elucidating the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1:**\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic anhydride likely serves to form an acyl bromide intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base.\n    *   Reactant: CH3-COOH\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heat → Product 2:**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH3CH2OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n    *   Product 3: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH, then 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:**\n    *   This is a multi-step process within one reaction vessel.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from ethyl cyanoacetate. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) group and the ester (-COOEt) group.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **b. First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation, which still has one acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n        *   (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **d. Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring (the alpha-carbon + the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The chemical name is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n           CN\n          /\n     (C1)----COOCH2CH3\n    /   \\\n H2C(C2)--CH2(C6)\n/           \\\nH2C(C3)         CH2(C5)\n\\           /\n ----CH2(C4)----\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, due to rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule possesses an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester's C=O and ether oxygen.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        1.  **-CH₃ protons:** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n        2.  **-OCH₂- protons:** The C1 carbon is a prochiral center (it is attached to four different groups if we consider the ring pathways). Therefore, the two methylene hydrogens of the ethyl group are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:**\n        3.  **C2 and C6 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, on C2 itself, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation). Thus, there is one set of two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C6) and another set of two equivalent protons (the other one on C2, the other on C6). **(2 signals)**\n        4.  **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives two distinct signals from these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        5.  **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The plane bisects the H-C4-H angle, making the two protons on C4 mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are homotopic and chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = 8**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the typical Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions use PBr3, these reagents also accomplish the bromination at the α-carbon. Acetic anhydride may form a mixed anhydride or an enol acetate intermediate, which is then brominated. Pyridine acts as a base and/or catalyst.\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion (Br-).\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This step involves the alkylation of an active methylene compound. The α-hydrogens of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon: NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile, 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two main possibilities for the final product, depending on the reaction pathway which is influenced by stoichiometry and reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Intramolecular Cyclization:**\n    1.  Mono-alkylation: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    2.  With excess NaH, this intermediate is deprotonated again: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    3.  This anion undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a stable 6-membered ring. This is a very common and efficient way to synthesize carbocycles.\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure A):** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Intermolecular Dimerization:**\n    1.  Two equivalents of the enolate react with one equivalent of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    2.  2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt).\n    *   **Product 4 (Structure B):** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate.\n\n*   **Which product is formed?** Pathway A (cyclization) is generally the major product for forming 5- and 6-membered rings. However, the exact outcome can depend on conditions. Let's analyze the NMR signals for both possibilities.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis**\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (Cyclohexane derivative):**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation because the two substituents on C1 are different. The molecule belongs to the C1 point group.\n*   **Signal Counting:** In a molecule with no symmetry (C1 point group), all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent due to free rotation. → **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -O-CH2- group are adjacent to an asymmetric quaternary carbon (C1). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. → **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring (-CH2-)5:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no symmetry.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. → **10 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure A:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 10 (ring) = **13 signals**. This is not among the options. Let's consider plausible simplifications. If the two diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group's CH2 were accidentally equivalent (isochronous), the total would be 12 signals (Option B).\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (Dimer):**\n*   **Structure:** (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt). Let's denote the chain as X-(CH2a)-(CH2b)-(CH2c)-(CH2b')-(CH2a')-X, where X is the CH(CN)COOEt group. This molecule can exist as a racemic pair (d,l diastereomers) and a meso compound. Both forms give the same number of signals in an achiral NMR solvent.\n*   **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the racemic (d,l) form, which has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the central carbon (Cc) of the pentyl chain. This axis makes the two halves of the molecule equivalent.\n*   **Signal Counting:**\n    *   **The two X groups (CH(CN)COOEt) are equivalent.**\n        *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n            *   The six methyl (-CH3) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n            *   The four methylene (-O-CH2-) protons belong to two equivalent groups. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (adjacent to a chiral center). → **2 signals**.\n        *   The two methine (-CH(CN)) protons are equivalent. → **1 signal**.\n    *   **The pentamethylene bridge -(CH2)5-:**\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'a' and 'a'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'a' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The CH2 groups at positions 'b' and 'b'' are equivalent. The two protons on group 'b' are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n        *   The central CH2 group 'c' is unique. Its two protons are diastereotopic. → **2 signals**.\n*   **Total for Structure B:** 1 (Et-Me) + 2 (Et-CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2a) + 2 (CH2b) + 2 (CH2c) = **10 signals**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the dimer (Structure B) leads to exactly 10 distinct hydrogen signals, which matches option A. While the cyclohexane (Structure A) is arguably the more probable chemical product, a rigorous count of its signals (13) does not match any option. To make it match, one would need to assume accidental equivalence of signals (e.g., getting 12 signals, Option B). Since the dimer product is also a chemically plausible outcome and its theoretical NMR signal count perfectly matches one of the answers without any further assumptions, it is the most likely intended answer for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step reaction analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction selectively brominates the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the hydrogens on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification.

The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon bearing the bromine is a primary carbon, ideal for SN2.\n    *   **Product 3:** The cyanide group replaces the bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an intramolecular dialkylation of an active methylene compound.\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate): `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation. Intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`.\n        *   The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: `[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻`.\n        *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\n\nThe molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group. At room temperature, due to fast chair-chair interconversion and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (on average).\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The right side and left side of the ring are equivalent.\n*   Carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C6.\n*   Carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe will count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal** (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are isochronous (have the same chemical shift). They will produce **1 signal** (a quartet).\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    In a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on a given CH2 group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.

The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon bonded to bromine and displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Reaction analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester carbonyl). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the remaining acidic α-proton on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The carbanion within this intermediate now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This reaction forms a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product. Chemical non-equivalence is determined by the absence of symmetry operations (like planes or axes of symmetry) that can interchange protons.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is attached to two different substituents: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the different types of protons:\n\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This breaks any potential plane of symmetry that would pass through the C1-C4 axis of the ring.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry, the carbons on one side of the ring are not equivalent to the carbons on the other side.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n    *   This gives us 5 distinct methylene (-CH₂-) groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Now, we must consider the protons on each methylene group. In a cyclohexane ring, the two geminal protons on a single carbon atom (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule) and thus are chemically distinct.\n    *   The most rigorous count gives 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 distinct methylene groups. This would lead to 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   However, at room temperature, many substituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons. If we assume this fast-flipping model, each of the 5 distinct methylene groups gives rise to one time-averaged signal.\n    *   Under the fast-flipping assumption, the ring protons contribute **5 signals**.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The C1 carbon of the ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH₂CH₃, and the two different paths around the ring (-C2-C3... and -C6-C5...). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group of the ethyl ester is adjacent to this chiral center. Protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two separate signals.\n    *   The methyl (-CH₃) group has three equivalent protons due to free rotation, which give one signal.\n    *   Therefore, a strict analysis of the ethyl group yields 2 signals from the -OCH₂- protons and 1 signal from the -CH₃ protons, for a total of **3 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nCombining the two simplifying assumptions that are most common for such problems at room temperature:\n*   Fast ring-flipping model for the cyclohexane ring: **5 signals**.\n*   Strict diastereotopicity model for the ethyl group attached to a chiral center: **3 signals**.\n\nTotal signals = 5 (from ring) + 3 (from ethyl) = **8**.\n\nLet's quickly check other possibilities. If we assumed a locked ring (10 signals) and a simplified ethyl group (2 signals, ignoring diastereotopicity), we would get 12 signals. However, it's inconsistent to assume the ring is chiral (giving 10 distinct signals) while ignoring the consequence of that chirality on the adjacent ethyl group. The analysis leading to 8 signals is more self-consistent under common simplifying physical assumptions (fast flipping). The fact that an alternative, more complex symmetry argument also leads to 8 reinforces this conclusion.\n\nThus, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to promote enolization and neutralize the HBr byproduct. The bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process: deprotonation followed by alkylation, then a second deprotonation followed by intramolecular alkylation (cyclization).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic protons from the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is still base present to remove the second, remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion is in the same molecule as a good leaving group (Br). Intramolecular SN2 reactions to form stable 5- or 6-membered rings are very fast. Here, the alpha-carbon attacks the terminal carbon of the 5-carbon chain, closing a 6-membered ring. This is a type of Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nNow we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n2.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   Substituted cyclohexanes exist predominantly in chair conformations. Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the two possible chair conformations are diastereomers (not enantiomers).\n        *   **Conformer A:** Cyano group axial, ethoxycarbonyl group equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B:** Cyano group equatorial, ethoxycarbonyl group axial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is sterically bulkier than the cyano group. Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and the two conformers are not equally populated at equilibrium.\n    *   At room temperature, the interconversion (chair flip) between these two diastereomeric conformers is very rapid on the 1H NMR timescale. The observed spectrum is a weighted average of the spectra of the two individual conformers.\n3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:**\n    *   A simplified analysis might assume a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4 of the ring. This would make C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent, leading to 3 ring signals plus 2 signals for the ethyl group, for a total of 5 signals.\n    *   However, this simplified analysis is incorrect for two reasons:\n        a.  The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) is itself not symmetric. The environment on the side of the C=O is different from the side of the -OCH2CH3. This asymmetry means there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C4 axis, and thus C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        b.  Even if the substituents were symmetric, because the two chair conformers are diastereomers and are unequally populated, the time-averaging process does not restore symmetry perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the five methylene (CH₂) groups in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n4.  **Diastereotopic Protons:**\n    *   For any given methylene group (e.g., at C2) in the ring, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given instant) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule, even when considering its conformational flexibility, lacks the necessary symmetry elements to make them equivalent.\n    *   When the rapid, unequal chair-flipping occurs, the averaged environment of the \"axial-type\" proton is different from the averaged environment of the \"equatorial-type\" proton. They do not become equivalent.\n    *   Thus, for each of the 5 distinct methylene carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), its two protons are also chemically distinct.\n5.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl group:** The -OCH₂CH₃ group has two distinct sets of protons: the methylene protons (-CH₂-) and the methyl protons (-CH₃). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:** There are 5 methylene groups (C2 to C6). Since each carbon's environment is unique, and the two protons on each carbon are also unique (diastereotopic), we have 5 carbons × 2 distinct protons/carbon = **10 signals** from the ring.\n    *   **Total Signals:** 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring protons) = 12 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, Ac2O**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate equivalent of acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol, H2SO4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + NaCN**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:**\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOCH2CH3), making its protons acidic.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate): Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n        *   This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in a first alkylation step: (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br.\n        *   The key is \"excess sodium hydride\". The proton on the newly substituted α-carbon is still acidic. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n        *   This intermediate now contains both a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic carbon with a bromine leaving group. An intramolecular SN2 reaction occurs. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain.\n        *   This intramolecular cyclization is kinetically favored and forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n    C1 -- COO-CH2-CH3\n   /  \\\nH2C--CH2 (C2, C6)\n |   |\nH2C--CH2 (C3, C5)\n \\ /\n  CH2 (C4)\n```\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, ignoring any accidental equivalence. We need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, the C2 part of the ring, and the C6 part of the ring. Because the two ring connections lead through different pathways back to C1, C1 is a chiral center. A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric (lacks a plane of symmetry), the carbons on opposite sides of the ring are not equivalent. Thus, C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   On each of these methylene (CH2) carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic. They reside in different chemical environments and are therefore chemically distinct, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Counting the distinct protons on the ring:\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (H_ax, H_eq)\n    *   This gives a total of 5 x 2 = **10 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-):** In many contexts, especially introductory problems, the two protons of an ethyl group's CH2 are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). While they are technically diastereotopic due to the chiral center at C1, it is a common simplification to count them as one signal. Counting them as equivalent is necessary to match one of the provided options. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl CH2) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option B. If we were to be absolutely strict and count the diastereotopic methylene protons of the ethyl group as distinct, the total would be 13, which is not an option. Therefore, the intended answer assumes the common simplification for the ethyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   This set of reagents facilitates the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction.

This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n*   This intermediate still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed to form a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes a second, intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization reaction is favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at one carbon (C1) with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt).\n*   **Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. The substituents on C1 will occupy axial and equatorial positions. The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN) (A-value for COOEt ≈ 1.2 kcal/mol, A-value for CN ≈ 0.2 kcal/mol). Therefore, the most stable conformation will have the larger -COOEt group in the equatorial position and the smaller -CN group in the axial position.\n*   **Symmetry:** In this stable, \"locked\" conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. It belongs to the C1 point group, meaning it is chiral.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, considering that protons in a chiral molecule are non-equivalent unless related by local C3 rotation (like a methyl group).\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are adjacent to a stereogenic center (via the ester linkage). More accurately, they are in a chiral molecule. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two distinct signals. However, in many introductory NMR problems, diastereotopic protons in a flexible chain like this are often simplified and counted as a single signal group. If we follow this common simplification, the CH2 group gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is chiral (C1 symmetry) and exists in a locked conformation, none of the carbons or protons on one side of the ring are equivalent to those on the other.\n        *   Carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct.\n        *   On each of these five CH2 groups, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 CH2 groups, each with 2 distinct protons, giving a total of 5 × 2 = **10 signals** from the ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Summing the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH2-, simplified) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) = 12 signals.\n\n*   **Note on the signal count:** A rigorous analysis based on the problem's explicit instruction to count all \"chemically distinct hydrogens\" would yield 13 signals (10 for the ring + 2 for the diastereotopic ethyl CH2 + 1 for the ethyl CH3). Since 13 is not an option, we must assume the common simplification of treating the ethyl CH2 protons as a single group is intended. This path leads directly to option A. The other possibilities (e.g., product being a dimer) are less likely based on the reaction type.\n\nThus, based on the most plausible chemical product and a standard interpretation of NMR signal counting in a test question context, there are 12 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nFinal answer will be presented in the required format.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   Starting Material: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Bromine (Br₂), pyridine (a base), and acetic anhydride.\n    *   This combination of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.

This reaction is a tandem alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Deprotonation:** NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n           NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        b. **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        c. **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n           NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        d. **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring.\n           The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n      C  - C(=O)O-CH₂-CH₃\n     / \\\n  H₂C   CH₂\n  |     |\n  H₂C   CH₂\n   \\   /\n    CH₂\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents (like -CN and -COOEt) is an **achiral** molecule. At room temperature, due to rapid chair-chair interconversion, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and the protons on them) equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C1 and C4 are unique as they lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, we count the chemically distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, the two protons on the methylene (-CH₂-) group are chemically equivalent. They will appear as one signal (a quartet).\n    *   The three protons on the methyl (-CH₃) group are also equivalent and will appear as one signal (a triplet).\n    *   **Total signals from the ethyl group: 2**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The carbons C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the axial (Hₐₓ) and equatorial (Hₑq) protons are **diastereotopic**. This means H2ₐₓ is not equivalent to H2ₑq. The plane of symmetry makes the proton H2ₐₓ equivalent to H6ₐₓ, and H2ₑq equivalent to H6ₑq. This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on these carbons.\n    *   **Total signals from C2/C6: 2**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry renders H3ₐₓ equivalent to H5ₐₓ, and H3ₑq equivalent to H5ₑq. This gives two more distinct signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C3/C5: 2**\n    *   **C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (H4ₐₓ and H4ₑq) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Thus, they give two different signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C4: 2**\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
