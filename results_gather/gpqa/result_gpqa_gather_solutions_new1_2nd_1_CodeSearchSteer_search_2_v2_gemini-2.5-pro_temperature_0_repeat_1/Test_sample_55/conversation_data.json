Each hypothesis consists of a specific decay path and an associated probability.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: Physical Validity of the Path**: The first filter applied was the set of electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1). The script verified that the paths proposed in options A, B, and C are all physically possible, as each step in the two-transition cascade adheres to these rules. Option D was noted as malformed.\n    *   **Step 1**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩. This is allowed since Δl = +1 and Δm can be 0, ±1.\n    *   **Step 2**: |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. This is allowed since Δl = -1 and Δm can be 0, ±1.\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Transition Probability**: The second filter was the theoretical probability of a specific decay route. The script calculated that the initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, the decay to the three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) must occur with equal probability. Since there are three such paths, the probability for any single, specific path is exactly 1/3.\n\n4.  **Final Selection**: The script compared the probability of each valid hypothesis with the calculated theoretical probability of 1/3.\n    *   Hypothesis A: Path |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the theoretical value and **survives**.\n    *   Hypothesis B: Path |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This does not match and is pruned.\n    *   Hypothesis C: Path |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This does not match and is pruned.\n    *   Hypothesis D: Malformed and has an incorrect probability of 2/3. It is pruned.\n\nThe only candidate that survived both filtering steps was A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This process is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determine the Possible Decay Paths\nLet's trace the path from the initial state to the final state through a valid intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. For a two-step cascade to $n=1$, the intermediate state will have $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final State:** $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is from $l'=1$ to $l=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is from $m'$ to $m=0$. For all possible intermediate values ($m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$), the change $\\Delta m = -m'$ is in the set $\\{1, 0, -1\\}$. This is also allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to this symmetry, in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   This means the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state is **equal**.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability for any single specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The second transition, from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, has only one possible decay channel to a lower energy level (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three valid routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\nNow we evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The path is valid (though malformed), but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the only one that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe question asks for the correct decay route and corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two consecutive dipole transitions.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Understand the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor a radiative decay to occur via an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers of the initial and final states must obey specific selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0, ±1.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, n, must decrease.\n\n### 2. Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the initial state |3,0,0⟩ and decays to an intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩.\n*   **Initial State:** |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1 (as Δl = l' - 0 = ±1, and l' must be non-negative).\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1 (as Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1).\n*   **Applying the Δn rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease (n' < 3). Since the final state is n=1, a two-step process implies an intermediate n=2.\n*   **Possible Intermediate States:** Combining these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Second Transition\nThe atom then decays from one of the intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Final State:** |n,l,m⟩ = |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** The change is Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the rule.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** The change is Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This is allowed for all possible intermediate m' values (-1, 0, 1), as the resulting Δm would be +1, 0, or -1, respectively.\n*   **Conclusion on Paths:** All three potential decay paths through the n=2, l=1 manifold are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay to each of the three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) is equally likely. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability for any single one is 1/3.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only allowed electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the |1,0,0⟩ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    P(total) = P(step 1) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nWe are looking for an option that lists a valid path with a probability of 1/3.\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The path is valid (assuming a typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules that dictate the allowed changes in the quantum numbers $l$ (orbital angular momentum) and $m$ (magnetic quantum number).\n*   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$. The parity of the wavefunction must change.\n*   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow$ Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $n' < n$:** The principal quantum number must decrease from $n=3$. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State $\\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\nLet's verify that a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For all possible values of $m'$, the change in $m$ is allowed ($0 - (-1) = +1$; $0 - 0 = 0$; $0 - 1 = -1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three paths, via each of the possible intermediate states, are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p level) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level) via a single-photon E1 transition. There are no other lower-energy states it can decay to. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the crucial part. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, and in the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\nThe total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n*   $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid path with the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: This option is malformed, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition (Initial to Intermediate):**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n    *   Let the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_i < n$:** The intermediate state must have $n_i < 3$. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i > 1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n_i=2$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition (Intermediate to Final):**\n    *   **Intermediate States:** $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ where $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_i = 0 - m_i$. For all possible values of $m_i$ ($-1, 0, 1$), the resulting $\\Delta m$ ($+1, 0, -1$) is allowed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways, via each of the intermediate states, are physically allowed according to the selection rules.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probability:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n    *   **First Step Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. This symmetry implies that the decay to each of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m_i = -1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state is equally probable. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a single-photon E1 transition (as it's the only available lower energy level). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We have determined that any of the three paths (via intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$) is valid, and each has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we check the options provided in the question:\n\n    *   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid path and the correct probability.\n    *   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: Assuming the typo is corrected to show the initial state, the path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the only one that is fully correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Physical Process and Constraints\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $l$ (orbital angular momentum) and $m$ (magnetic quantum number):\n*   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$. The orbital angular momentum must change by exactly one unit.\n*   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$. The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one unit.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determine the Possible Decay Paths\n\nLet's trace the path from the initial state to the final state.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)**\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)**\n*   Let's verify if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For any of our possible intermediate states ($m' = -1, 0, 1$), the resulting $\\Delta m$ will be $+1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$, all of which are allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Due to this symmetry, when the atom decays, the probability of it transitioning to any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state is exactly the same.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n*   Therefore, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these three paths is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of the second step (from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy level. Thus, the overall probability of the cascade is determined entirely by the first step.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's compare our findings with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The path is valid (assuming the missing initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$), but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Transition\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules that dictate how the quantum numbers can change:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The change in the orbital quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Analyze the Two-Step Decay Path\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The full decay path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. Since the final state is $n=1$, the most likely intermediate state (and the one suggested by the options) is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible values of $m'$ (i.e., $\\Delta m$ can be $0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways, via the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are physically allowed according to the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p level) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level) via a single-photon dipole transition. There are no other lower energy levels it can decay to. Therefore, once the atom reaches the 2p level, it is guaranteed to decay to the 1s level. The probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the crucial part. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions), and there is no preference for which of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) it will transition to.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    *   $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\nWe have determined that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of 1/3.

Understand the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole transition. This means the atom passes through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and the final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying the selection rules:**\n    *   **l-selection:** The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires that the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n    *   **m-selection:** The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means the intermediate state can have $m_i = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **n-selection:** The principal quantum number must decrease ($n_i < 3$). Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i > 1$. This leaves $n_i=2$.\n*   **Possible Intermediate States:** Combining these rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition\nThe atom decays from one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (where $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Checking the selection rules:**\n    *   **l-selection:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **m-selection:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed for all possible $m_i$ values ($-1, 0, 1$), as the result will be $1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways, via each of the intermediate states, are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$).\n*   In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m_i=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $|2,1\\rangle$ state is equal.\n*   Since there are three equally likely decay channels for the first step, the probability for any single channel is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The second step of the decay, from any $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ state, has only one possible lower-energy state to decay to via a dipole transition: the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe core task is to identify a valid decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Selection Rules and Possible Intermediate States**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the electric dipole (E1) selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\nApplying these rules to the first transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   Since $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires that the intermediate state has $l'=1$.\n    *   Since $m=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the decay is a two-step cascade to $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** There is a strong consensus among all agents that the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate the Second Transition**\nThe second transition is from one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Change in m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways (via $m'=-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$) are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Careful Point: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThis is the critical step where the options differ. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Therefore, the probability of this step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a *specific* intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   A vast majority of the agents correctly identified the key physical principle: the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital and is **spherically symmetric**.\n    *   Due to this symmetry (and in the absence of external fields), there is no preferred direction for the decay. The atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sub-levels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, any valid decay path has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's evaluate the options presented in the original prompt:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   Assuming the typo means the path is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nOnly option B presents a physically correct statement. The confusion among the candidate answers regarding the final letter (A, B, C, or D) stems from inconsistent parsing of the original question's options. However, the physical reasoning consistently points to a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for any of the valid paths. Based on the options provided in the prompt, B is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process and Rules\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs in two steps, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to identify a valid path and its probability.\n\nThe process is governed by the **electric dipole selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Transition Path\nThe decay is a two-step cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must first identify the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state (intermediate):** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $n''=1, l''=0, m''=0$.\n*   **Checking $\\Delta l$:** $\\Delta l = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n*   **Checking $\\Delta m$:** $\\Delta m = m'' - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed as long as $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which it is.\n\n**Conclusion on Paths:** All three potential pathways (via intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) are physically allowed by the selection rules. The paths listed in options A, C, and D are all valid.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Transition Probability\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state) via a single-photon E1 transition. There are no other lower energy levels it can decay to. Therefore, once the atom reaches the intermediate state, it is guaranteed to decay to the final state. The probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The overall probability of the cascade is therefore determined by the probability of the first step, i.e., the branching ratio for the decay $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is **spherically symmetric**.\n    *   In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Consequently, the decay to each of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $l'=1$ state must occur with **equal probability**.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n\nTherefore, the probability for each of the three valid decay routes is:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The path is valid.\n    *   The probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0⟩ to the ground state |1,0,0⟩. This is not a single transition but a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the changes in the quantum numbers must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   For emission, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n*   **Initial State**: |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1**: Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   **Applying n' < n**: The principal quantum number must decrease from n=3. Since the final state is n=1, a logical intermediate step is n'=2.\n\nCombining these points, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩\nLet's verify that a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate States**: |2,1,m'⟩ where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n*   **Final State**: |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1**: The change is l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1**: The change is m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. For all possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1), the resulting Δm (+1, 0, -1) is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This is a crucial point.\n*   Due to this symmetry, in the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   This means the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n*   Since there are three equally likely, mutually exclusive outcomes for the first transition, the probability for any single one of them is exactly **1/3**.\n\nThe probability of the second step (from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩) is 1, because this is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability of the two-step cascade is determined entirely by the probability of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid path with a probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the provided candidate answers and identifying the key points to reach a final, correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n    The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, meaning it must pass through an intermediate state. Each step of this process must obey the electric dipole selection rules, which are consistently identified by all candidate answers:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Possible Decay Paths**\n    The decay proceeds as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition (Initial to Intermediate):**\n        *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule to the initial $l=0$ state requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule to the initial $m=0$ state allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Since the decay is a two-step cascade to $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   This leads to a clear consensus among all candidate answers: the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition (Intermediate to Final):**\n        *   The transition is from an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   The change in $l$ is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   The change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$, which is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m'$.\n        *   Therefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability**\n    This is the most critical step. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of the First Step:** The probability of the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a *specific* intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the determining factor. The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the key physical principle:\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**.\n        *   Due to this symmetry, and in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the decay. The atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three possible magnetic sub-levels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single, specific path is exactly **1/3**.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Central Physics Principle:** The calculation of the probability hinges on the spherical symmetry of the initial $l=0$ state. This symmetry dictates that the branching ratios to the three possible intermediate $m'$ states are equal.\n*   **Distinguishing Paths vs. Total Probability:** The question asks for the probability of a *specific* route (e.g., via the $m'=0$ intermediate state), not the total probability of the atom decaying from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1, \\text{any } m'\\rangle$, which would be 1.\n*   **Inconsistency in Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers show significant confusion regarding the lettering (A, B, C, D) of the options. For example, different agents assign the correct answer, \"|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3\", to options A, B, C, and D. This means the final decision must be based on the physical content of the option, not the letter chosen by the agents.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unanimous physical reasoning derived from the candidate answers, any valid decay path for this process must have a probability of 1/3.

Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This process is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determine the Possible Decay Paths\nLet's trace the path from the initial state to the final state through a valid intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. For a two-step cascade to $n=1$, the intermediate state will have $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final State:** $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is from $l'=1$ to $l=0$, so $\\Delta l = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is from $m'$ to $m=0$. For all possible intermediate values ($m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$), the change $\\Delta m = -m'$ is in the set $\\{1, 0, -1\\}$. This is also allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to this symmetry, in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   This means the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state is **equal**.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability for any single specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The second transition, from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, has only one possible decay channel to a lower energy level (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three valid routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\nNow we evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The path is valid (though malformed), but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the only one that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe question asks for the correct decay route and corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two consecutive dipole transitions.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Understand the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor a radiative decay to occur via an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers of the initial and final states must obey specific selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0, ±1.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, n, must decrease.\n\n### 2. Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the initial state |3,0,0⟩ and decays to an intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩.\n*   **Initial State:** |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1 (as Δl = l' - 0 = ±1, and l' must be non-negative).\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1 (as Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1).\n*   **Applying the Δn rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease (n' < 3). Since the final state is n=1, a two-step process implies an intermediate n=2.\n*   **Possible Intermediate States:** Combining these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Second Transition\nThe atom then decays from one of the intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Final State:** |n,l,m⟩ = |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** The change is Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the rule.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** The change is Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This is allowed for all possible intermediate m' values (-1, 0, 1), as the resulting Δm would be +1, 0, or -1, respectively.\n*   **Conclusion on Paths:** All three potential decay paths through the n=2, l=1 manifold are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay to each of the three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) is equally likely. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability for any single one is 1/3.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only allowed electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the |1,0,0⟩ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    P(total) = P(step 1) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nWe are looking for an option that lists a valid path with a probability of 1/3.\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The path is valid (assuming a typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules that dictate the allowed changes in the quantum numbers $l$ (orbital angular momentum) and $m$ (magnetic quantum number).\n*   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$. The parity of the wavefunction must change.\n*   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow$ Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $n' < n$:** The principal quantum number must decrease from $n=3$. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State $\\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\nLet's verify that a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For all possible values of $m'$, the change in $m$ is allowed ($0 - (-1) = +1$; $0 - 0 = 0$; $0 - 1 = -1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three paths, via each of the possible intermediate states, are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p level) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level) via a single-photon E1 transition. There are no other lower-energy states it can decay to. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the crucial part. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, and in the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\nThe total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n*   $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid path with the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: This option is malformed, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition (Initial to Intermediate):**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n    *   Let the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_i < n$:** The intermediate state must have $n_i < 3$. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i > 1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n_i=2$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition (Intermediate to Final):**\n    *   **Intermediate States:** $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ where $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_i = 0 - m_i$. For all possible values of $m_i$ ($-1, 0, 1$), the resulting $\\Delta m$ ($+1, 0, -1$) is allowed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways, via each of the intermediate states, are physically allowed according to the selection rules.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probability:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n    *   **First Step Probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. This symmetry implies that the decay to each of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m_i = -1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state is equally probable. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a single-photon E1 transition (as it's the only available lower energy level). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We have determined that any of the three paths (via intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$) is valid, and each has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $l$ (orbital angular momentum) and $m$ (magnetic quantum number):\n*   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$. The orbital angular momentum must change by exactly one unit.\n*   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$. The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one unit.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determine the Possible Decay Paths\n\nLet's trace the path from the initial state to the final state.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)**\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)**\n*   Let's verify if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For any of our possible intermediate states ($m' = -1, 0, 1$), the resulting $\\Delta m$ will be $+1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$, all of which are allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   Due to this symmetry, when the atom decays, the probability of it transitioning to any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state is exactly the same.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n*   Therefore, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these three paths is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of the second step (from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy level. Thus, the overall probability of the cascade is determined entirely by the first step.\n\n### 5.

Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules that dictate how the quantum numbers can change:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The change in the orbital quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Analyze the Two-Step Decay Path\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The full decay path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. Since the final state is $n=1$, the most likely intermediate state (and the one suggested by the options) is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible values of $m'$ (i.e., $\\Delta m$ can be $0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways, via the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are physically allowed according to the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p level) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level) via a single-photon dipole transition. There are no other lower energy levels it can decay to. Therefore, once the atom reaches the 2p level, it is guaranteed to decay to the 1s level. The probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the crucial part. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions), and there is no preference for which of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) it will transition to.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    *   $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and the final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying the selection rules:**\n    *   **l-selection:** The initial state has $l=0$.

The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means the intermediate state can have $m_i = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **n-selection:** The principal quantum number must decrease ($n_i < 3$). Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i > 1$. This leaves $n_i=2$.\n*   **Possible Intermediate States:** Combining these rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition\nThe atom decays from one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (where $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Checking the selection rules:**\n    *   **l-selection:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **m-selection:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed for all possible $m_i$ values ($-1, 0, 1$), as the result will be $1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways, via each of the intermediate states, are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$).\n*   In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m_i=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $|2,1\\rangle$ state is equal.\n*   Since there are three equally likely decay channels for the first step, the probability for any single channel is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The second step of the decay, from any $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ state, has only one possible lower-energy state to decay to via a dipole transition: the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   The total probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6.

We must first identify the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state (intermediate):** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $n''=1, l''=0, m''=0$.\n*   **Checking $\\Delta l$:** $\\Delta l = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n*   **Checking $\\Delta m$:** $\\Delta m = m'' - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed as long as $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which it is.\n\n**Conclusion on Paths:** All three potential pathways (via intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) are physically allowed by the selection rules. The paths listed in options A, C, and D are all valid.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Transition Probability\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state) via a single-photon E1 transition. There are no other lower energy levels it can decay to. Therefore, once the atom reaches the intermediate state, it is guaranteed to decay to the final state. The probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The overall probability of the cascade is therefore determined by the probability of the first step, i.e., the branching ratio for the decay $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is **spherically symmetric**.\n    *   In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Consequently, the decay to each of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $l'=1$ state must occur with **equal probability**.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n\nTherefore, the probability for each of the three valid decay routes is:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The path is valid.\n    *   The probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0⟩ to the ground state |1,0,0⟩. This is not a single transition but a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the changes in the quantum numbers must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   For emission, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n*   **Initial State**: |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1**: Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   **Applying n' < n**: The principal quantum number must decrease from n=3. Since the final state is n=1, a logical intermediate step is n'=2.\n\nCombining these points, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩\nLet's verify that a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate States**: |2,1,m'⟩ where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n*   **Final State**: |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1**: The change is l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1**: The change is m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. For all possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1), the resulting Δm (+1, 0, -1) is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This is a crucial point.\n*   Due to this symmetry, in the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   This means the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n*   Since there are three equally likely, mutually exclusive outcomes for the first transition, the probability for any single one of them is exactly **1/3**.\n\nThe probability of the second step (from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩) is 1, because this is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability of the two-step cascade is determined entirely by the probability of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid path with a probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. (**Correct path and probability**)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
