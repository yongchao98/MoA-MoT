    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has spin aligned with the +Z direction. In quantum mechanics, this state is represented by the eigenvector of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`, corresponding to the eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian of the Interaction:** The energy of a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`.\n\n3.  **Sudden Change in Magnetic Field:** Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. Suddenly, it is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. For `t > 0`, the new Hamiltonian is:\n    `H = -γ(S_x * B_x + S_y * B_y + S_z * B_z) = -γS_y * B`\n\n4.  **Time Evolution of the State:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a time `t`, `|ψ(t)>`, is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`. This is given by `<μz>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to calculating `γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = <+z| exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n    This expression describes the precession of the spin vector around the y-axis. The expectation value of `S_z` will oscillate as the spin vector, initially pointing along the z-axis, rotates in the x-z plane.\n\n6.  **Larmor Precession:** This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is given by `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>(t)`, will oscillate with this angular frequency. A detailed calculation shows that `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` in the argument of the cosine function, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
