    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the transition that the molecule undergoes.\n\n### 1. Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The molecule is initially in its fundamental (or ground) state, which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the vibrational quantum number `v = 0` and the rotational quantum number `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a diatomic molecule absorbing a single photon, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. The molecule starts at `J=0`, so a transition to `ΔJ = -1` is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)` is to the state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### 2. Energy of the Transition\n\nThe energy of the molecule in the non-rigid rotor model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n`E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia\n*   `v` and `J` are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) is equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states:\n\n`E_photon = ΔE = E(final) - E(initial) = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)`\n\nLet's calculate the energy of each state:\n*   `E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n*   `E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\nThe energy difference is:\n\n`ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\n**a) Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass `μ` for a diatomic molecule with atomic masses `Mx` and `My` is given by:\n`μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n`μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\nConverting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n`μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n**b) Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia `I` is `μR²`, where `R` is the bond length.\n`R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n`I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n**c) Calculate the Energy Components:**\n*   Vibrational term: `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   Rotational term: `ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n**d) Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n`ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n(Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n### 4. Photon Momentum\n\nThe relationship between a photon's energy `E` and its momentum `p` is `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\nTherefore, the momentum of the absorbed photon is:\n\n`p = ΔE / c`\n`p = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis value is approximately `1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nB) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\n\nThe calculated momentum matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
