    "The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon. The resulting alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to form the hydroxyl group. This protonation step requires an acid. A common way to carry out this reaction is to use NaCN with a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄, which is represented as H₃O⁺. This creates HCN *in situ* and provides the necessary acidic environment for the final protonation step.\n\nThe second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This transformation can be achieved by heating the nitrile with either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water. Using a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), directly yields the carboxylic acid. Using a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be significantly less effective for this hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable reagents are:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺** for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **B = HCl** for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
