    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents:\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their activating/deactivating and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating and ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles, and direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (Toluene):** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** Activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating and ortho-, para-directing groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing by induction (deactivating) but can donate electron density via resonance, directing incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating and meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating.\n\n### Isomer Distribution:\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected distribution of isomers for each group.\n\n**Meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2):**\nThese substituents direct the electrophile to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is highly disfavored.\n*   **4) Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** This is a very strong deactivating group. In nitration, it gives about 93% meta, 6% ortho, and less than 1% para. Bromination is similar, yielding almost entirely the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer.\n*   **6) Benzoic acid (-COOH):** This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination yields primarily m-bromobenzoic acid. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n*   **2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** Similar to benzoic acid, the ester group is deactivating and meta-directing. The yield of the para-isomer is expected to be very low.\n\nAmong these three, the -NO₂ group is the strongest deactivating group, leading to the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The -COOH and -COOC₂H₅ groups are also strongly deactivating. Generally, the order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. A stronger deactivating effect correlates with a lower yield of the minor (ortho, para) products. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3):**\nThese substituents direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is largely determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will favor the formation of the para-isomer to a greater extent.\n*   **1) Toluene (-CH₃):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene gives a mixture of ortho- and para-bromotoluene. The para-isomer is generally favored, but a significant amount of the ortho-isomer is also formed.\n*   **5) Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to its size and electronic properties, it gives a high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields a significant amount of p-bromochlorobenzene.\n\nComparing the ortho-, para-directors, the steric hindrance increases from -CH₃ to -C₂H₅, so the percentage of the para-isomer will be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene. The -Cl group, while deactivating, strongly favors the para position over the ortho position due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. Typically, halogenation of chlorobenzene gives a very high para/ortho ratio. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Ordering:\n\nCombining the two groups, we have the meta-directors with very low para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directors with much higher yields.\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
