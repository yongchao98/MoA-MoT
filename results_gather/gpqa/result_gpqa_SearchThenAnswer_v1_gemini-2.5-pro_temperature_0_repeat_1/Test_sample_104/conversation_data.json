    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the amplitude of the light curve due to starspots.**\n    The brightness of a star is proportional to the integral of flux over its visible disk. The flux (energy per unit area per unit time) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the effective temperature.\n\n    Let's denote the flux from the star when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer as F_max. This is our reference maximum brightness.\n    F_max ∝ A * σ * T_eff⁴\n    where A is the area of the star's visible disk.\n\n    When the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, a fraction of the disk (the filling factor, `f`) is covered by cooler spots. The flux observed is then F_min.\n    F_min ∝ A * [ (1 - f) * σ * T_eff⁴ + f * σ * T_spot⁴ ]\n\n    The amplitude of the photometric variation is the relative change in flux:\n    Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\n    Substituting the expressions for flux:\n    Amplitude_spots = ( AσT_eff⁴ - A[(1-f)σT_eff⁴ + fσT_spot⁴] ) / ( AσT_eff⁴ )\n\n    We can cancel out the common term Aσ:\n    Amplitude_spots = ( T_eff⁴ - (1-f)T_eff⁴ - fT_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude_spots = ( T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + fT_eff⁴ - fT_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude_spots = ( fT_eff⁴ - fT_spot⁴ ) / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude_spots = f * ( 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ )\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   Filling factor, f = 0.20\n    *   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * ( 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ )\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * ( 1 - (5/6)⁴ )\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * ( 1 - 625/1296 )\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * ( (1296 - 625) / 1296 )\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * ( 671 / 1296 )\n    Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\n    Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355\n\n2.  **Calculate the equivalent exoplanet radius.**\n    The dimming of a star's light caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equate the amplitudes and solve.**\n    To find the exoplanet size that produces the same signal amplitude, we set the two amplitudes equal:\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n    (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\n    Now, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\n    This value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
