    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### **Understanding the Notation**\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, A and B, in a star compared to the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[A/B] = log10(N_A/N_B)_star - log10(N_A/N_B)_sun`\n\nwhere `N_A` and `N_B` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\nA useful identity derived from this definition is:\n\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\nwhere H represents hydrogen.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. This is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundance fractions relative to hydrogen, which is `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the identity `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`, we can solve for `[Si/H]_1`:\n\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\nBy definition, `[Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the identity `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`, we can solve for `[Si/H]_2`:\n\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nBy definition, `[Si/H]_2 = log10(nSi/nH)_2 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances**\n\nWe want to find the ratio `R = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`. It is easier to first compute the logarithm of this ratio:\n\n`log10(R) = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 )`\n`log10(R) = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_2`\n\nWe can express `log10(nSi/nH)_star` in terms of `[Si/H]_star`:\n*   `log10(nSi/nH)_1 = [Si/H]_1 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun`\n*   `log10(nSi/nH)_2 = [Si/H]_2 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun = -0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun`\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for `log10(R)`:\n\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun)`\n`log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n`log10(R) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio R, we take the antilogarithm:\n\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Iron and Magnesium are not required for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
