    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which fits this description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:** Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating, which suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The release of a gas (W) whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons points strongly to Deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and its Reaction:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (deuterium) and reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas. A well-known reagent in organic chemistry that fits this description is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent that reacts violently with water. The reaction that produces D₂ gas would be LiAlD₄ reacting with heavy water (D₂O), which would be liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces deuterium gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would yield heavy water (B).\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Clue:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, would contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** Now we must find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
