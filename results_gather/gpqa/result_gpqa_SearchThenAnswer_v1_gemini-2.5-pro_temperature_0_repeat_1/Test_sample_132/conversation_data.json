    "The initial calculation was correct. The search results confirm the methodology.\n\n1.  **Identify the buffer components**: The solution contains KH2PO4 (which provides the weak acid, H2PO4-) and Na2HPO4 (which provides the conjugate base, HPO4^2-). This is a phosphate buffer.\n2.  **Determine the relevant equilibrium**: The equilibrium governing the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), which has a pKa2 of about 7.2. The equilibrium is H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.\n3.  **Calculate moles and concentrations**:\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (acid) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (base) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**: Using the equilibrium expression for Ka2, Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-].\n    *   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 / 0.02809)\n    *   [H+] = 8.109 x 10^-8 M.\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration**: The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. The equilibrium for this is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].\n    *   Rearranging for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+].\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809) / (8.109 x 10^-8)\n    *   [PO4^3-] = 6.235 x 10^-7 M.\n6.  **Compare with options**: The calculated value of 6.235 x 10^-7 M is closest to option D, 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nThe search results confirm that for a buffer solution containing H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the Ka2 equilibrium. The concentration of the fully deprotonated species, PO4^3-, is then found using the Ka3 equilibrium and the hydrogen ion concentration established by the buffer. The values for the dissociation constants provided in the problem are consistent with those found in the literature, although minor variations exist between sources. The overall method is sound.\n\nFinal check of calculations:\nMoles KH2PO4 = 1/136.09 = 0.00734808\nMoles Na2HPO4.2H2O = 1/177.99 = 0.00561829\n[H2PO4-] = 0.00734808 / 0.2 = 0.0367404 M\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561829 / 0.2 = 0.02809145 M\n[H+] = 6.2e-8 * (0.0367404 / 0.02809145) = 8.1091e-8 M\n[PO4^3-] = 1.8e-12 * (0.02809145 / 8.1091e-8) = 6.235e-7 M.\n\nThe calculation is robust. The answer is D.To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the resulting hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   The solution contains KH₂PO₄, which dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   The solution also contains Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which dissociates into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair forms a buffer. The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻; with Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    *   We can use the equilibrium constant expression for Ka₂ to find [H⁺]:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] = 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is produced in the third dissociation step:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻; with Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n    *   The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the value is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
