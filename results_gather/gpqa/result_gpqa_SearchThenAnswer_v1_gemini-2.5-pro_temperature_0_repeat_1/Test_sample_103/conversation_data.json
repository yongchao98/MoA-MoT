    "To determine the ratio of the orbital periods, we can use the formula for the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, K, which is the maximum velocity of the star along the line of sight.\n\nThe periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is caused by the star's motion, as described by the Doppler effect. The maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K:\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nGiven the periodic shifts for the two planets:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{P})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n(assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, which is true for a Neptune-mass planet and a Sun-like star).\n\nHere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n\nThe problem does not provide the inclination angles (i). In such problems, it is a standard assumption that the unknown factors are comparable, so we assume $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$.\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(2\\pi G / P_1)^{1/3} \\cdot (m_{p1} \\sin i_1 / M_{star1}^{2/3})}{(2\\pi G / P_2)^{1/3} \\cdot (m_{p2} \\sin i_2 / M_{star2}^{2/3})}$\n\nUnder the given conditions and our assumption, most terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(1/P_1)^{1/3}}{(1/P_2)^{1/3}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of K:\n$\\frac{5}{7} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_2/P_1$), we cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>"
