    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must first understand the energy levels of a single particle in such a well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for multiple particles.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L' are quantized and given by the formula:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of the n-th level can be expressed as:\n\nE_n = n²E\n\n### Multi-Particle System and the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions, and according to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level 'n' and its spin (either up or down). This means each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nFor the ground state, the four particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels.\n*   Two particles fill the n=1 energy level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the n=2 energy level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n**E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E**\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n**E_first_excited** = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n= (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\n= 2E + 4E + 9E\n= **15E**\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possibilities for promoting a particle from the ground state configuration:\n1.  **Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n2.  **Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy configuration after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nThe total energy of the second excited state is:\n**E_second_excited = 18E**\n\nTherefore, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
