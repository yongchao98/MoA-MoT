    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations simplifies the complex interactions within a nucleus by treating the constituent nucleons as if they are free particles during a high-energy interaction. This approximation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing the provided options:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is a fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. The incoming probe is assumed to interact with a single nucleon at a time, rather than with the nucleus as a whole or with multiple nucleons simultaneously. This is often referred to as the \"dilution assumption\".\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that the incoming probe and the struck nucleon do not undergo significant interactions with the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is also known as the transparency assumption, where the nuclear medium does not significantly affect the probe.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** The impulse approximation primarily deals with the interactions of nucleons as fundamental particles within the nucleus. The internal quark structure of the nucleon is generally not a direct consideration for this approximation to hold.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** This is a key aspect of the impulse approximation. The interaction is assumed to occur over a very short timescale, so the impulse from the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus is negligible compared to the impulse of the interaction itself. In essence, the nucleon is treated as a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are that the interaction is with a single nucleon, the rest of the nucleus is transparent to the interaction, and the nucleon's binding forces are negligible during the interaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
