  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the cause of the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\nFirst, the sequence is broken down into three-nucleotide codons to translate it into its corresponding amino acid sequence.\n\n1.  **Start Codon**: The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon for translation, coding for Methionine.\n2.  **Antigenic Determinant (HA Tag)**: The subsequent sequence is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`. The common DNA sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag is 5'-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3'. This translates to the amino acid sequence Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). The provided sequence matches this exactly, so there is no missense mutation in the tag. This rules out option A.\n3.  **Post-Tag Sequence**: Immediately following the HA tag sequence is the codon `AAA`, which codes for Lysine. The very next codon is `TGA`.\n4.  **Stop Codon**: In the standard genetic code, the codon `TGA` is a stop codon (also known as a termination or nonsense codon). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon during translation, it halts protein synthesis and releases the incomplete polypeptide chain.\n\nBecause of this premature stop codon located immediately after the HA tag, the ribosome would terminate translation, producing only a very short, non-functional peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This directly explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nEvaluating the other options:\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While linkers can sometimes be important for protein stability, the primary issue here is that the full protein is not being synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA`. Second, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs; they are recognized by release factors that terminate translation. All mammals, including mice (and the hamster cells used for transfection), recognize `UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA` as stop signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that the ribosome's early termination of translation is the cause of the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
