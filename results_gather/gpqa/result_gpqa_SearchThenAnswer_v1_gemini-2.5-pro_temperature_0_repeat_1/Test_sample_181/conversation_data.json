    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing these assumptions against the given options will reveal the correct statement.\n\nThe key conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-carrier device:** The current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes).\n*   **Trap-free:** The semiconductor is considered to be an insulator or intrinsic, with no charge-trapping states within the bandgap.\n*   **Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier):** The contacts are capable of supplying an unlimited number of charge carriers into the semiconductor, meaning there is no energy barrier to injection. A Schottky contact, which has a rectifying barrier, is not suitable.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current:** The current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the applied electric field. The contribution from the diffusion of carriers is considered negligible.\n\nBased on these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney law describes a current that is dominated by **drift**, not one where drift is negligible.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. The equation is specifically derived for a **single-carrier** device.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. The model assumes an **Ohmic contact** that provides an unlimited supply of carriers without a significant energy barrier, which is contrary to the nature of a Schottky contact.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately combines all the key requirements: it specifies a trap-free material, a single-carrier device, no injection barrier (which is the condition for an ideal Ohmic contact), and that the diffusion current is negligible.\n\n<<<D>>>"
