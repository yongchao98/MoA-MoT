    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources in the Energy Bands\n\nFirst, we need to identify which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands:\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The primary source of neutrinos in this range is the decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which is part of the pp-III branch. The CNO cycle also produces a small number of neutrinos in this band.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band receives neutrinos from three sources:\n    *   The decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`) from the pp-III branch.\n    *   The electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`), which produces a very strong, mono-energetic line of neutrinos at 861 keV. This reaction is part of the pp-II branch.\n    *   A small contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. The key consequence of this is the complete cessation of neutrino production from the decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`). All other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\n### 3. Determine the Remaining Fluxes\n\nWith the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, the fluxes in the two bands are now composed of the remaining sources:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining source is the CNO cycle. The flux in this band is therefore very low.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The contribution from `⁸B` disappears, but the very strong neutrino line from `⁷Be` at 861 keV remains. The CNO cycle also still contributes a small amount. The total flux in this band is overwhelmingly dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** This is a very small value, consisting only of a 100 keV-wide slice of the CNO neutrino spectrum.\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** This is a very large value, dominated by the entire flux of the `⁷Be` neutrino line, which is one of the most intense solar neutrino sources after the main pp-neutrinos.\n\nThe ratio is therefore a very small number divided by a very large number. This results in a value that is extremely close to zero.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n\nThe available options are:\nA) 10\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 1\nD) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\nGiven that the calculated ratio is a very small positive number, the closest plausible answer among the choices is 0.01. The other options are too large by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<B>>>"
