    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness of this peak is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with a broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key identifier. This mass corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. This provides strong evidence for the compound being a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Integration of Data and Structural Deduction\n\nThe combined data points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₀O) and B (C₆H₁₂O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: C₆H₁₀O₂ and C₆H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation Calculation\n\nTo differentiate between the remaining options, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The formula for a compound with the formula CₐHₑOₙ is:\n\nDoU = a - (b/2) + 1\n\n*   The structural features we've identified are:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond, which accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining molecular formulas:\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe calculated Degree of Unsaturation for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the two degrees of unsaturation required by the identified functional groups (one C=O and one C=C). The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ only allows for one degree of unsaturation, which would not account for both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid containing a carbon-carbon double bond. This structure corresponds to a molecular formula with two degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, the correct chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
