    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of covalent bond in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms, plus one for each double or triple bond. A simpler method is to count them directly from the structure. For a molecule with 12 carbons and 2 double bonds, there are a total of 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound)** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms. We need 22 moles of H atoms.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol (of H2) * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements)** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy of atomization of the elements minus the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements) - (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 * 12.01 g/mol) + (22 * 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.34 g/mol. For this problem, we can approximate with integer masses: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
