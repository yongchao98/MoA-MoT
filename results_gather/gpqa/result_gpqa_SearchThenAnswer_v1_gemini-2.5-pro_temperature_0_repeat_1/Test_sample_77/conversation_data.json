    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They are fundamental in classical electrodynamics for calculating the fields of moving charges, accounting for the finite speed of light.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time, $t_r$. This is the instant when the electromagnetic field was generated by the charge. The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t = t_r + d/c$, where $d$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general formulas for retarded potentials for continuous charge and current distributions and applies them to a point charge. The final expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all quantities in the brackets on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The terms are defined as:\n*   $q$ is the charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nBy factoring out $c$ from the denominator, the expressions can be rewritten as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option A. It is also noteworthy that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
