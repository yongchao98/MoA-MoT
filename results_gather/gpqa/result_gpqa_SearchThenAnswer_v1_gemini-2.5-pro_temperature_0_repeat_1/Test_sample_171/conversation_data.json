    "To solve this problem, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels in a system that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited state (energy E₂) and ground state (energy E₁), respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that we are observing the same specific energy level in iron atoms in two different stars. Let's denote the number of atoms in this excited state as N_excited and the number of atoms in the ground state as N_ground.\n\nFor star 1, with effective temperature T₁, the ratio of the populations is:\n\n(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor star 2, with effective temperature T₂, the ratio is:\n\n(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as in star 2. This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n\n(N_excited / N_ground)₁ / (N_excited / N_ground)₂ = 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:\n\n[ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ] = 2\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_excited / g_ground) is the same for both stars because it's the same atomic transition, so it cancels out:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) = 2\n\nUsing the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ] = 2\n\nFactoring out the common term -ΔE/k:\n\nexp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ] = 2\n\nNow, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\nWe can rewrite the term in the parenthesis with a common denominator:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\n1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ln(2) = [ T₂ / T₁]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T₁ + T₂) / (T1*T2)]\nC) ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T1*T2)]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T1*T2)² ]\n\nThe derived equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
