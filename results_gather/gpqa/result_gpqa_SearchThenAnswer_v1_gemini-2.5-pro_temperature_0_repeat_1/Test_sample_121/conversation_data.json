    "The search results confirm the feasibility of the reaction sequence. Specifically, the reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with 1,5-dibromopentane is a known method for synthesizing ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The final product is commercially available, and its structure is confirmed as ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nMy analysis of the structure and its symmetry for the 1H NMR spectrum prediction is as follows:\n\n*   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, and the substituents, assuming rapid chair conformation changes which average the proton environments.\n*   **Distinct Proton Environments:**\n    1.  **Ethyl -CH2-:** The two methylene protons of the ethyl group are equivalent. They will appear as one signal.\n    2.  **Ethyl -CH3:** The three methyl protons of the ethyl group are equivalent. They will appear as a second signal.\n    3.  **Cyclohexane C2/C6:** The four protons on these two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. This will be the third signal.\n    4.  **Cyclohexane C3/C5:** The four protons on these two carbons are also equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. This will be the fourth signal.\n    5.  **Cyclohexane C4:** The two protons on this carbon are unique and equivalent to each other. This will be the fifth signal.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 distinct hydrogen signals. This matches my initial deduction.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 5\nD) 12\n\nMy derived answer is 5, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThe reaction steps are chemically sound:\n1.  **Î±-bromination:** Acetic acid is converted to 2-bromoacetic acid.\n2.  **Fischer Esterification:** 2-bromoacetic acid is converted to ethyl 2-bromoacetate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2):** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate is converted to ethyl 2-cyanoacetate.\n4.  **Double Alkylation / Cyclization:** Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate is deprotonated by the strong base NaH. The resulting carbanion undergoes a nucleophilic attack on one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. A second deprotonation by excess NaH is followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form the 6-membered ring of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThe final structure is confirmed. The counting of signals based on chemical equivalence and symmetry is correct. There are 2 signals from the ethyl group and 3 signals from the cyclohexane ring protons, for a total of 5 signals.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
