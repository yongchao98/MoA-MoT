    "This is a classic problem involving the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay. Radioactive decay follows this principle, which means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability for any future period.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let S(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t. The decay probability is P(t) = 1 - S(t). The survival probability follows an exponential decay law: S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the survival probability S(100) is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the formula: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n\n3.  **Address the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Because the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes of survival are irrelevant to the future probability. We simply need to calculate the probability of decay for a fresh 150-minute interval.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We need to find P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n    *   From step 2, we know that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n    *   Therefore, S(150) = (0.68)^1.5.\n    *   S(150) ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
