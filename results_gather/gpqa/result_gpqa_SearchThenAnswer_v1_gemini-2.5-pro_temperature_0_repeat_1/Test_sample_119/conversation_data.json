    "Let's analyze the relationship between the number of stars and parallax under the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `d`. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n2.  **Volume of Space:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell, `dV`, is given by the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n\n3.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem assumes that stars are uniformly distributed throughout space. This implies that the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume. Therefore, the number of stars, `dN`, within the thin spherical shell is proportional to the volume of the shell:\n    `dN ∝ d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Relating to Parallax:** To understand how the number of stars changes with parallax, we need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`. From the parallax-distance relationship `d = 1 / plx`, we can find the relationship between a small change in distance (`dd`) and a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`) by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1 / plx^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship, so we can write `dd ∝ (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** Now, we can substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)^2 * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we look at the ratio `dN / d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\nThis demonstrates that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
