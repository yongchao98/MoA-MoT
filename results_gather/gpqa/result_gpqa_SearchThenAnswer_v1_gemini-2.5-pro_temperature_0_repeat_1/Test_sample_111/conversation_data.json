    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State |alpha>\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. To work with this state, we first need to normalize it. Let the normalized state be `|alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\nThe bra corresponding to `|alpha>` is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`.\n\nSo, `<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`.\nUsing the fact that `(a+ib)(a-ib) = a^2 + b^2`:\n`|C|^2 * [(1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2)] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * [2 + 5] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * 7 = 1`\n`|C| = 1/sqrt(7)`\n\nChoosing the real, positive value for C, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. Finding the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This gives the 2x2 matrix:\n\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0`\n    `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [a, b] = 0`\n    This gives the equation `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The eigenstate is proportional to `[1, 1]`.\n    The normalized eigenstate is `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0`\n    `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [a, b] = 0`\n    This gives the equation `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The eigenstate is proportional to `[1, -1]`.\n    The normalized eigenstate is `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P(v_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate |v₁> (P₁)**:\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |3 / sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate |v₂> (P₂)**:\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [-1 + 2i]`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. An alternative way is to use the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = 4*hbar / 28 = hbar / 7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
