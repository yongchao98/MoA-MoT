    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n\n*   The percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n    (Mass of 2n H atoms) / (Mass of n C atoms + Mass of 2n H atoms) = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   This confirms that Z is a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions**\n*   **Mixture X** is composed of two unsaturated liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds.\n*   When heated with a platinum catalyst, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Mixture Y** does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst.\n*   **Hydrogenation** of both mixture X (unsaturated) and mixture Y under \"severe conditions\" yields only cyclohexane (Z). The severe conditions are necessary to hydrogenate the aromatic component of mixture Y.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture Y**\nSince the hydrogenation of mixture Y produces only cyclohexane (C6H12), its components must have a C6 carbon skeleton. We also know that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y. The other component must be the product of an oxidation (dehydrogenation) part of the disproportionation, which also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This substance is benzene (C6H6).\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**4. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\nThe transformation from mixture X to mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction where hydrogen atoms are transferred between molecules. The overall reaction can be represented as:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) â†’ Cyclohexane + Benzene (Mixture Y)\n\n*   Since mixture Y is equimolar, the reaction is 1:1:1:1.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total atoms in Mixture Y = (6 C + 12 H) + (6 C + 6 H) = 12 C + 18 H.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C6H12), they must both be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The components of X are unsaturated. The most likely candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check the atom count: C6H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n*   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. This rules out cyclohexa-1,3-diene, leaving **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** as the diene component. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond and thus no conjugation.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
