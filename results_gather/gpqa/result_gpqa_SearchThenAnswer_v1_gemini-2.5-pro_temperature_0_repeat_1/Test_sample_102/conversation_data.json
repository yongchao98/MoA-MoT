    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other, presents a challenge. A straightforward approach where substituents are added one by one is often complicated by conflicting directing effects or severe deactivation of the ring.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes:\n\n1.  **Initial Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This is a good first step as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which can help establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This reaction introduces the acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Introduction of the Second and Third Groups:** Now, a nitro group and a bromo group must be added to the acetophenone ring at the 3 and 5 positions. We can consider two possibilities for the second step: nitration or bromination.\n\n    *   **Path A: Nitration followed by Bromination**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 5. The nitro group also directs the incoming bromine to position 5 (which is *meta* to its own position). Since both groups direct the substitution to the same carbon, this step should proceed with high regioselectivity to yield the desired product. Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two groups, the reinforcing directing effects make this a viable pathway for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n    *   **Path B: Bromination followed by Nitration**\n        *   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromo group to the *meta* position.\n        *   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, the ring has an acetyl group (meta-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (*ortho, para*-director) at position 3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Because the directing effects are not reinforcing, a mixture of products could potentially form, making this route less efficient for a high-yield synthesis compared to Path A.\n\n### Conclusion based on Chemical Principles:\nThe most logical and high-yield direct synthesis involves:\n1.  Friedel-Crafts Acylation of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  Nitration of acetophenone to form 3-nitroacetophenone.\n3.  Bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone to form the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the provided options. The options are complex and include reduction and diazotization steps, which are often used to overcome directing group conflicts or to introduce groups that cannot be added directly. However, upon detailed analysis:\n*   Options A, C, and D contain steps that are either nonsensical (like creating and then immediately removing a functional group to return to the starting material) or chemically impossible (like performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or aniline under acidic conditions).\n*   Option B begins with the sequence: **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4**. This corresponds to the less efficient \"Path B\" discussed above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem to describe a different, unrelated synthesis that would ultimately fail to produce the target molecule.\n\nThere appears to be a significant flaw in the construction of the options provided. However, if forced to choose the *best* starting sequence that could theoretically lead to the product, the initial steps are the most critical. The sequence of acylation, followed by two successive electrophilic aromatic substitutions, is the correct strategy. The sequence in Path A (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is superior in terms of regioselectivity. None of the options list this exact sequence. The sequence in Path B (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) is plausible, although potentially lower-yielding. This sequence matches the beginning of option B. Given the flaws in the other options, option B presents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, starting point.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the intended sequence was Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination. Or, that despite the conflicting directing effects, the sequence Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration is considered viable. The additional steps (iv-vii) in option B are extraneous and incorrect for the synthesis of the target compound. Based on the initial plausible steps, B is the only choice that starts correctly with a Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
