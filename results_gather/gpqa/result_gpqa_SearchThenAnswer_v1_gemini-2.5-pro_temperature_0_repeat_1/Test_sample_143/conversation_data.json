    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Calculate the lifetime (τ) of the X meson in its rest frame:**\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its decay width (Γ) by the uncertainty principle, where the formula is:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nHere, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\nGiven the decay width Γ_X = 320 MeV, the lifetime is:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) describes the time dilation and length contraction for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\nGiven the production energy E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV, the Lorentz factor is:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\n**3. Calculate the velocity (β) of the X meson:**\n\nThe velocity of the particle is expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, denoted by β (v/c). It can be calculated from the Lorentz factor using the following relation:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\nRearranging for β, we get:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n**4. Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity (v = βc) during its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula is:\nd = γ * β * c * τ\nUsing the values calculated above and the speed of light c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\nd ≈ (20/3) * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
