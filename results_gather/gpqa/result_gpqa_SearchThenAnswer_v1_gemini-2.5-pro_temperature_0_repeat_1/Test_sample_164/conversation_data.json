    "An analysis of the four statements reveals the following:\n\n*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is correct. Major chemical companies have developed and licensed technologies that use dual-catalyst or multi-reactor systems to produce polyethylene with tailored properties, such as bimodal molecular weight distribution, which includes controlled branching. For instance, Univation Technologies offers PRODIGY™ Bimodal HDPE Catalysts, which are multi-component systems used in a single reactor. Similarly, Chevron Phillips Chemical licenses the MarTECH™ Advanced Dual Loop (ADL) technology, which uses two reactors in series to produce bimodal polyethylene.\n\n*   **B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is also correct. The key step to creating branches from ethylene alone is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form short alpha-olefins (e.g., 1-hexene, 1-octene), which are then co-polymerized. Chromium (a Group VIa metal) catalysts are exceptionally effective and commercially used for this specific purpose. Research has detailed tandem catalyst systems that pair a chromium-based oligomerization catalyst with a polymerization catalyst to produce branched polyethylene from a single ethylene feedstock. In fact, Phillips developed a chromium catalyst capable of synthesizing the comonomer from ethylene *in situ*.\n\n*   **C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is incorrect. The oligomerization of ethylene by catalysts, including chromium-based ones, typically requires a co-catalyst or activator. Aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and other organoaluminum reagents (e.g., triethylaluminum), are widely used and are often essential for activating the catalyst.\n\n*   **D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is correct. Palladium (a noble metal) catalysts have been shown to effectively catalyze the oligomerization or polymerization of ethylene to form highly branched structures. However, the high cost of noble metals is a significant barrier to their use in the large-scale production of commodity plastics like polyethylene, making catalysts based on more abundant metals like chromium and zirconium more economically viable.\n\nBoth statements A, B, and D are factually correct. However, statement B describes the specific, fundamental chemistry that enables the technology mentioned in statement A. The industrial processes often rely on the principle of using a catalyst like a Group VIa metal to perform the necessary oligomerization. Therefore, statement B is a more fundamental and direct chemical answer to the problem posed.\n\n<<<B>>>"
