    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the molecular ion peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. All the proposed options (A, B, C, and D) have a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option B (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester/acid chloride and lacks the O-H group of a carboxylic acid, and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is an aldehyde/phenol. While an aldehyde has a C=O group and a phenol has an O-H group, the combination of the extremely broad O-H stretch and the C=O position strongly indicates a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This singlet, appearing far downfield, is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). They appear as two distinct doublets, with each signal integrating to two protons. This specific pattern (two doublets, 2H each) is a hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different (in this case, -COOH and -Cl), causing the protons on either side to experience slightly different electronic environments.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Final Options\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted benzene ring. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. It contains a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom. This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular weight with a chlorine isotope pattern, the IR signals for a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR signals for a *para*-substituted aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid proton.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all the spectral data, the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
