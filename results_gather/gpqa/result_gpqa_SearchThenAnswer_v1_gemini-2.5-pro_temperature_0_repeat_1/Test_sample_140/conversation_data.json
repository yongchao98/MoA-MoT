    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton (H) or a deuteron (D) from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, resulting in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at the C2 position remains in this intermediate. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is favored, but both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The NH2- group adds to C1. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The NH2- group adds to C6. This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **From benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2: Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the NH2- group at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
