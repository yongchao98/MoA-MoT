    "In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), not all fundamental symmetries are required to be preserved by every operator. The framework is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. These new operators must, however, adhere to certain fundamental symmetries of the underlying theory.\n\n**1. Lorentz Symmetry:** All operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz invariant. This is a fundamental requirement of any relativistic quantum field theory, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.\n\n**2. Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT Lagrangian is built to be invariant under Poincaré transformations, which include both Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. This is a core principle in the construction of the theory.\n\n**3. CP Symmetry:** SMEFT allows for new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. There is a significant area of research dedicated to classifying and studying these CP-violating operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n**4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it is expected to respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on these principles, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
