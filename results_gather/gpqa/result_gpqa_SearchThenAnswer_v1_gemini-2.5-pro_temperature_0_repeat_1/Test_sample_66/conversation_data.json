    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where the magnetic quantum numbers are `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this notation:\n*   `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum (`L_1z` and `L_2z`) projects the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by `|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2>`.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in a specific uncoupled state `|1, m_1, 1, m_2>` after the measurement is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the initial and final states:\n`P(m_1, m_2) = |<1, m_1, 1, m_2 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n\nThe term `<1, m_1, 1, m_2 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are essentially the expansion coefficients when a state in the coupled basis is written as a linear combination of states in the uncoupled basis.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers add up, i.e., `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\nIn this problem, we are interested in the outcome where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this satisfies the selection rule with the given total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince `m = -1` and `m_1 + m_2 = -2`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not met. This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this specific transition is zero:\n`<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0`\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring `L_1z = -ħ` (which corresponds to `m_1 = -1`) and `L_2z = -ħ` (which corresponds to `m_2 = -1`) is:\n`P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0`\n\nThis result is physically intuitive. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components (`L_z = L_1z + L_2z`). If the system is in a state with a total z-component eigenvalue of `-ħ` (since `m=-1`), it is impossible to find it in a state where the sum of the individual components is `-2ħ` (from `m_1=-1` and `m_2=-1`), as this would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the measurement projection.\n\n<<<C>>>"
