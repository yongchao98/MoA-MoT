    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations using methods that involve approximating the matrix exponential function, the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one hinges on the mathematical properties of the approximation used. A common and effective technique is to use a rational approximation for the matrix exponential function.\n\nThe key to parallelizing the computation lies in the ability to decompose this rational approximation into a sum of simpler fractions, a method known as partial fraction decomposition. This decomposition breaks down a large, complex problem into several smaller, independent sub-problems. Each of these sub-problems can then be solved simultaneously on different processors.\n\nSpecifically, a rational function with distinct real poles can be expressed as a sum of terms, where each term involves a simple denominator. This structure allows the original matrix problem to be split into a series of independent linear systems that can be solved in parallel. This process of using a linear partial fraction expansion is the crucial step that enables the distribution of the computational workload across multiple processors, thus transforming a sequential process into a parallel one.\n\nWhile stability analysis is vital for ensuring the numerical method produces a valid solution, and the nature of the roots (real vs. complex) affects the implementation (real arithmetic is preferred), neither is the direct mechanism for enabling parallelism. Nonlocal boundary conditions describe the physical problem itself, not the computational strategy for parallelization. Therefore, the decomposition of the fractional approximation is the essential factor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
