    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, a proton must be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   The α-carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no protons.\n    *   The α-carbon at position 6 has one methyl group and one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible enolate forms by removing the proton from C6. The bulky t-BuOK base abstracts this proton to create a C1-C6 enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate is a nucleophile, and ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule (`-CH=CH-COOEt`).\n4.  **Product Structure**: A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety. The resulting product is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n5.  **Product Naming (A)**: To determine the correct IUPAC name from the options, we can name the product by treating the complex cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The parent chain is the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is attached to the third carbon of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclic substituent, we number its carbons starting from the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone) as C1'.\n    *   C1' has a methyl group.\n    *   C2' is the original C1, which is the carbonyl group (`-oxo`).\n    *   C3' is the original C2, which has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: In 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`), the protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (C1) are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic C1 of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n4.  **Product Structure**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming (B)**: The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the compound is named as a nitrile derivative.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `C6H3-C5H2-C4H(NO2)-C3H(CH3)-C2H2-C1N`\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the full name for product B as **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
