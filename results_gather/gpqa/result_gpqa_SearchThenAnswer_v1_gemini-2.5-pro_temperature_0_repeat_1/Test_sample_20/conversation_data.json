    "Based on the analysis of the compounds:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it generally requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom on a saturated (sp³ hybridized) carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond (sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, their removal is energetically unfavorable as it would lead to a highly unstable ring structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH₂-) located between the carbonyl groups. These are saturated carbons containing alpha-hydrogens. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
