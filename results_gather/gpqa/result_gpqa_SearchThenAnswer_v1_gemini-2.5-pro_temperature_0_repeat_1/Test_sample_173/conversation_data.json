    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   Sum of rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Solving for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Solving for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `E_m1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `E_m2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   Total kinetic energy (`T_total`): `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p1 = p2 = p` (in magnitude).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the classical kinetic energies is:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nFor relativistic calculations, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy of a fragment is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   So, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nEquating the two expressions:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nNow, simplify the equation to solve for `T1`:\n*   `396 * T1 = -204 * T1 + 603`\n*   `600 * T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
