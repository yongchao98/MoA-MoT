    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two main criteria must be met: the star must be bright enough for both instruments, and it must be visible in the sky from both observatories.\n\n### Observational Requirements\n\n*   **Brightness Limit:** The ESPRESSO spectrograph can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17. The HIRES spectrograph's limit is an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16. Therefore, to be observed by both, a star must satisfy the stricter requirement, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.\n*   **Location Visibility:** The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude approx. -24° S), and the W. M. Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude approx. +20° N). A star is visible from a specific latitude if its declination (celestial latitude) is within a certain range. For a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must lie in the overlapping zone, which is approximately between -70° and +66°.\n\n### Star Analysis\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) of a star is calculated from its absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and any interstellar absorption (A_V) using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log₁₀(d/10) + A_V. The absorption is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\nHere is a star-by-star evaluation:\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Location:** Declination (DEC) = -75°. This is too far south and outside the common visibility range for the Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = +55°. This is within the common visibility range.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is within the common visibility range.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the V < 16 limit. The additional information about color excess is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is given.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the common visibility range.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude must be calculated.\n        *   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   Apparent V magnitude (m) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is fainter than the V < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is within the common visibility range.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude must be calculated.\n        *   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 0 mag\n        *   Apparent V magnitude (m) = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
