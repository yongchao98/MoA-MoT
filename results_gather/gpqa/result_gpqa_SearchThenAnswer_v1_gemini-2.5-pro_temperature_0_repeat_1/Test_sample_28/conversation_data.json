    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must determine which change would most probably result in a non-functional protein. The gene's function is to synthesize the compound, so a non-functional protein product would eliminate it.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code and the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon. The subsequent codons are read in groups of three: `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), and so on.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence changes from `...TTTCTC...` to `...TTCTAC...`.\n    *   The second codon changes from `TTT` to `TTC`. Both codons specify the amino acid Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence changes from `...TTTCTC...` to `...TTCTAA...`.\n    *   The second codon changes from `TTT` to `TTC` (Phenylalanine), a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, resulting in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. In this case, only a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment would be produced.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence shows multiple changes: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...` becomes `...TAC GCT GGT GTC...`.\n    *   This results in multiple **missense mutations**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine. While multiple amino acid changes are more likely to disrupt protein function than a single change, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence changes from `...CTC GCT GGT...` to `...TAC GCT ACT...`.\n    *   This also causes two **missense mutations**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine and Glycine to Threonine. Similar to the other missense mutations, this may or may not completely inactivate the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to ensure a gene produces a non-functional protein is to introduce a premature stop codon early in its sequence. Mutant 2 contains a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the third position. This will lead to a severely shortened protein that is highly unlikely to have any function. The other mutations are missense mutations, which only change amino acids and are less certain to completely eliminate the protein's activity.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
