    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰, we must first calculate the particle's average decay length in the laboratory frame and then determine the distance required to observe the specified fraction of decays.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, relates the time and length measurements between the particle's rest frame and the laboratory frame. It is calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass (m).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest mass m = 3.41 GeV/c²\n\nThe formula for the Lorentz factor is:\nγ = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying. It depends on the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀), its velocity (v), and the Lorentz factor (γ). The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor (τ = γτ₀).\n\nThe mean decay length (L) can be calculated using the formula:\nL = v * γ * τ₀\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the particle's momentum (p) and mass (m):\nL = (p/m) * c * τ₀\n\nFirst, we calculate the momentum `p`:\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\np = sqrt(E² - m²) / c = sqrt(27² - 3.41²) GeV/c ≈ 26.78 GeV/c\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean decay length L:\n*   Proper lifetime τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   Speed of light c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n\nL = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\nL ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\nL ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Determining the Required Resolution\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance `d` is given by P(d) = e^(-d/L).\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This can be interpreted as needing to resolve the tracks of the 30% of particles that travel the furthest before decaying. Therefore, we need to find the distance `d` for which the probability of survival is 30% (or 0.3).\n\nP(d) = e^(-d/L) = 0.3\n\nTo find `d`, we solve for it:\n-d/L = ln(0.3)\nd = -L * ln(0.3)\nd ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\nd ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThis calculated value of 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m is closest to option A. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values or options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
