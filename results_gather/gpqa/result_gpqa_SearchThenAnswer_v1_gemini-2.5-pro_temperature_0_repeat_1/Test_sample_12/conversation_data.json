    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n(R)-(+)-Limonene has two carbon-carbon double bonds. The reaction with one equivalent of hydrogen (H₂) in the presence of a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst results in the selective hydrogenation of the less substituted double bond. The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group, while the more substituted double bond within the cyclohexene ring remains. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C4.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which has an (R) configuration at C4, with the isopropenyl group commonly depicted on a wedge.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene. The isopropyl group remains on a wedge.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a reagent used for the epoxidation of alkenes. The epoxidation occurs at the remaining double bond within the ring. The stereochemical outcome is directed by the bulky isopropyl group at C4. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA molecule approaches from the face of the ring *syn* (on the same side as) the equatorial isopropyl group, which is sterically more accessible than the *anti* face.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The epoxide ring is formed on the top face (wedge), syn to the wedged isopropyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile. In basic or nucleophilic conditions, the ring-opening of an epoxide on a cyclohexane ring is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile (methoxide, MeO⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide (C2). The attack occurs from the face opposite to the epoxide ring (a \"backside\" attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n\n*   **Epoxide:** The oxygen is on the wedge (top face).\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The methoxide ion attacks C2 from the dash (bottom face).\n*   **Product 3:** This results in a trans-diol-like product. The new methoxy group at C2 is on a dash, and the resulting hydroxyl group at C1 is on a wedge. The stereochemistry of the unchanged centers remains the same. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexanol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\nProduct 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This set of reagents is used for a Steglich esterification, a mild method for forming an ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The reaction converts the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 into a propionate ester (-O-C(=O)CH₂CH₃). This reaction does not alter the configuration of any of the stereocenters.\n\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
