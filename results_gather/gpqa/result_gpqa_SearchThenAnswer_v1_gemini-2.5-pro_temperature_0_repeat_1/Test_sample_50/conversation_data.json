    "To solve this problem, we use the method of images. A charge *q* placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image\" charge, *q'*, placed at a specific location inside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Determine the image charge and its position:**\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge *q'* is placed along the line connecting the center and the external charge *q*.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   The position of the image charge from the center is: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy:**\n    The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d* from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge *q'*.\n\n    It is a key result from electrostatic theory that the potential energy of interaction between a real charge and the induced charges on a grounded conductor is one-half of the interaction energy between the real charge and its image charge.\n\n    First, let's calculate the interaction potential energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*. The distance between them is `d - d'`.\n\n    `d - d' = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    The interaction potential energy, `U_interaction`, between two point charges is given by `k * q1 * q2 / r`.\n    `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - d')`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for *q'* and `(d - d')`:\n    `U_interaction = k * q * (- (R/d) * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `U_interaction = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `U_interaction = - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The net potential energy of the system, *U*, is half of this interaction energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    `U = (1/2) * [- k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
