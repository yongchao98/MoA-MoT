    "The reaction in question is a [4+2] cycloaddition, specifically a Diels-Alder reaction, between 2,5-dimethylthiophene (the diene) and furan-2,5-dione, also known as maleic anhydride (the dienophile). The reaction is conducted under heat. The question asks to identify the *exo* product.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a conjugated diene (2,5-dimethylthiophene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic Diels-Alder reaction, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Product's Basic Structure**: The cycloaddition occurs between the four carbons of the thiophene ring and the two carbons of the double bond in maleic anhydride. This process forms a new six-membered ring. The sulfur atom from the thiophene and the carbons it was originally bonded to form a bridge in the new bicyclic system. This is known as an \"epithio\" bridge. The maleic anhydride part becomes an isobenzofuran-1,3-dione structure. Therefore, the base name of the product will be **4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**. This eliminates options B and D, which incorrectly name the structure.\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between Endo and Exo Products**: In Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienophiles, two stereoisomers, *endo* and *exo*, can be formed.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically formed faster (kinetically favored) due to secondary orbital interactions, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride moiety) are positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the main bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system.\n    *   The *exo* product is generally more stable (thermodynamically favored) because it minimizes steric hindrance. In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride moiety is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the sulfur bridge. The question specifically asks for the *exo* product, which is often favored at higher temperatures.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Exo Product**:\n    *   We are left with options A and C, which only differ in their stereochemical descriptors.\n        *   A) (3aR,4R,7S,7aS)\n        *   C) (3aR,4S,7R,7aS)\n    *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the sulfur bridge. This means the methyl groups at positions C4 and C7 are on the same side of the molecule as the sulfur bridge.\n    *   Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to the stereocenters for this *exo* arrangement gives the following configuration (or its enantiomer): At C4 the configuration is S, and at C7 it is R. The hydrogens at the ring junction (C3a and C7a) are also on the same side as the sulfur bridge, leading to configurations of R at C3a and S at C7a.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical descriptor for one of the enantiomers of the *exo* product is **(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
