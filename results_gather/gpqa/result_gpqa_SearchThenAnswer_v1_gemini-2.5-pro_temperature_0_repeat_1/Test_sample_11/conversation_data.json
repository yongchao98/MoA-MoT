    "The calculations I performed are consistent with the information found in the search results.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Search result confirms the decay π⁻ → μ⁻ + ν̅μ. It calculates the total energy released as 33.9 MeV, which matches my Q-value calculation. It then calculates the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) to be 4.1 MeV and the energy of the neutrino (E_ν) to be 29.8 MeV.\n- Search result also confirms that for a two-particle decay from a stationary particle, the products have definite energies. It states the kinetic energy of the muon is measured at 4.13 MeV.\n- Search result provides a detailed solution for the same problem (using slightly different mass values, 273 me and 207 me, where me = 0.511 MeV, which gives m_pi = 139.5 MeV and m_mu = 105.8 MeV). Their results are KE_mu = 4.08 MeV and KE_nu = 29.65 MeV, which are very close to my calculated values and the values in option A.\n- Search result shows the derivation for the momentum of the neutrino, which matches the formula I used, and calculates it to be 29.84 MeV/c.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion (m_π * c²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν (assuming the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy).\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. The final products must have equal and opposite momenta.\n    |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:\n    For the muon: E_μ² = (p_μ * c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    For the massless neutrino: E_ν = p_ν * c = p * c\n\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    From the conservation laws, we can derive the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) and the neutrino (KE_ν).\n    KE_ν = p * c = [(m_π² - m_μ²) * c⁴] / [2 * m_π * c²]\n    KE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6] MeV\n    KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2 MeV\n    KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n    The total energy released (Q-value) is the sum of the kinetic energies:\n    Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c²\n    Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV - Matches my calculation.\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV - Incorrect.\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV - Incorrect.\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV - Incorrect.\n\nThe answer is A.In the decay of a stationary particle into two product particles, the kinetic energies of the products can be determined using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion. After the decay, the energy is shared between the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu).\n\n*   Initial Energy (E_initial) = m_π * c²\n*   Final Energy (E_final) = E_μ + E_ν = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν\n\nEquating initial and final energy:\nm_π * c² = KE_μ + m_μ * c² + KE_ν\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is:\nKE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π - m_μ) * c²\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Calculation of Kinetic Energies:**\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²), we can derive the energies of the individual particles.\n\nFor the massless neutrino, its energy is entirely kinetic:\nE_ν = KE_ν = p * c\n\nFor the muon:\nE_μ = KE_μ + m_μ * c²\n\nFrom the conservation laws, the kinetic energy of the neutrino can be calculated as:\nKE_ν = [(m_π² - m_μ²) * c⁴] / (2 * m_π * c²)\nKE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / (2 * 139.6) MeV\nKE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2 MeV\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 MeV\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon:\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This result is consistent with established experimental values and calculations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
