    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨Sy⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), the following steps are taken.\n\nFirst, the given spin state, let's call it |ψ⟩, must be normalized. A quantum state is normalized when its inner product with itself equals one. The normalization constant, A, is calculated as follows:\n\n|A|² * [(3i)*(-3i) + 4*4] = 1\n|A|² * [9 + 16] = 1\n|A|² * 25 = 1\nA = 1/5\n\nTherefore, the normalized spin state is:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4)\n\nNext, the spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is defined as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix.\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\nThe expectation value ⟨Sy⟩ is then calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩. The term ⟨ψ| represents the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state vector |ψ⟩ (ket).\n\n⟨ψ| = (1/5) * (-3i, 4)\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  First, apply the S_y operator to the state vector |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -i \\\\\n    i & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n     * (1/5) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    3i \\\\\n    4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n     = (ħ/10) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -4i \\\\\n    -3\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n\n2.  Then, take the inner product with the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (1/5) * (-3i, 4) * (ħ/10) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -4i \\\\\n    -3\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [12i² - 12]\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-12 - 12]\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = -24ħ/50\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = -12ħ/25\n\nThis result matches a solved problem with the identical spin state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
