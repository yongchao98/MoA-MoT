    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The search results confirm the fundamental concepts I used.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle (`t`) as observed in a stationary frame (like the detector) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ`, its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is `t = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Particle Decay Law:** The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by an exponential decay law: `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`. This is equivalent to the fraction of particles remaining, `N/N₀`.\n*   **Travel Time:** For ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time taken to travel a distance `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n\nCombining these, the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall at radius `R` is:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nThis confirms that the formula used in the initial reasoning was correct.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation again to ensure accuracy:\n\n1.  **Set up the equation:**\n    The fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is given by `exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`. The term `c * τ` is the mean decay length in the particle's rest frame, which is a constant for this type of particle.\n\n2.  **Use the first condition to find a relationship:**\n    *   Given: `γ₁ = 20`, `R = 30 m`, and `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n    *   Taking the natural log of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    *   `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    *   `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\n3.  **Use the second condition to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`:**\n    *   Goal: Find `γ₂` when `N/N₀ = 2/3` and `R = 30 m`.\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n    *   Taking the natural log of both sides: `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    *   `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    *   `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n4.  **Solve for `γ₂` by combining the two conditions:**\n    From the first condition, we can write `c * τ = 1.5 / ln(3)`.\n    Substitute this into the equation from the second condition:\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n    `ln(3/2) = (30 * ln(3)) / (γ₂ * 1.5)`\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 28\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.2 strongly indicates that 54 is the correct answer.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive is given by the formula `N/N₀ = exp(-t / (γτ))`, where `t` is the travel time in the lab frame (`R/c`), `γ` is the Lorentz factor, and `τ` is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n**Initial state:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n*   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n\nUsing the decay formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`\n\n**Target state:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\nUsing the decay formula again:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`\n2) `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n\nWe can solve for `γ₂` by dividing the second equation by the first:\n`(ln(3/2)) / (ln(3)) = (30 / (γ₂ * cτ)) / (1.5 / (cτ))`\n`(ln(3/2)) / (ln(3)) = (30 / γ₂) * (1 / 1.5)`\n`(ln(3/2)) / (ln(3)) = 20 / γ₂`\n\nNow, rearrange to solve for γ₂:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
