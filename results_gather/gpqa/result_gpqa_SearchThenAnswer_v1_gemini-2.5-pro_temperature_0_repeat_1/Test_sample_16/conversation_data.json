    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (stability constant) is K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), also known as the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table (ICE table) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe dissociation constant expression is:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the complex is very stable, and the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This means that the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
