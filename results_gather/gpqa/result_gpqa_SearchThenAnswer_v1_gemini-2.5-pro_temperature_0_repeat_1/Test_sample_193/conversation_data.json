    "To find the partition function Z for the given system of three spins, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each of the three spins (S1, S2, S3) can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates:\n\n1.  **All spins are the same:**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There are 2 states with an energy of -3J.\n\n2.  **Two spins are +1 and one is -1:**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    There are 3 states with an energy of J.\n\n3.  **One spin is +1 and two are -1:**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    There are 3 states with an energy of J.\n\nIn summary, we have two distinct energy levels with their corresponding degeneracies (number of states with that energy):\n*   An energy level E1 = -3J with a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   An energy level E2 = J with a degeneracy g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states. It can be calculated by summing over the energy levels, taking into account their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
