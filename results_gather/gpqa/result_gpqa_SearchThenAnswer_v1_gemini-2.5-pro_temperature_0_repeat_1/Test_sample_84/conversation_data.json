    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2):\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**2. Relating Doppler Shift to Semi-Major Axis**\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) is caused by the star's radial velocity (v_r) as it wobbles due to the planet's gravitational pull. The maximum radial velocity, or velocity amplitude (K), is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) by:\n\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n\nWhere 'c' is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and the semi-major axis (a) by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, M_p << M_star):\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n\na ≈ G * M_star * (M_p / (K * M_star))²\na ≈ (G / M_star) * (M_p / K)²\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2 / K₂)²] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1 / K₁)²]\n\nThe terms (G / M_star) cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**4. Substituting the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, let's find the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Since K is directly proportional to Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ₀), the ratio K₁ / K₂ is the same as the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n*   K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**5. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
