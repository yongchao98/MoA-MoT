    "The search results confirm the relationship between the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary and its period and radial velocity amplitudes. Specifically, for an eclipsing binary, the inclination is near 90 degrees, simplifying the mass calculation.\n\nThe total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) can be derived from Kepler's Third Law, and for a spectroscopic binary, it is related to the observational quantities by the formula:\n\nM_total ‚àù P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\nwhere P is the orbital period and K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\nHere is the data for the two systems:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitude (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitude (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   Total radial velocity amplitude (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitude (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitude (K2b) = 10 km/s\n*   Total radial velocity amplitude (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system 1 to the mass of system 2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2), we can set up the following proportion:\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = (P1 * (K_total1)^3) / (P2 * (K_total2)^3)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = (2 years * (15 km/s)^3) / (1 year * (25 km/s)^3)\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 2 * (15/25)^3\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 2 * (3/5)^3\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 54 / 125\n\n(M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
