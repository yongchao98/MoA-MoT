    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the System and Conservation of Energy**\n    We have a particle of rest mass $m$ attached to a spring that obeys Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The motion is confined to one dimension, and the maximum amplitude of the oscillation is $A$.\n\n    In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle under a potential U is given by the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy (K) and its potential energy (U). This total energy is conserved.\n    $E_{total} = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The potential energy of the spring is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n    At the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude), $x = A$, the particle momentarily stops. Therefore, its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    When $v = 0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0}} = 1$.\n    The kinetic energy at this point is $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    So, the total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Speed**\n    The particle reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n    At this point, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The velocity is $v = v_{max}$, and the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    So, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n    Since the total energy of the system is conserved, we can equate the total energy at maximum amplitude with the total energy at maximum speed.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Invert both sides of the equation:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by taking the square root and multiplying by $c$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    This result matches option D. As a check, in the non-relativistic limit where $c \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ approaches zero. The expression then simplifies to the classical result $v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\n\nThe correct expression for the maximum speed is given by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
