    "An analysis of the mathematical expression provided reveals the number of loops in the corresponding Feynman diagram.\n\nIn quantum field theory, the calculation of a Feynman diagram's contribution to a physical process involves an integration over any loop momenta that are not fixed by the external momenta. For a diagram with `L` loops in four-dimensional spacetime, the calculation will involve `L` separate integrations over these loop momenta.\n\nA standard result of performing these integrations is that each loop contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression. Therefore, for a diagram with `L` loops, one would expect to find a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this to the general formula, we can set up the following equation:\n\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nThis implies that `2L = 6`, which solves to `L = 3`.\n\nThe other factors in the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram:\n*   `alpha^3` and `g^2` are related to the coupling constants at the vertices of the diagram.\n*   `(Q/M)^2` represents a ratio of energy scales involved in the process.\n*   The numerical constants (`sqrt(2)` and `8`) arise from the specific topology and symmetry of the diagram.\n\nHowever, the power of `1/(4pi)` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops. Thus, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
