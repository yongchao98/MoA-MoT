    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis, determining the limiting magnitude of the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the specified conditions and then calculating the apparent magnitude and checking the visibility of each listed star from the Paranal Observatory.\n\n### Step 1: Determine ESPRESSO's Detection Limit\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved in a 1-hour exposure using a single 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope (UT).\n\nAccording to technical documentation for ESPRESSO, in the single-telescope High-Resolution mode (singleHR), the instrument can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of 16.3 in a 20-minute exposure.\n\nTo find the limiting magnitude for a 1-hour (60-minute) exposure, we can use the principle that the S/N ratio is proportional to the square root of the exposure time. To maintain the same S/N for a fainter object, the increase in required exposure time is related to the brightness ratio. A simpler approach is to calculate the magnitude gain from a longer exposure. The relationship between the change in magnitude (Δm) and the ratio of exposure times (t1, t2) for a constant S/N is:\n\nΔm = 2.5 * log10(t2 / t1)\n\nHere, t1 = 20 minutes and t2 = 60 minutes.\n\nΔm = 2.5 * log10(60 / 20) = 2.5 * log10(3) ≈ 2.5 * 0.477 ≈ 1.19 magnitudes.\n\nThis means with a 1-hour exposure, we can detect a star that is about 1.19 magnitudes fainter than we could in 20 minutes.\n\nLimiting Magnitude (1-hour) ≈ 16.3 + 1.19 = **17.49**.\n\nTherefore, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is approximately **17.5 or brighter**.\n\n### Step 2: Check Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. A celestial object is only visible from a given latitude if its declination (δ) is less than 90° minus the absolute value of the latitude.\n\nVisibility Limit for Paranal ≈ 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°.\n\nThis means any star with a declination greater than +65.4° will never rise above the horizon and is therefore impossible to observe.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\nNow, we evaluate each star against the criteria for magnitude and visibility.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is about -52° 41'. This is easily visible from Paranal in the southern sky.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since -0.74 is much brighter than 17.5, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about +1.98.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is approximately +89° 15'. This is far north of the +65.4° visibility limit for Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is not visible from the VLT. It is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** The relationship between absolute magnitude (M_V), apparent magnitude (m_V), and distance (d) in parsecs is given by the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10).\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = **15.0**.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is given as 0°, which is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 15.0 is brighter than 17.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = **21.5**.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is 0°, which is visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 21.5 is fainter than 17.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = **13.5**.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is 0°, which is visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 13.5 is brighter than 17.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = **18.5**.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is 0°, which is visible.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 18.5 is fainter than 17.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n### Final Count\n\nThe stars that would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc\n3.  Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc\n\nIn total, **3** of the listed stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
