    "The problem considers an N-sided polygonal aperture where N becomes infinitely large. An N-sided regular polygon with an infinite number of sides is equivalent to a circle. The apothem 'a' of this polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem is to find the angular distance between the first two minima of a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The angular positions of the minima in this pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by:\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / D\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the aperture, and 'm' is a coefficient determined by the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nThe diameter of the aperture is D = 2a.\n\nThe angular positions of the first and second minima are given by:\nsin(θ₁) ≈ θ₁ = 1.22 * λ / D = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\nsin(θ₂) ≈ θ₂ = 2.23 * λ / D = 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance *between* these first two minima, which is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is closest to 0.506 λ / a. The small discrepancy arises from using rounded values for the coefficients (1.22 and 2.23). A more precise calculation uses the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function directly. The first zero is at approximately 3.8317 and the second is at approximately 7.0156.\n\nThe angular position θ is more accurately given by θ ≈ (zero * λ) / (π * D) = (zero * λ) / (2π * a).\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance is:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
