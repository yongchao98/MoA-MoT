    "This question requires comparing two different types of mean free paths within the same environment:\n\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of a gas molecule before it collides with another gas molecule.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the beam before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n\nThe key to solving this lies in the formulas for the mean free path, which depend on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is generally defined as λ = 1 / (nσ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n1.  **For λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):** When calculating the mean free path for a gas molecule among its peers, we must account for the fact that all molecules are in random motion. This consideration of relative motion introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the denominator. The formula is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ)\n    where 'n' is the number density of gas molecules and 'σ' is the collision cross-section for two molecules.\n\n2.  **For λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):** The electron is accelerated to 1000 kV, giving it a velocity vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. In this case, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. The formula for a fast particle moving through stationary targets does not have the √2 factor. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ')\n    Here, 'n' is the same gas molecule density, and σ' is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n**Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n\nThe collision cross-section is dominated by the size of the larger particle, which in both cases is the gas molecule. Therefore, we can approximate that the collision cross-section σ is roughly equal to the electron-molecule scattering cross-section σ' (σ ≈ σ').\n\nWith this approximation, we can compare the two mean free paths:\n*   λ2 ≈ 1 / (n * σ)\n*   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ)\n\nFrom this, we can see the relationship:\nλ2 ≈ √2 * λ1\n\nSince the square root of 2 is approximately 1.414, we have λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1. This means that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\nLooking at the given options:\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect, as our factor is ~1.414.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct, as 1.414 is greater than or equal to 1.22.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect because the collision dynamics are different.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect.\n\nThe mean free path for the high-energy electron (λ2) is longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) because the electron's high velocity makes the target gas molecules effectively stationary, removing the √2 factor present in the formula for λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
