    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, we need to determine the shortest wavelength of light that can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes. This is because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen occurs at a rest wavelength (λ_emitted) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), which is in the UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum. For this absorption line to be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope, its wavelength must be stretched, or redshifted, into the optical range that can penetrate the atmosphere.\n\nThe relationship between the emitted wavelength, the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\nλ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)\n\nThe optical window for ground-based telescopes, the range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere, begins at approximately 3800 Å to 4000 Å. Any light with a shorter wavelength is largely absorbed by the atmosphere. Therefore, the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted to at least this wavelength to be observed from the ground.\n\nUsing the lower end of this practical range, let's set the minimum observable wavelength to be around 4130 Å. We can now calculate the corresponding redshift:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\nz = (4130 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.4 - 1\nz ≈ 2.4\n\nThis calculation shows that a redshift of about 2.4 would move the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line to approximately 4134 Å, which is within the violet range of the visible spectrum detectable by ground-based telescopes. While detection at slightly lower redshifts (and thus shorter wavelengths) might be possible from very high, dry sites, a redshift of around 2.4 represents a more practical lower limit for consistent detection.\n\n<<<A>>>"
