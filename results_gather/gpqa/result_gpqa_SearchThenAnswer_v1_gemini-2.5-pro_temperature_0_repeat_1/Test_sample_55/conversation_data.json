    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\n**1. Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nThe allowed transitions must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1.\n*   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, n, but for spontaneous emission, the energy of the atom must decrease, so the final n must be less than the initial n.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Decay Path:**\nThe atom starts in the state |3,0,0> and decays to |1,0,0> in two steps. Let the intermediate state be |n',l',m'>.\n\n*   **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, we must have l' = 1.\n        *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   n' < 3. The problem implies a cascade through the n=2 state, so we consider n'=2.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n*   **Second Transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Final state: n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0.\n    *   Let's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states (|2,1,m'>) to the final state is allowed:\n        *   Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule.\n        *   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1>: Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state |2,1,0>: Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state |2,1,1>: Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   Thus, all three pathways are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**3. Calculating the Transition Probability:**\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to any of the three possible m' sublevels of the l'=1 state is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is the sum of the probabilities to each of the m' states. Since these probabilities are equal, the probability for any one specific path is 1/3.\n\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate |2,1,m'> states, it must decay to the |1,0,0> state to complete the two-step transition to the ground state. The transition from any |2,1,m'> state to |1,0,0> is an allowed transition, and it is the only possible dipole transition to the n=1 shell. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1, conditioned on the first step having occurred.\n\nThe overall probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\nB) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{3} (Correct route and probability)\nC) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\nD) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{2}{3} (Malformed and incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
