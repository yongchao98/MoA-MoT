    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Step 1: Compound A to Compound B**\n    Compound A has the formula C3H6, which corresponds to either propene or cyclopropane. Since it undergoes bromination in carbon tetrachloride, an addition reaction, Compound A must be **propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**. The reaction adds bromine across the double bond.\n    *   CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2/CCl4 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Compound B to Compound C**\n    Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), which causes dehydrohalogenation (elimination of HBr). With two bromine atoms, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    *   CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   **Compound C is propyne.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Compound C to Compound D**\n    When propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes cyclic polymerization. Three molecules of propyne trimerize to form a stable aromatic compound.\n    *   3 CH3-C≡CH → 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   **Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene).**\n\n*   **Step 4: Compound D to Compound E**\n    Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard condition for nitration (conc. HNO3 and conc. H2SO4). This adds a nitro group (-NO2) to the benzene ring.\n    *   C6H3(CH3)3 + HNO3/H2SO4 → C6H2(CH3)3(NO2) + H2O\n    *   **Compound E is 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Step 5: Compound E to Compound F**\n    Compound E (a nitroaromatic compound) is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   C6H2(CH3)3(NO2) + Fe/HCl → C6H2(CH3)3(NH2)\n    *   **Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine).**\n\n*   **Step 6: Compound F to Compound G**\n    Compound F (an aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) in a diazotization reaction to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   C6H2(CH3)3(NH2) + HNO2 → [C6H2(CH3)3N2]+\n    *   **Compound G is the 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt.**\n\n*   **Step 7: Compound G to Compound H**\n    The diazonium salt (Compound G) reacts with sodium hydroxide (and water, upon warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.\n    *   [C6H2(CH3)3N2]+ + H2O/NaOH → C6H2(CH3)3(OH) + N2\n    *   **Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its high symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent and will produce another single signal. Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. Propyne is a gas at room temperature (boiling point -23.1 °C) and is known to be a highly flammable gas. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are widely used as intermediates in the synthesis of dyes, particularly azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow-brown. However, phenols with bulky groups at the ortho positions (like the two methyl groups in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol) are sterically hindered. This hindrance often prevents the formation of the colored complex, resulting in no color change, meaning the solution remains the yellow color of the reagent. A yellow color is not the characteristic positive result (violet/blue/green) for this test. Therefore, stating it *gives* a yellow color is misleading in the context of a positive chemical test and is considered an incorrect description of the expected outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
