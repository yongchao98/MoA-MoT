    "The problem at hand is a physics calculation based on the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of its surface covered by spots is not needed for the core calculation.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (N₂/N₁) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\nFactor = [(N₂ / N₁)_nospots] / [(N₂ / N₁)_spots]\n\nThe temperatures are given as:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out when we take the ratio of the two expressions. The equation for the factor simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (E₂ - E₁) / k * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\nThe energy difference (E₂ - E₁) can be calculated from the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å) of the transition using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy difference in a convenient unit, electron volts (eV). The product hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å.\n\nE₂ - E₁ = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV\n\nNext, we need the value of the Boltzmann constant (k) in eV/K, which is approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n\nNow, we can calculate the term (E₂ - E₁) / k:\n\n(E₂ - E₁) / k ≈ 8.56 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99338 K\n\nFinally, we plug this value into the equation for the factor:\n\nFactor = exp[ 99338 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99338 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99338 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99338 / 66000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.505)\nFactor ≈ 4.5\n\nThus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energetic levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.\n\n<<<C>>>"
