    "To solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information and then match it to the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deducing the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents. The base formula for the ring portion is C₆H₄.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group within one of the substituents.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** This means a halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. This halogen atom is one of the two substituents.\n\nSince one substituent is a halogen (which contains no carbon atoms), the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom and an acetyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe structure, a haloacetophenone, should have two types of proton signals in its 1H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. They should appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet) integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone is around 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n2.  **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** There are four protons on the di-substituted ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern depend on the relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This signal is a singlet integrating to three protons at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group and the halogen create a symmetrical electronic environment that splits the four aromatic protons into two distinct pairs. For example, the 1H NMR spectrum of 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals at 7.61-7.63 ppm and 7.83-7.84 ppm. This option is highly consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option also lacks the characteristic signals for a di-substituted aromatic ring with four protons. The integration values (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) sum to 7 protons, which is inconsistent with the proposed structure. This option is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. Option B provides the only 1H NMR data that correctly describes this structure: a singlet for the three acetyl protons around 2.3 ppm and two doublets for the four aromatic protons, which is indicative of para-substitution.\n\n<<<B>>>"
