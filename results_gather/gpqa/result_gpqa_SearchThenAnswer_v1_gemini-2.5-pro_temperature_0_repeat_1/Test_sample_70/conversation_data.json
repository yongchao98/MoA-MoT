    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**: The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (r). This can be expressed as:\n    T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the same as the orbital distance (a = r). Therefore:\n    P² ∝ r³\n    This can be rearranged to show the relationship between the orbital distance and the period:\n    r ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Relating Temperature and Period**: By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature formula, we can find the relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\n    T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio**: Now we can set up a ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios**: The problem states the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 (P2) is 2.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 (P4) is 3.5.\n\n    The ratio of their periods is:\n    P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 1 / 1.205\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
