    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n    *   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH-), the moles of OH- are:\n        Moles of OH- = 0.090 mol × 2 = 0.180 mol.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong base (OH-) will react with all available acidic protons. It will first neutralize the strong acid (H+ from HCl) and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n    *   **Total moles of acid available for reaction:**\n        Total acid = Moles of H+ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH\n        Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n    *   **Compare total acid with total base:**\n        We have 0.180 mol of OH- and 0.130 mol of total acid. Since the moles of the strong base are greater than the total moles of acid, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n    *   **Calculate the moles of excess OH-:**\n        Excess OH- = Initial moles of OH- - Total moles of acid\n        Excess OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-:**\n    First, find the total volume of the mixed solution.\n    *   **Total Volume:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n    *   **Concentration of OH-:**\n        [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution:**\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH-]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
