    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, meaning all its protons are chemically equivalent. The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give the single ¹H NMR peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene, two carbonyl) give the two ¹³C NMR peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This molecule has a five-membered ring with double bonds between carbons 1-2 and 3-4, methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a CH₂ group at carbon 5.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is thermodynamically more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Structure and ¹H NMR Assignments of Products:**\n    The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. We can predict the approximate ¹H NMR signals based on the structure:\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the new six-membered ring. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead carbons (carbons where the rings are fused). They are also equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons from the original maleic anhydride are now part of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent and adjacent to the carbonyl groups. This gives a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons from the CH₂ group of the diene now form the one-carbon bridge (C7). They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). One is *syn* (closer to the double bond) and the other is *anti* (further from the double bond). They will appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Analysis:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak that is present in the **major (*endo*) product** but absent or weak in the **minor (*exo*) product**.\n\n5.  **Spatial Relationships in Endo vs. Exo Isomers:**\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the one-carbon bridge. In this orientation, the **anhydride protons** are spatially close to the ***anti* bridge proton**.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the one-carbon bridge. In this orientation, the **anhydride protons** are far from the *anti* bridge proton but are close to the *syn* bridge proton and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H):** These protons are relatively close in both isomers. This cross-peak would not be unique to the major product.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me):** These groups are far apart in both isomers. No significant cross-peak is expected.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H):** This proximity exists in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is described.\n    *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H):**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons are close to the *anti* bridge proton. This will produce a NOESY cross-peak.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the *anti* bridge proton (they are close to the *syn* proton instead).\n        *   Therefore, a cross-peak connecting the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and one specific bridge proton (~1.5 ppm, which must be the *anti* proton) will be present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum.\n\nThis analysis matches the experimental observation described in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>"
