    "The search results confirm my initial analysis of the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane reagents are often used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH3 is an electrophilic reducing agent that coordinates to the electron-rich carbonyl oxygen. It is one of the best methods for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH4 is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4.\n\nNow, let's apply this confirmed selectivity to the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH4 → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** A is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu).\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 reacts with the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH3 → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** B is also (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 (originally from the C1 carboxyl group that was reduced) attacks the ester carbonyl at C1 (originally C5) in an intramolecular transesterification. This process forms the lactone and releases isobutanol.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions occur at the functional groups and do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check:\n- Reaction A: (R)-starting material + LiBH4 (ester reduction) -> (R)-lactone. Correct.\n- Reaction B: (S)-starting material + BH3 (acid reduction) -> (S)-lactone. Correct.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.<<<B>>>"
