    "Based on the principles of electrochemistry, the correct completion of the statement is:\n\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Thermodynamics: Weaker in Basic Solutions**\n    The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher, more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard potential of **+1.23 V**.\n    *   In a basic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard potential of **+0.40 V**.\n    Since the standard reduction potential is significantly lower in a basic solution (+0.40 V) compared to an acidic one (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a weaker oxidizing agent in basic media.\n\n*   **Kinetics: Slower in Acidic Solutions**\n    The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are notoriously complex and often slow. This sluggishness is a major reason for the large overpotential (the difference between the thermodynamic potential and the actual potential at which the reaction occurs at a significant rate) observed in systems like fuel cells. Studies have shown that the oxygen reduction reaction is particularly slow and kinetically challenging in acidic environments. In fact, the reaction is often carried out in basic solutions to help speed up the process.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is **weaker – slower**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
