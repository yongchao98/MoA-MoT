    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nTo determine the correct option, we must calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using the principles of special relativity.\n\n#### Relative Speed\n\nThe relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic velocities is not a simple subtraction of their speeds. Instead, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let the velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) be v₁ = 0.6c and the velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m) be v₂ = 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction relative to a stationary observer.\n\nThe velocity of the second astronaut as observed from the first astronaut's reference frame (v_rel) is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v₂ - v₁) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = -0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ -0.1428c\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. The negative sign indicates that from the perspective of the faster astronaut, the slower astronaut appears to be moving backward.\n\n#### Total Energy\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, v₁ = 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ₁ = 1 / √0.64\nγ₁ = 1 / 0.8\nγ₁ = 1.25\n\nNow, we calculate the energy (E₁):\n\nE₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c²\nE₁ = 1.25 * 2mc²\nE₁ = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, v₂ = 0.5c):**\n\nNext, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ₂ = 1 / √0.75\nγ₂ ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, we calculate the energy (E₂):\n\nE₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c²\nE₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc²\nE₂ ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies:\n\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\nE_total = 5.964 mc²\n\nComparing our calculated values (v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²) with the given options, we find that option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
