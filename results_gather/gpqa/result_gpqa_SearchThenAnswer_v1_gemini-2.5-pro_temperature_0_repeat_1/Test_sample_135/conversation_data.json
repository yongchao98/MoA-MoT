    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∫(∇⋅**f**)dV, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field **f** is purely radial and its magnitude is given by f(r) = 1/r².\n\nThis problem can be solved in two ways: by direct calculation of the divergence or by using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The formula for the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is:\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * fᵣ)/∂r + ... (terms involving angular derivatives, which are zero since the field is purely radial).\n\nHere, the radial component fᵣ is 1/r². Substituting this into the formula:\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r\n∇⋅**f** = 0\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence of the field is zero for all r ≠ 0. However, at the origin (r=0), the field itself is undefined, indicating a singularity. A direct integration of ∇⋅**f** = 0 over the volume would yield 0, which is incorrect because it fails to account for the singularity at the origin. The divergence at the origin is in fact a Dirac delta function, which makes this method more complex.\n\n### Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a more straightforward approach by relating the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states:\n\n∫ᵥ (∇⋅**f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, V is the volume of the sphere of radius R, and S is its surface.\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the vector field is **f** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **The surface element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element d**S** points in the outward radial direction, so d**S** = **r̂** dA = **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n3.  **The dot product:** The dot product **f** ⋅ d**S** is:\n    (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [**r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ]\n    Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the expression simplifies to:\n    (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n4.  **The surface integral (Flux):** Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle θ are 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are 0 to 2π.\n\n    ∮ₛ d**S** = ∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n    First, integrating with respect to θ:\n    ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n\n    Next, integrating with respect to φ:\n    ∫₀²π (2) dφ = 2 [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2(2π) = 4π.\n\nThe result of the surface integral is 4π. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. This result is independent of the radius R, as long as the sphere encloses the origin. This is a key feature of inverse-square law fields, as described by Gauss's Law for fields like gravity or electricity.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated value is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
