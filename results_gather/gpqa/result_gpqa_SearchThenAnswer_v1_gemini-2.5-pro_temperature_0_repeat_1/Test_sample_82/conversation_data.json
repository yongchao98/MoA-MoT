    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume × Molarity = 0.02000 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:**\n    20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH reacted:** 0.001 mol × 25% = 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:** 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer solution.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n*   **pKa:** -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The solution's pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which acts as a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Moles of acid / Molarity of base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis reaction:** CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we first need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n*   **Kb calculation:** Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, we calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] produced by the hydrolysis.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
