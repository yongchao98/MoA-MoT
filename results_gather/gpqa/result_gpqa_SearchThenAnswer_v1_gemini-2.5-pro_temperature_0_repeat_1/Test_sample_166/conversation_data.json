    "To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state, we use the relative entropy measure. The final value is approximately 1.38.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the State and Density Matrix:**\n    The Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n    `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n    For the given values `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state simplifies to an odd cat state:\n    `|psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-2*alpha^2)))`\n    The density matrix for this state is `rho = |psi><psi|`. Since this represents a pure state, its von Neumann entropy, `S(rho) = -Tr(rho * ln(rho))`, is zero.\n\n2.  **Define Non-Gaussianity (nG):**\n    The non-Gaussianity is measured by the relative entropy between the state `rho` and a reference Gaussian state `tau`. The prompt defines this measure as `del_b = Tr(rho*ln(rho)) - Tr(tau*ln(tau))`. This can be rewritten in terms of von Neumann entropies (`S(rho) = -Tr(rho*ln(rho))`) as:\n    `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n    Since `S(rho) = 0`, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reference Gaussian State (`tau`):**\n    The reference Gaussian state `tau` is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state `rho`.\n    *   **First Moment (Mean Displacement):** The mean displacement `<a>` for this specific cat state is zero.\n    *   **Second Moments:** We need to calculate the expectation values `<a^2>` and `<a^\\dagger a>`. For the given state, these are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<a^\\dagger a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`:**\n    The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its covariance matrix. The determinant of the covariance matrix for this state is found to be:\n    `det(V) = (alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2) + 1/2)^2 - (alpha^2)^2`\n    The entropy `S(tau)` is then calculated using the symplectic eigenvalue `lambda = sqrt(det(V))`:\n    `S(tau) = (lambda + 1/2) * ln(lambda + 1/2) - (lambda - 1/2) * ln(lambda - 1/2)`\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Substituting `alpha = 0.5` (so `alpha^2 = 0.25`):\n    *   `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`\n    *   `det(V) ≈ (0.25 * 4.083 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25^2 ≈ 1.52075^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3127 - 0.0625 = 2.2502`\n    *   `lambda = sqrt(2.2502) ≈ 1.500`\n\n    Now, we calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) ≈ (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) ≈ 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   `S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 - 0 = 1.3862`\n\nThe amount of non-Gaussianity is therefore approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<C>>>"
