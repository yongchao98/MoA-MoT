    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will still exhibit transit and occultation events, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Understand the Transit Conditions\n\nA planet transits its star when its orbit is aligned in such a way that it passes in front of the star from our line of sight. For a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation (when the planet passes behind the star) will also occur.\n\nThe key geometric value is the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the point of closest approach, normalized by the star's radius. A transit where the planet's center passes across the star's disk requires the impact parameter to be `b ≤ 1`.\n\nThe impact parameter is defined as:\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane's normal and the line of sight).\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the star.\n\n### 2. Use Planet 1 to Find the System's Inclination\n\nWe are given that the first planet has an orbital period `P1 = 3` days and an impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination `i`.\n\nFor Planet 1:\n`b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the system's geometry:\n`cos(i) / R_s = 0.2 / a1`\n\n### 3. Determine the Maximum Orbit for Planet 2\n\nFor the second planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter, `b2`, must be at most 1. The maximum possible value for the impact parameter that allows for a non-grazing transit is `b2 = 1`.\n\nFor Planet 2, the condition is:\n`b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s ≤ 1`\n\nNow, we substitute the geometric relationship we found from Planet 1 into this inequality:\n`a2 * (0.2 / a1) ≤ 1`\n\nSolving for the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a2 / a1`):\n`a2 / a1 ≤ 1 / 0.2`\n`a2 / a1 ≤ 5`\n\nThis means the semi-major axis of the second planet can be at most 5 times that of the first planet.\n\n### 4. Apply Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). For two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio:\n`(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n\nWe can rearrange this to relate the ratio of the semi-major axes to the ratio of the periods:\n`a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Maximum Period for Planet 2\n\nNow, we combine the result from the transit condition with Kepler's Third Law:\n`(P2 / P1)^(2/3) ≤ 5`\n\nTo find the maximum period `P2`, we solve for `P2 / P1`:\n`P2 / P1 ≤ 5^(3/2)`\n`P2 / P1 ≤ sqrt(5³) = sqrt(125)`\n`P2 / P1 ≤ 11.18`\n\nFinally, we calculate the maximum orbital period for Planet 2 using the known period of Planet 1 (`P1 = 3` days):\n`P2 ≤ 3 * 11.18`\n`P2 ≤ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star were not needed for this calculation, as the stellar radius term cancelled out.\n\n<<<B>>>"
