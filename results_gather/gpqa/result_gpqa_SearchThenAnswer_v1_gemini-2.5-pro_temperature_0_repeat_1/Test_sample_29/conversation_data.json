    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:**\n    The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. We can convert this energy to wavelength using the formula E = hc/λ, where:\n    *   E is the energy (in Joules)\n    *   h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   λ is the wavelength (in meters)\n\n    First, convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to Joules (J):\n    1 eV = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n    E = 2.3393 eV * (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) ≈ 3.7476 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\n    Now, rearrange the formula to solve for wavelength (λ):\n    λ = hc / E\n    λ = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (3.7476 x 10⁻¹⁹ J)\n    λ ≈ 5.304 x 10⁻⁷ meters\n\n    To make this value easier to interpret, we convert it to nanometers (nm):\n    λ ≈ 530.4 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:**\n    A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light:**\n    The color that a compound absorbs is the complementary color of the color it transmits or emits. When a substance absorbs a particular color from white light, our eyes perceive the combination of the remaining colors, which is the complementary color. The complementary color to green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
