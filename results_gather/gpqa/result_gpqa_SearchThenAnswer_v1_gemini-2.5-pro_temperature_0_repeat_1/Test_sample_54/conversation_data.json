    "To identify the unknown compound, a detailed analysis of the provided 1H NMR data is necessary. The data points to a specific isomer among the choices by revealing the connectivity and spatial arrangement of the atoms.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, which means the three protons it represents have no adjacent protons to couple with. Its chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates (containing a -O-C(=O)-CH₃ group), so this signal confirms the presence of the acetate functional group.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet, indicating that the three protons of this methyl group are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This methyl group must be attached to a carbon that has one hydrogen on it, such as a C=CH-CH₃ arrangement.\n\n3.  **Signals in the Alkene Region (5.0-7.0 ppm):** These signals are from protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond (vinylic protons).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet representing one vinylic proton. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, *J*, which is 16.0 Hz. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons provides information about their relative geometry. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz, is characteristic of protons that are in a *trans* configuration to each other across the double bond. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-12 Hz. This strongly indicates that the unknown compound has a *trans* double bond, eliminating the *cis* isomers (B and D).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for one proton is a doublet of quartets. This complex splitting pattern means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to one other proton (the vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm). The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be the methyl group that appears as a doublet at 1.6 ppm.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\n*   The data confirms an acetate group.\n*   The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) confirms a *trans* double bond.\n*   We have a methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=). This methyl group's signal is the doublet at 1.6 ppm, and it splits the adjacent vinylic proton into a quartet.\n*   The vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is split by both the other vinylic proton (*trans* to it) and the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is only split by the other vinylic proton, resulting in a doublet.\n\nThis collection of fragments can only be assembled in one way that matches the data: **Trans-propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n\n*   **Trans-butenyl acetate** is incorrect because it would have a different number of signals or different splitting patterns due to the presence of an additional CH₂ group (in the case of trans-but-2-enyl acetate) or a CH₂CH₃ group (in the case of trans-but-1-enyl acetate).\n\nTherefore, the data unequivocally identifies the compound as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
