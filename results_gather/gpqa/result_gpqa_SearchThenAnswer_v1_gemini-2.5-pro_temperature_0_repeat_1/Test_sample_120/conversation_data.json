    "To determine the product of the reaction, we must analyze the starting material, the reagent, and the reaction mechanism, paying close attention to regioselectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound with an epoxide ring fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n2.  **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n3.  **Reaction**: The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate is a nucleophilic substitution (Sɴ2) reaction. The key principles are:\n    *   **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked, a characteristic of the Sɴ2 mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the site of attack**: The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the ring carbons and the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon and will be the site of the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group from Me₂CuLi.\n\n2.  **Determine the product's structure**: The attack of the methyl group on C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is standard), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   A hydroxyl group is formed at C1.\n    *   When naming the final product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. The old C6 becomes the new C2. This results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol structure. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **Determine the stereochemistry of the product**:\n    *   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting material has an (S) configuration at C6. Therefore, the configuration at this carbon in the product (which is the new C2) must be (R).\n    *   The chiral centers not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) are expected to retain their original configurations.\n    *   Let's trace the configurations:\n        *   **C6 → New C2**: The configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n        *   **C1 → New C1**: The configuration is retained as (R).\n        *   **C4 → New C4**: The configuration is retained as (R).\n        *   **C3 → New C5**: The configuration is retained as (R).\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, the product should have the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nCombining the structure and the stereochemistry, the final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe calculated product matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
