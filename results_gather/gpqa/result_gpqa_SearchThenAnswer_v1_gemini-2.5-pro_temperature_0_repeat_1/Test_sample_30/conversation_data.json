    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the molecular symmetry of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is **p-nitrotoluene**.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This set of reagents is used for oxidation. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ typically convert the methyl group of nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), the conditions for the subsequent reaction suggest that an aldehyde is needed. The oxidation of a methyl group on an aromatic ring to an aldehyde can be achieved, although it can be challenging to prevent over-oxidation. For the purpose of this multi-step synthesis problem, it is logical to assume that the reaction conditions are controlled to yield the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because an aromatic aldehyde is reacting with a ketone.\n\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  The resulting aldol addition product quickly undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nThe final product is **4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one**. The double bond formed is predominantly in the more stable E (trans) configuration.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one, we need to analyze its structure for symmetry elements.\n\nThe structure is: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\nLet's examine the symmetry elements present in this molecule:\n\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n*   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** The molecule does not possess any C₂ or higher-order rotation axes. Rotating the molecule 180° around any axis will not result in an identical configuration.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule is essentially planar. The benzene ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group can all lie in the same plane. The nitro group can also rotate to be coplanar. The methyl group has hydrogens that will be positioned symmetrically with respect to this plane. Therefore, the molecule has a single plane of symmetry (σ) that contains all the heavy atoms (C, O, N). This is a horizontal reflection plane, designated σh if a principal axis existed, but here it is simply σ.\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** The molecule does not possess an improper rotation axis.\n\nA molecule that has only an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C₂H\nB) Cₛ\nC) D₂H\nD) C₃\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
