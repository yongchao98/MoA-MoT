    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this step, a bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on one of the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\n\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available α'-hydrogen is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and subsequent ring opening to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid salt. Acidification (during workup, which is implicit) gives the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n\nThionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is added as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Now, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. We look for protons in different chemical environments, considering the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton attached to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Methine Proton:** The single proton on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **Ring Protons (C2 and C5):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and the aldehyde group. This makes the two CH₂ groups at positions C2 and C5 equivalent. However, within each of these CH₂ groups, the two protons are diastereotopic (not chemically equivalent) due to the chirality of C1 and the non-planar nature of the ring. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **Ring Protons (C3 and C4):** Similarly, the CH₂ groups at positions C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. The two protons within each of these groups are also diastereotopic. These four protons give rise to another two distinct signals, which are different from the protons at C2/C5 because of their different proximity to the aldehyde group. (2 types)\n\nCounting the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5 protons) + 2 (C3/C4 protons) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
