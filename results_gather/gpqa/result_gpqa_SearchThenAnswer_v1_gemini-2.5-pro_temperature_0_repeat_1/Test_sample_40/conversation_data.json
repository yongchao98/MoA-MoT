    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity-addition formula. This formula is necessary because the simple addition of velocities is not valid in special relativity, a theory confirmed by experiments like the one conducted by Fizeau, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Define the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S'), is `u'`. This is determined by the index of refraction, `n`. The formula is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab (S) is `u`, which is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Set the speed of light in a vacuum:**\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, should be taken as 1.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula:**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities in the same direction is: `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values into this formula:\n        *   `u' = 1/n`\n        *   `v = v`\n        *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
