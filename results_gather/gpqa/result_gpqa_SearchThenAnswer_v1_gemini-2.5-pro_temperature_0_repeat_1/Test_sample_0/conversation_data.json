    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"broadening,\" of each level. This energy uncertainty is a fundamental consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nAccording to the energy-time uncertainty principle, a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship can be approximated by the formula:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁹ s:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁸ s:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the most significant energy broadening. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), which is the dominant factor. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than this value.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nComparing these options to the required minimum separation of approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV, only 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger. The other options are all smaller than the calculated energy uncertainty of the first state, meaning the energy levels would overlap and be indistinguishable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
