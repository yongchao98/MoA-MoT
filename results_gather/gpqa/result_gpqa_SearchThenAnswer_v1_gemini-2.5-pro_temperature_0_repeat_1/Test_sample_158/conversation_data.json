    "The observation of a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a distant quasar. The flux drop is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, which is the absorption of light by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds at lower redshifts.\n\nTo determine the comoving distance, we first need to calculate the redshift (z) of the quasar. The redshift is the fractional change in wavelength of light due to the expansion of the universe. The formula for redshift is:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nHere, the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is 790 nm. The rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.567 nm.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the redshift:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.567 nm) - 1 ≈ 5.498\n\nWith the redshift and the given cosmological parameters (Hubble constant H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3, and dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7 for a flat universe), the comoving distance can be calculated. This calculation is typically done by integrating the Friedmann equation, and for this purpose, standard cosmological calculators are used.\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with the following inputs:\n*   Redshift (z) ≈ 5.5\n*   Hubble Constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter Density (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark Energy Density (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n\nThe resulting comoving distance is approximately 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
