    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of O) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.845 + 3*(16.00) + 3*(1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\n**2. Stoichiometry of the Dissolution Reaction:**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds according to the following reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to react with every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\nMoles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**3. Determine the Final pH using the Solubility Product (Ksp):**\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the ion product of its dissolved ions must be less than or equal to its solubility product constant, Ksp. The equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nThe Ksp expression is Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.\nThe concentration of Fe³⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n[Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\nThe Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹.\nNow, we can calculate the maximum hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] that can be present before Fe(OH)₃ precipitates:\n1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n[OH⁻]³ = (1.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 1.710 x 10⁻³⁷ M³\n[OH⁻] = (1.710 x 10⁻³⁷)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 5.55 x 10⁻¹³ M.\nNow we can find the pOH and then the pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(5.55 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.26\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.26 = 1.74.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Acid Needed:**\nThe total amount of strong acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacted with the Fe(OH)₃ and the excess acid required to maintain the final pH.\nFirst, find the concentration of H⁺ at the final pH:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻¹·⁷⁴ ≈ 1.82 x 10⁻² M.\nNext, calculate the moles of excess H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution:\nMoles of excess H⁺ = [H⁺]final * Volume = (1.82 x 10⁻² mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 1.82 x 10⁻³ moles.\nNow, find the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:\nTotal moles H⁺ = (moles of H⁺ reacted) + (moles of excess H⁺)\nTotal moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles) + (1.82 x 10⁻³ moles) = 4.627 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Acid:**\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed:\nVolume = Total moles H⁺ / Molarity = (4.627 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.04627 L.\nConverting this volume to cm³:\nVolume = 0.04627 L * 1000 cm³/L = 46.27 cm³.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on these calculations. None of the options match. There might be a different Ksp value used for the problem's intended answer. Let's re-calculate using the pH from option C (pH = 2.04) to see if the corresponding volume matches.\n\n**Re-calculation assuming pH = 2.04:**\nIf the final pH is 2.04, then:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M.\nMoles of excess H⁺ = (9.12 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\nTotal moles H⁺ = (moles of H⁺ reacted) + (moles of excess H⁺)\nTotal moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ moles.\nVolume of acid = (3.719 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\nThis does not match the volume in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\nLet's try working backward from the volume in option C (28.05 cm³).\nMoles of H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ moles.\nThis amount is almost exactly the amount needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles). This implies there is virtually no excess acid, which would result in a much higher pH.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options or the standard Ksp values. However, let's re-examine the initial calculation. The pH of 1.74 is closest to 2.04 among the choices. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.869 = 0.0009357 mol\nMoles H⁺ reacted = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 / 0.1 = 0.009357 M\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 from option C is correct and check the Ksp value that would result.\nIf pH = 2.04, pOH = 11.96.\n[OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M.\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357) * (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁴⁴. This is a plausible, though different, value for Ksp.\n\nNow let's calculate the volume of acid required for a pH of 2.04.\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ * 0.1 = 0.000912 mol.\nTotal moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\nVolume acid = 0.003719 / 0.1 = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option C (28.05 cm³). Let's re-calculate using the volume from option C and find the resulting pH.\nMoles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\nMoles H⁺ reacted = 0.002807 mol.\nThis is a slight deficit of H⁺, meaning not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the mass of Fe(OH)₃ and work backwards from option C.\nAssume pH = 2.04 and Volume = 28.05 cm³ are correct.\nTotal moles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\nMoles H⁺ reacted = Total moles - excess moles = 0.002805 - 0.000912 = 0.001893 mol.\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = Moles H⁺ reacted / 3 = 0.001893 / 3 = 0.000631 mol.\nMass Fe(OH)₃ = 0.000631 mol * 106.869 g/mol = 0.0674 g.\nIf the initial mass was 0.0674 g instead of 0.1 g, option C would be correct.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, let's reconsider the problem as stated. It's possible a different Ksp value is intended. A common literature value for Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ is around 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\nUsing Ksp = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹:\n[OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (0.009357) ≈ 2.98 x 10⁻³⁷\n[OH⁻] ≈ 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M\npOH = -log(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.18\npH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\nThis pH is still closest to 2.04. The associated volume would be:\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻¹·⁸² * 0.1 = 0.00151 mol\nTotal moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.00151 = 0.004317 mol\nVolume = 0.004317 / 0.1 = 0.04317 L = 43.17 cm³\n\nGiven the provided options, there is a high probability of an error in the question's data. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" fit, the calculated pH values (1.74-1.82) are in the same range as the pH in option C (2.04), while the other options are further away. The calculated volumes do not align with any option. Let's assume the intended answer is C, likely due to the use of specific, non-standard textbook values or a typo in the problem statement.\n\nFinal check of logic: The process of calculating moles of reactant, determining the required final pH for dissolution via Ksp, calculating the excess acid needed for that pH, and summing the reacted and excess acid to find the total volume is chemically sound. The discrepancy arises from the numerical values provided in the options not matching the results of these sound calculations with standard chemical data. Based on the closest pH value, C is the most plausible intended answer despite the volume mismatch.\n\n<<<C>>>"
