    "Analyzing the options provided:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is describing a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same rocky composition, density tends to increase with mass. This is because the greater gravitational force of a more massive planet compresses its material more tightly. A super-Earth with a mass of 5 Earth masses and an Earth-like composition will have a significantly higher central pressure and overall density than Earth. Therefore, its density will be greater than Earth's density of 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with a smaller mass than Earth but the same composition will experience less gravitational compression. This results in a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) will have a density greater than 5.51 g/cm³ due to increased gravitational compression from its higher mass.\n*   Planet (d) will have a density lower than 5.51 g/cm³ due to less gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass will have the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
