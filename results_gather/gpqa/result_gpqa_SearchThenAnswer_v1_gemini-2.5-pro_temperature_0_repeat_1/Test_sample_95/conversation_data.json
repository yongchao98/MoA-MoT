    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, a step-by-step calculation is performed using fundamental physics principles and constants.\n\nFirst, the physical size of the event horizon (its radius) is determined from its angular size and distance. The distance to the galaxy is given as d = 10¹⁰ parsecs. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters, so the distance in meters is about 3.086 x 10²⁶ m. The angular size is given as θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees. To be used in calculations, this angle must be converted to radians by multiplying by π/180, which gives approximately 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians. For small angles, the radius of the event horizon (which is the Schwarzschild radius, r_s) can be approximated by the formula r_s ≈ d * θ.\n\nUsing the values:\nr_s ≈ (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m.\n\nNext, the area of the event horizon (A) is calculated using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, A = 4πr_s².\nA = 4π * (5.385 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 3.643 x 10¹⁶ m².\n\nFinally, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S) of the black hole is calculated. The formula for the entropy is S = (A * k_B) / (4 * l_p²), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and l_p is the Planck length. The Planck length is a fundamental constant derived from the gravitational constant (G), the reduced Planck constant (ħ), and the speed of light (c), with its square being l_p² = (Għ)/c³.\n\nThe values of the physical constants are:\n*   Boltzmann constant (k_B) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   Gravitational constant (G) ≈ 6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ N(m/kg)²\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\nFirst, the square of the Planck length is calculated:\nl_p² = (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ * 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) / (3 x 10⁸)³ ≈ 2.605 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m².\n\nNow, the entropy can be calculated:\nS = (3.643 x 10¹⁶ m² * 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) / (4 * 2.605 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²) ≈ 4.82 x 10⁶² J/K.\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 4.82 x 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is therefore 10⁶², which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
