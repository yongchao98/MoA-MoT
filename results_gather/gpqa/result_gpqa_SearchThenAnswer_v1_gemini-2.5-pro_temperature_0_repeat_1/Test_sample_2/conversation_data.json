    "The expectation value of an operator is the average result of a measurement of that observable. It is calculated by operating on the state of the system with the corresponding operator, and then projecting that back onto the original state. For a linear combination of operators, the expectation value is the linear combination of the individual expectation values.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nHere, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the Pauli matrix σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. The operator in question is 10σz + 5σx.\n\nThe expectation value ⟨O⟩ of an operator O is given by ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. For the given operator, this can be written as:\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of σz:\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩\nSince |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz:\nσz|ψ⟩ = 0.5(σz|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σz|↓⟩) = 0.5(+1)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2(-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩\nThen, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\nUsing the orthonormality of the states (⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0), we get:\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σx. The σx operator acts on the basis states as follows: σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\nσx|ψ⟩ = 0.5(σx|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σx|↓⟩) = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩\nThen, ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866\n\nFinally, we combine these results to find the total expectation value:\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)\n= -5 + 2.5 * √3\n≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n≈ -5 + 4.33\n≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
