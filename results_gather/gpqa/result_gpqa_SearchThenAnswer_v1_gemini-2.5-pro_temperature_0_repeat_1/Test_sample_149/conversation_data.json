    "The final answer is based on a three-step chemical transformation.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material:**\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degrees of unsaturation are calculated to be 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional degree of unsaturation (like a C=O bond).\n\nThe 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 (t, 1H):** An aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a neighboring CH2 group.\n*   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nCombining these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for diazotization. A primary aromatic amine reacts to form a diazonium salt. Thus, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to the corresponding diazonium salt, 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, especially with gentle heating, results in the replacement of the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves an aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-hydrogens (on the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde group). In the presence of a base (KOH), one molecule forms an enolate which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This is a self-condensation reaction. The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product:**\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, results in the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. This yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nComparing this structure to the given options:\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the intermediate before dehydration.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal is structurally incorrect.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal matches the expected final product.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal is incorrect as the hydroxyl groups are missing.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
