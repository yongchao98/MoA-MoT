    "To solve this problem, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (Δt₀), which is given as 50 seconds.\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is the stationary frame of reference from which we are observing the ejecta.\n\n### 2. Given Information\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is 50 s.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 3. Time Dilation\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for an event occurring in a moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere:\n*   Δt is the time interval measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   Δt₀ is the proper time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light (β):\nβ = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √0.96\n\n### 5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)\nNow we can calculate the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\nΔt = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\nΔt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s\nΔt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\nΔt ≈ 51.03 s\n\nSo, while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds have passed in the Galaxy's frame of reference.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame\nFinally, to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame, we use the standard distance formula with the time calculated for the Galaxy's frame:\n\nDistance = velocity × time\nd = v * Δt\nd = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )\nd = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the value in option D.\n\n*   **Option A) 2,880,000 km:** Incorrect.\n*   **Option B) 3,000,000 km:** This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored (60,000 km/s * 50 s).\n*   **Option C) 2,940,000 km:** This value is close to what one might get by incorrectly applying length contraction to the distance.\n*   **Option D) 3,060,000 km:** This is the correct answer, accounting for the time dilation effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
