    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we can use the provided stability constants and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all the formed complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, in this case [Co(SCN)₂], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The percentage is this fraction multiplied by 100.\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the complex concentrations, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out, simplifying the calculation. The formula for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:\n\nPercentage = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) * 100\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can now perform the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate each term in the denominator:**\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n2.  **Sum the terms to find the denominator:**\n    *   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n3.  **The numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:**\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\n4.  **Calculate the final percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis result is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
