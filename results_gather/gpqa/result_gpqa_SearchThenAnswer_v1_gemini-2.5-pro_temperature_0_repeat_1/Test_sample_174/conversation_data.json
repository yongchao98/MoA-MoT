    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid that is small compared to the radiated wavelength, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The characteristics of the radiation from such a dipole are well-established in electromagnetism.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The relationship is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated in the direction where `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (the equatorial plane). Therefore, the maximum radiated power `A` is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we evaluate `sin²(30°)`:\n\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe power radiated at 30° is therefore `A/4`. The fraction of the maximum power is 1/4.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency (`ω`) of oscillation, and consequently on the wavelength (`λ`), since `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. According to the Larmor formula and its extensions to oscillating dipoles, the total radiated power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\nThis means the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`. The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, will have the same dependence on the wavelength.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The functional form of the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
