    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for preparing 1,2-diketones. The reagents first form nitrous acid (HONO), which then generates the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO+). This ion reacts with the enol form of the ketone at the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). The initial product, an α-nitroso ketone, tautomerizes to a more stable oxime, which is then hydrolyzed in the aqueous solution to yield the final 1,2-diketone product.\n\nBased on this mechanism, the starting materials for the given reactions must be ketones.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is a 1,2-dione formed on a cyclohexane ring. For this product to form, the reaction must start with a ketone where one of the carbonyl groups is already present. The reaction then introduces the second carbonyl group on an adjacent carbon. Therefore, the starting material A must be **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** The product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is a linear 1,2-dione. Following the same logic as Reaction A, the starting material must be a ketone that allows for the formation of a second carbonyl group at an adjacent position. If we start with **5-methylhexan-2-one**, the reaction will occur at the α-carbon at position 3, leading to the formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Starting material A is correct, but B is a diol. Diols do not undergo this reaction to form diketones.\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Both starting materials are ketones and are the correct precursors for the respective products as explained above.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Starting material A is an alcohol, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Both starting materials are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair of starting materials is provided in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
