    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch from an ester group**. The frequency is generally too high for an amide and fits perfectly for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   Taken together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadropole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the signature pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n### 4. Structure Assembly and Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and is consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide (contradicts IR C=O stretch) and is 1,3-disubstituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
