    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis determines the optical activity for each of the seven compounds listed.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and no chiral centers. The molecule itself is achiral as the plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify the three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The presence of these descriptors for a specific, complex molecule indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, and the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry. This specific stereoisomer is a meso compound, which is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S, 3S isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name explicitly indicates the (R) configuration at a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. As a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (*cis*). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An examination of the structure reveals that there are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<C>>>"
