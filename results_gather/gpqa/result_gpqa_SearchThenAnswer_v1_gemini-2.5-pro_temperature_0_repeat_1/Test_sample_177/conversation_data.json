    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the given Lagrangian term:\n\n\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of κ\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S = ∫d⁴x L is dimensionless. Since d⁴x has a mass dimension of -4, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of +4. Therefore, every term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nLet's determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term:\n*   **Fermion fields (ψ and ψ̄):** In 4-dimensional spacetime, a fermion field has a mass dimension of 3/2. Thus, the term ψ̄ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** This tensor is derived from the kinetic term of the electromagnetic field, -(1/4)F<sub>μν</sub>F<sup>μν</sup>. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, F<sup>μν</sup> must have a mass dimension of 2.\n*   **Sigma tensor (σ<sub>μν</sub>):** The term σ<sub>μν</sub> is defined as (i/2)[γ<sub>μ</sub>,γ<sub>ν</sub>], where γ<sub>μ</sub> are the Dirac gamma matrices. These matrices are dimensionless. Therefore, σ<sub>μν</sub> is also dimensionless.\n\nNow, we can find the mass dimension of κ by ensuring the total mass dimension of L<sub>int</sub> is 4:\n[L<sub>int</sub>] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ<sub>μν</sub>] + [F<sup>μν</sup>] = 4\n4 = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2\n4 = [κ] + 3 + 2\n4 = [κ] + 5\n[κ] = -1\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero, the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if the dimension is strictly positive).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. Theories with negative mass dimension couplings require an infinite number of counterterms to cancel divergences at all orders of perturbation theory, which makes them lose their predictive power at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
