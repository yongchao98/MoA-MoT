    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene), this syn-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the alkene with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an **anti-addition**. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso compound**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The **syn-addition** of the oxygen atom to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) results in a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry, the resulting *cis*-epoxide is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The **anti-addition** of water to this meso epoxide can occur by attack at either of the two epoxide carbons.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the attack at either carbon is equally likely, producing a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are an equal mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a standard column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks will be observed.** (Peak 1: meso-diol; Peak 2: racemic pair).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   This differential interaction allows for the separation of enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will be separated.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks will be observed.** (One for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture).\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
