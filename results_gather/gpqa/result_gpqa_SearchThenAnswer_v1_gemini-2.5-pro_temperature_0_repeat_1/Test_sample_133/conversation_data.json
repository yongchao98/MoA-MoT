    "To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we must first determine the number of moles of acid (H⁺) and base (OH⁻) that react.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of H⁺ ions:**\n*   From HCl: 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol H⁺\n*   From H₂SO₄: 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H₂SO₄. Since H₂SO₄ is a diprotic strong acid, it provides 2 moles of H⁺ per mole of H₂SO₄.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 mol H⁺\n*   **Total moles of H⁺** = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = **0.28 mol**\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of OH⁻ ions:**\n*   From Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol Ba(OH)₂. Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides 2 moles of OH⁻ per mole.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 0.10 mol × 2 = **0.20 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant for neutralization:**\nThe neutralization reaction is H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l).\nWe have 0.28 mol of H⁺ and 0.20 mol of OH⁻. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is the limiting reactant, meaning only 0.20 mol of OH⁻ will react with 0.20 mol of H⁺ to form 0.20 mol of water.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization:**\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.6 kcal/mol (or -57.1 kJ/mol). This value represents the heat released per mole of water formed.\n*   Enthalpy change = moles of water formed × enthalpy of neutralization per mole\n*   Enthalpy change = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   **Enthalpy change = -2.72 kcal**\n\nNote that a precipitation reaction also occurs between barium ions (Ba²⁺) from Ba(OH)₂ and sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from H₂SO₄. However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" which refers to the heat evolved from the acid-base reaction forming water. The calculated value of -2.72 kcal matches one of the options exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
