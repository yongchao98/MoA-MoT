    "Due to the principles of electrostatic induction, the positive charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity induces a negative charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity. Since the spherical conductor is initially uncharged, a positive charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\nA key concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conducting material isolates the exterior region from the interior. The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. As a consequence, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity.\n\nBecause the outer surface is a sphere, the induced charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over this surface. For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P, which is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor, is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law, treating the charge on the outer surface as a point charge located at the center of the conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's position ($s$), the point P's distance from the cavity ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ is extraneous for calculating the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
