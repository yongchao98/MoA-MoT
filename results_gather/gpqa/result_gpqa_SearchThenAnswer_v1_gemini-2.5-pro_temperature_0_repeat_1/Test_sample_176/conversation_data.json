    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which describes the power radiated from a black body. The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to that of Star_2 (L2):\n\nL1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nBy simplifying this equation, we get:\n\nL1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), which means the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength of peak emission (λ_max) for a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The law is expressed as λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Since the peak emission wavelengths for both stars are the same (λ_max₁ = λ_max₂), their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures T₁/T₂ is 1.\n\nThe additional details, such as the masses and radial velocities of the stars, are not needed for this specific calculation.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\nL1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>"
