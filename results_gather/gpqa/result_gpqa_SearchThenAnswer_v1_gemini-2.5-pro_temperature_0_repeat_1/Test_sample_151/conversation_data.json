    "When a yeast cell, such as *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, responds to a mating pheromone, it undergoes a series of specific cellular changes. This response includes arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, initiating a new program of gene expression, and forming a polarized projection called a shmoo toward the potential mating partner. The experiment aims to identify proteins on *active chromatin* during this process.\n\nLet's analyze the likelihood of finding each complex:\n\n*   **A) Nucleosome histone complex:** Histones are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. Any experiment that immunoprecipitates chromatin will recover a large amount of the nucleosome histone complex, as it is the basic unit of DNA packaging.\n*   **B) Enhancer protein complex:** The formation of a shmoo is driven by significant changes in the expression of hundreds of genes specific to the mating process. This transcriptional activation requires activator proteins to bind to enhancer regions of the DNA. These enhancer-protein complexes are a key feature of active chromatin and would be expected to be abundant.\n*   **C) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, which includes RNA polymerase II, assembles at the promoters of genes that are being actively transcribed. Since the shmoo state involves extensive gene transcription to prepare for mating, PICs will be present on the active chromatin of these genes.\n*   **D) Pre-replication complex (PRC):** The PRC assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to license the DNA for a round of replication in the upcoming S phase. However, a critical feature of the pheromone response is the arrest of the cell cycle in G1, which specifically *prevents* the cell from entering S phase and replicating its DNA. The cell's resources are directed towards mating, not cell division. Therefore, while the cell is in G1, the formation of new pre-replication complexes is inhibited, and this complex is not associated with the active transcriptional processes that define the shmoo state.\n\nGiven that the cell is arrested in G1 and focused on transcription for mating rather than preparing for DNA replication, the pre-replication complex would be the least abundant complex recovered from the active chromatin.\n\n<<<D>>>"
