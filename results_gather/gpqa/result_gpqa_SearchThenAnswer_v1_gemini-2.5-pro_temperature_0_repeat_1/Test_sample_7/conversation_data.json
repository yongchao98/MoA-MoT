  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes\nFirst, we examine the effect of knocking out each gene individually to understand its importance for anthracnose resistance. The wild-type (control) has 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This is a partial loss of resistance, suggesting G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype, but its role is not as critical as the others.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of resistance, indicating that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This represents a significant loss of resistance, suggesting G3 plays a more substantial role than G1 but is less critical than G2.\n\n### 2. Identify the Upstream Transcription Factor\nThe problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor that acts upstream of other genes. A transcription factor is a protein that regulates the expression of other genes.\n\n*   The `g2` mutant's phenotype (0% resistance) is the most severe. A knockout of a key upstream transcription factor that activates the entire resistance pathway would be expected to cause a complete loss of function, as seen with `g2`.\n*   If G1 were the transcription factor, its knockout would likely result in a phenotype at least as severe as the genes it regulates (G2 or G3), which is not the case (75% resistance for `g1` vs. 0% and 50% for `g2` and `g3`).\n*   Therefore, **G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor** that regulates G1 and/or G3.\n\n### 3. Analyze Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by another. We look at the phenotype of the double mutants compared to the single mutants.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n*   The fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 further supports the conclusion that G2 is an upstream regulator in the pathway. If G2 is the transcription factor for G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 prevents their production, making the status of the G1 and G3 genes irrelevant.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either the `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%) single mutants.\n*   This is a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of the two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects. The expected resistance, if they acted independently, might be calculated as 75% * 50% = 37.5%. The actual result of 10% shows a much stronger negative effect.\n*   This synergistic relationship suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same biological function (resistance) through partially overlapping or parallel pathways. The term **gene redundancy** is used to describe situations where multiple genes perform the same or similar functions, and the loss of both genes has a much stronger effect than the loss of just one. This is a fitting description for the relationship between G1 and G3.\n*   \"Pleiotropy\" refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits and does not accurately describe the interaction between two genes for a single trait.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G1 is unlikely to be the transcription factor.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G3 is not epistatic to G1; their interaction is synergistic.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect because G1 is not epistatic to G3, and \"pleiotropy\" is not the best description of their interaction.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is strongly supported by the data.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is the best available description for their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is incorrect based on the data (`g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%).\n\nDespite the final clause being incorrect, Option D contains the two most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment: G2 is the transcription factor, and the relationship between G1 and G3 is best described as gene redundancy. Among the given choices, it represents the best possible conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
