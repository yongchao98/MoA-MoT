    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the Initial State\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. The normalized state vector is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n### Step 2: Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue p = 0. This means solving the equation P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩, where |v⟩ is the eigenvector `[[x], [y], [z]]`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  y/√2 = 0  => y = 0\n2.  x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\nIf we let z = 1, then x = -1. The unnormalized eigenvector for p=0 is `[[-1], [0], [1]]`.\n\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\nNorm = √((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = √2\nThe normalized eigenvector |p=0⟩ is:\n|p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector of the system.\n\nP(p=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] * [(1/√6) * `[[-1],,]`]\n⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * [(-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1]\n⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3\n\nThe probability is:\nP(p=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3\n\n### Step 4: Determine the State After Measuring P = 0\n\nWhen a measurement is made, the system's state collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. In this case, after measuring p=0, the new state of the system |ψ'⟩ is the normalized eigenvector |p=0⟩.\n\n|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n### Step 5: Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue q = -1 is:\n|q=-1⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of measuring q = -1 from the new state |ψ'⟩. This is a conditional probability.\n\nP(q=-1 | p=0) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = * [(1/√2) * `[[-1],,]`]\n⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * [0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1]\n⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = 1/√2\n\nThe probability is:\nP(q=-1 | p=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Total Probability\n\nThe total probability of measuring p=0 and then q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the previous steps.\n\nP(total) = P(p=0) * P(q=-1 | p=0)\nP(total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\n<<<B>>>"
