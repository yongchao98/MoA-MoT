    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable P will yield the value 0, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the observable P.**\n\nThe observable is given by the matrix:\nP =  (0, 1/√2, 0)\n    (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)\n    (0, 1/√2, 0)\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0:\ndet [(-λ, 1/√2, 0), (1/√2, -λ, 1/√2), (0, 1/√2, -λ)] = 0\n-λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\nThis gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\n**2. Find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector |v₀⟩ such that P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0. Let the eigenvector be (x, y, z).\n[(0, 1/√2, 0), (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), (0, 1/√2, 0)] * [x, y, z]ᵀ =ᵀ\n\nThis results in the following system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x = -z\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form (x, 0, -x). To normalize it, the sum of the squares of its components must be 1:\nx² + 0² + (-x)² = 1\n2x² = 1\nx² = 1/2\nx = 1/√2\n\nChoosing x = 1/√2, the normalized eigenvector |E₀⟩ for the eigenvalue 0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\n**3. Normalize the state vector of the system.**\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1).\nFirst, we find the norm squared of this vector:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nThe normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)\n\n**4. Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\nProbability(λ=0) = |⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product ⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩:\n⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) · [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)]\n⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [(1/√2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/√2)(1)]\n⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2]\n⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-2/√2]\n⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-√2]\n⟨E₀|ψ_norm⟩ = -√2/√6 = -√(1/3) = -1/√3\n\nNow, square the absolute value of this result to find the probability:\nProbability(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
