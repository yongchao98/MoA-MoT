    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance.\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to a star. This fundamental relationship is expressed as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n2.  **Define the given information.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This is interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which can be written in differential form as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, changes with distance `r`.\n\n4.  **Relate the two differential quantities.**\n    We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance to the rate of change with respect to parallax:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    From the relationship `plx = 1/r`, we can differentiate parallax with respect to distance:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (1/r) = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships.**\n    Now, substitute the given proportionality and the derivative back into the chain rule equation. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can ignore the constant factors and the negative sign.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express the relationship entirely in terms of distance (r).**\n    To get the final relationship, replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance) as r³.\n\n<<<A>>>"
