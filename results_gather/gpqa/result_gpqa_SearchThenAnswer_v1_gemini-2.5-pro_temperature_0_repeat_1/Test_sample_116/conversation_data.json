    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not possess a chiral center. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule as a whole is achiral because it can easily interconvert between mirror-image conformations and possesses planes of symmetry in some conformations. It does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and cannot be optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
