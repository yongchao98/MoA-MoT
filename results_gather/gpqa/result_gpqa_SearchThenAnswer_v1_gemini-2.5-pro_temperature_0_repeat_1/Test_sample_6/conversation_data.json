    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for electron-positron pair production ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$).\n\nThis process is governed by the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum. The annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray with a low-energy CMB photon produces an electron-positron pair. For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron and positron.\n\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$) in a head-on collision with a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) can be calculated using the following formula, derived from the invariance of the four-momentum squared:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\geq \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n\nFrom experimental data, the rest mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/cÂ². Therefore, the rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nGiven that the average photon energy of the CMB is $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare this with the given options, we convert the energy to Giga-electronvolts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n\nThe calculated threshold energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
