    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring (cyclohexene) with one double bond.\n    *   **Functional Groups:**\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n        *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n        *   A carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring (at position 3).\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:**\n    *   The core ring is cyclohexene. Let's count the carbons and hydrogens:\n        *   Carbons: 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n        *   Hydrogens: Let's draw the structure to count accurately.\n            *   C1: -CH(COOH)-\n            *   C2: -CH(CHO)-\n            *   C3: =CH-\n            *   C4: =CH-\n            *   C5: -CH(CH=CH₂)-\n            *   C6: -CH₂-\n            *   Ring hydrogens: 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7\n            *   Carboxyl hydrogen: 1\n            *   Formyl hydrogen: 1\n            *   Vinyl hydrogens: 3\n            *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens (H₁₂).\n        *   Oxygens: 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = 3 oxygens (O₃).\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\n    *   The formula for IHD is: IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1.\n    *   IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    *   This can be verified from the structure: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) = 5.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction and the Reagent's Function:**\n    *   The reagent is red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds completely to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n    *   Specifically:\n        *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n        *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n        *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n5.  **Determine the Product:**\n    *   The reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting material.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The carbon skeleton of the molecule remains unchanged, meaning the product will still have 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane: 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact IUPAC name depends on numbering, but the structure is a cyclohexane ring with one ethyl and two methyl substituents).\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane).\n    *   The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since the number of carbon atoms is 10, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\n    *   Using the molecular formula of the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n    *   Alternatively, by inspecting the structure of the product (a substituted cyclohexane), we can see it contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. The presence of a single ring corresponds to an IHD of 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
