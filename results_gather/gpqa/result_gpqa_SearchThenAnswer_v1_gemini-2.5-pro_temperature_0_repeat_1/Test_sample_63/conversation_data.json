    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure - STP) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This inert gas, in the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the initial salts based on the products:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based acids. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures (the problem states 200°C), one of its decomposition pathways produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis set of reactions produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O, matching the experimental results.\n\n**3. Use stoichiometry to verify the salt identities:**\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contained `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ (from the 2:2 ratio), `0.5x` moles of O₂ (from the 2:1 ratio), and `2x` moles of H₂O (from the 2:4 ratio).\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\n**Now, let's use the moles calculated from the experimental data:**\n*   From O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of `x` = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming that the mixture was 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol = 4.0025 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<A>>>"
