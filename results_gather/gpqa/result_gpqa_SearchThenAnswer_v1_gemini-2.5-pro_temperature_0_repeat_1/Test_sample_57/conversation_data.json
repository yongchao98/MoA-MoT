    "Of the options provided, the one physical theory that is believed not to require regularization at high energies is Superstring Theory.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This theory, which describes how light and matter interact, requires a process called regularization, followed by renormalization, to handle infinite quantities that arise in calculations of high-energy processes. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, appear in calculations involving loop diagrams.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This classical theory also encounters infinities, most notably in the calculation of the self-energy of a point-like charged particle. The energy of the electric field of a point charge is infinite, which implies an infinite mass. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at very small distance scales, which corresponds to high energies, and requires some form of regularization or an admission that the theory is incomplete at that scale.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD is a quantum field theory similar in structure to QED. It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations, which must be treated with regularization and renormalization.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is its ability to resolve the problem of ultraviolet divergences that plague quantum field theories, especially in the context of gravity. It is widely believed to be free from such high-energy divergences. This is because it replaces point-like particles with one-dimensional strings, which \"smears out\" the interactions at very short distances, thus avoiding the infinities that would otherwise appear. Therefore, it does not require high-energy regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
