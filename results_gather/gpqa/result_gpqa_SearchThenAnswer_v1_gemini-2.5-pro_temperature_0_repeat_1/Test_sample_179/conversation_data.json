    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of a central charge and 12 charges on the surface of a sphere. The total energy is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nFor the total energy to be at a minimum, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n**1. Potential Energy between the Central Charge and the Sphere Charges (U_cs)**\n\nEach of the 12 charges (q_s = 2e) on the sphere is at a distance R = 2 m from the central charge (q_c = 2e). The potential energy for one such pair is given by the formula U = k * (q_c * q_s) / R.\n\n*   Charge (q) = 2 * e = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   Distance (R) = 2 m\n*   Coulomb's constant (k) ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²\n\nThe energy for one pair is:\nU_pair = k * (2e * 2e) / R = 4 * k * e² / R\n\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere, the total energy for this component is:\nU_cs = 12 * (4 * k * e² / R) = 48 * k * e² / R\n\n**2. Potential Energy among the 12 Charges on the Sphere (U_s)**\n\nThe potential energy of the 12 charges arranged in an icosahedron is given by:\nU_s = (k * q_s²) / R * E₁₂ = (k * (2e)²) / R * E₁₂ = 4 * k * e² / R * E₁₂\n\nHere, E₁₂ is the dimensionless energy for the N=12 Thomson problem, which represents the sum of the inverse distances between all pairs of vertices on a unit sphere. The value for an icosahedral configuration is E₁₂ ≈ 49.165.\n\nSo, the energy of the charges on the sphere is:\nU_s = 4 * 49.165 * k * e² / R = 196.66 * k * e² / R\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy (U_total)**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two energy components:\nU_total = U_cs + U_s\nU_total = (48 * k * e² / R) + (196.66 * k * e² / R)\nU_total = (48 + 196.66) * k * e² / R\nU_total = 244.66 * k * e² / R\n\nNow, we substitute the values of the constants:\nU_total = 244.66 * (8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²) * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)² / 2 m\nU_total = 122.33 * (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (2.56697 × 10⁻³⁸) J\nU_total ≈ 2.8224 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy of the system is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
