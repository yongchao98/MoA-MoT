    "For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. The energy eigenvalues for this system are determined by the principal quantum number $n$, which can take non-negative integer values ($n=0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\nThe energy of a given state is calculated using the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe different energy states are:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n    $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n    $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n    $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, for a state with principal quantum number $n$ is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nTo find the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state, we set $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, for the third excited state, there are 10 possible linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nBased on these calculations, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and the degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
