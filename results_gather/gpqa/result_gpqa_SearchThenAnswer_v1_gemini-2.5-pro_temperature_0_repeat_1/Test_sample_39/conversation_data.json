    "When a chemist laments that their \"compounds are on top of each other,\" they are most likely referring to a common problem encountered during the purification of chemical mixtures. This issue is directly related to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\nIn synthetic organic chemistry, techniques like Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography are routinely used to separate different compounds from a reaction mixture. These methods work by exploiting differences in the polarity of the molecules.\n\nThe separation process involves a stationary phase (often silica gel, which is polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent or solvent mixture). As the mobile phase moves through the stationary phase, it carries the compounds with it. Molecules that are more polar will have a stronger attraction to the polar stationary phase and will move more slowly. Conversely, less polar compounds will be more attracted to the mobile phase and will travel faster.\n\nWhen compounds in a mixture have very similar polarities, they interact with the stationary and mobile phases in a nearly identical manner. This causes them to travel at almost the same rate, resulting in poor separation. On a TLC plate, this manifests as spots that are very close together or even overlapping, appearing as if they are \"on top of each other.\" In column chromatography, this means the compounds will exit the column at the same time, making it impossible to isolate them into separate fractions.\n\nWhile other properties can be similar between compounds, they are not the primary reason for this specific phrasing:\n*   **Optical rotation** is a property of chiral molecules and does not affect their separation in standard chromatography unless a special chiral stationary phase is used.\n*   **Non-covalent interactions** are the basis of the separation in chromatography, but the issue is the similarity of these interactions due to similar polarity, not just their existence.\n*   **Boiling points** are relevant for separation by distillation, not chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the chemist's statement is a colloquial way of saying that the separation of their compounds by chromatography has failed because their polarities are too alike.\n\n<<<A>>>"
