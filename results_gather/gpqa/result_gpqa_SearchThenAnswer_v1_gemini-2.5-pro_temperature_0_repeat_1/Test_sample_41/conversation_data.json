    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow a two-step process that involves the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and then Kepler's Third Law. The information regarding the masses of the planets and the method of their discovery (TTV) is not necessary for this calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. This is dependent on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star (d), and its albedo (A), which is the fraction of light it reflects. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1-A)/d² )^(1/4).\n\nGiven that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets and they orbit the same star, the equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to 1/√d. This leads to the following relationship for any two planets in the system:\n\n(T₁ / T₂) = √(d₂ / d₁)\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T₁ / T₂ ≈ 1.4\n*   T₂ / T₃ ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing these ratios, we can find the ratios of their orbital distances:\n*   d₂ / d₁ = (T₁ / T₂)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n*   d₃ / d₂ = (T₂ / T₃)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (d₃ / d₁), we multiply the individual ratios:\n\nd₃ / d₁ = (d₃ / d₂) * (d₂ / d₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n**Step 2: Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the same as the orbital distance (d). Therefore, P² ∝ d³.\n\nThis can be expressed as a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star:\n\n(P₃ / P₁)² = (d₃ / d₁)²\nP₃ / P₁ = (d₃ / d₁)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can substitute the calculated ratio of the orbital distances:\n\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.43\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
