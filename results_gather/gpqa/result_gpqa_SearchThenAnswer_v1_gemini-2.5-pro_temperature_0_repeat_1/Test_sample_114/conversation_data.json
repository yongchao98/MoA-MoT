    "The problem describes the collision and subsequent annihilation of an electron and a positron, resulting in the creation of two photons. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n### Initial State:\n\n*   An electron moves from the left with a Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n*   A positron moves from the right with a Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n*   Both particles have the same rest mass, denoted as m_e.\n\n### Final State:\n\n*   Two photons are produced.\n*   They have identical energies (E_γ).\n*   They move away at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n### Applying Conservation Laws:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_i) = E_electron + E_positron = γ_e*m_e*c² + γ_p*m_e*c²\n    *   Final Energy (E_f) = E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2 * E_γ\n    *   Equating them: (γ_e + γ_p) * m_e*c² = 2 * E_γ\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after. Momentum is a vector quantity, so we consider its components.\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (P_i):**\n        *   The electron moves in the positive x-direction: p_e = √(γ_e² - 1) * m_e*c\n        *   The positron moves in the negative x-direction: p_p = -√(γ_p² - 1) * m_e*c\n        *   Total initial momentum in the x-direction (P_ix) = (√(γ_e² - 1) - √(γ_p² - 1)) * m_e*c\n        *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n    *   **Final Momentum (P_f):**\n        *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ / c.\n        *   The x-component of momentum for each photon is (E_γ / c) * cos(θ).\n        *   Total final momentum in the x-direction (P_fx) = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ).\n        *   The y-components of the photons' momenta are equal and opposite, so the total final momentum in the y-direction is zero, which is consistent with the initial state.\n\n### Solving for the Angle:\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n(√(γ_e² - 1) - √(γ_p² - 1)) * m_e*c = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the photon energy as:\nE_γ = (γ_e + γ_p) * m_e*c² / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for E_γ into the momentum equation:\n(√(γ_e² - 1) - √(γ_p² - 1)) * m_e*c = 2 * [((γ_e + γ_p) * m_e*c² / 2) / c] * cos(θ)\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling terms (m_e*c) on both sides gives:\n√(γ_e² - 1) - √(γ_p² - 1) = (γ_e + γ_p) * cos(θ)\n\nWe can now solve for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (√(γ_e² - 1) - √(γ_p² - 1)) / (γ_e + γ_p)\n\nPlugging in the given Lorentz factors (γ_e = 4 and γ_p = 2):\ncos(θ) = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1)) / (4 + 2)\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nCalculating the numerical values:\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nNow, we find the angle θ:\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nTotal Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
