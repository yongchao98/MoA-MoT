    "The observations presented are classic indicators of the presence of diastereomers. Here is a detailed breakdown of why this is the most plausible explanation:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since these protons are in different chemical environments, they resonate at slightly different frequencies (chemical shifts). Diastereomers are different chemical compounds with different three-dimensional structures, and thus the corresponding protons within them are in chemically non-equivalent environments, leading to separate signals in an NMR spectrum. Enantiomers, in a standard achiral NMR solvent, would not show separate peaks because their protons are chemically equivalent. The fact that the integrals are roughly equal suggests the two diastereomers are present in a nearly 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the two species, resulting in two distinct peaks. This is possible because diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated using standard (achiral) chromatography. The use of elevated temperature can often improve the resolution between closely eluting compounds. The mass spectrometry (MS) data confirms that both separated peaks correspond to compounds of the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product. This rules out contamination with a precursor or a side-product with a different molecular formula.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images that have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard LC column and would produce identical NMR spectra. This contradicts the observations.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a chemically different molecule and would almost certainly have a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product, ruling this out.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and can therefore be distinguished by both NMR and LC without the need for a chiral resolving agent. This aligns perfectly with all the provided data: two NMR peaks for the same proton, two separable peaks on LC, and both having the same mass. This situation can arise during peptide synthesis if, for example, one of the chiral amino acid centers epimerizes (inverts its stereochemistry), creating a diastereomer of the intended peptide. Another possibility is the presence of atropisomers, which are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation around a single bond that can be separated and observed as distinct species in NMR and LC.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Double coupling is a technique used in peptide synthesis to improve the yield and purity by ensuring a coupling reaction goes to completion. It is a procedural step and not a chemical outcome that would result in a stable mixture of isomers with the observed characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers is the most logical explanation for the analytical data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
