    "The analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectra for each compound and their mixtures was correct. The search results confirm the predicted number of signals for each isomer.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it shows one singlet for the two aromatic protons and one singlet for the four equivalent methyl groups.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry, resulting in one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-5 and H-6). It has two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3, leading to two aliphatic singlets.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This isomer has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which should give two aromatic singlets. It has three sets of methyl groups (C1, C3, and the C2/C5 pair), resulting in three aliphatic singlets with a 1:1:2 ratio of protons.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum for this compound would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**Analysis of the Mixture:**\n\nThe problem states the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture has:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on this:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H or 1:1). This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would produce three singlets in the aromatic region (one from 1,2,3,4- and two from 1,2,3,5-), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would also result in three aromatic singlets (one from 1,2,4,5- and two from 1,2,3,5-), contradicting the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the only mixture that is consistent with the provided 1H NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
