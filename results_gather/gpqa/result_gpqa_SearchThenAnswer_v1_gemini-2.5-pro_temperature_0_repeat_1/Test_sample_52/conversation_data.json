    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound can be determined by systematically analyzing each piece of data.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms. All the proposed formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this, as they each contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information for identifying the molecular structure's components and, subsequently, its formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) correspond to the protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring with two substituents has the formula C₆H₄, meaning there are 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals for vinyl protons indicate the presence of a -CH=CH- group. The splitting patterns are key: one signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets for a vinyl proton strongly suggests it is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and to a methyl (-CH₃) group (giving the quartet). This points to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) as a fragment. This fragment contains 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons**: The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be located elsewhere in the molecule. In total, these two methyl groups account for 2 x 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   **Absence of -CH₂ Groups**: The lack of any signals corresponding to methylene (-CH₂) groups is a crucial constraint on the possible structure.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, the molecular formula can be calculated.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Count**:\n    *   From the di-substituted aromatic ring (C₆H₄): 4 hydrogens\n    *   From the vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 hydrogens\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -CH₃): 6 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.**\n    This hydrogen count immediately eliminates options B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₄O₂).\n\n*   **Carbon Count**:\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6 carbons\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-**C**OO-): 1 carbon\n    *   From the vinyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-): 2 carbons\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -**C**H₃): 2 carbons\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 11 carbons.**\n    This carbon count eliminates option D (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n\n*   **Oxygen Count**:\n    *   From the ester group (-C**O****O**-): 2 oxygens\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element gives a final molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which would exhibit all the described spectroscopic features: a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group giving rise to a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons, two distinct methyl signals, and no methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
