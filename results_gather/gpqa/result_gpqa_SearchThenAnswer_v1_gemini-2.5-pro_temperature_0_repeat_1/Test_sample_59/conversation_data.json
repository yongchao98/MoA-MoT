    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we identify the key information provided:\n*   **Average lifetime of the aliens:** 150 solar years\n*   **Astronaut's starting age:** 22 years\n*   **Spacecraft's constant speed (v):** 0.99999987 *c*\n*   **Destination:** Earth\n*   **Origin:** The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\n\n**Step 1: Determine the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud.**\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. According to astronomical observations, its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. Some older measurements placed it closer to 160,000 light-years. For our calculation, we will use the 160,000 light-year figure, as it aligns best with the provided options.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the time of the journey in Earth's reference frame (Δt_earth).**\nThe time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth as measured by an observer on Earth is the distance divided by the speed. Since the speed is extremely close to the speed of light (*c*), the travel time from Earth's perspective will be just slightly more than 160,000 years.\n\nTime (Earth) = Distance / Speed\nTime (Earth) = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987*c* ≈ 160,000.2 years\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nTime dilation is governed by the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the moving object. The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987*c*:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ = 1 / √0.00000026\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt_astronaut).**\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time) is the time measured on Earth divided by the Lorentz factor.\n\nTime (astronaut) = Time (Earth) / γ\nTime (astronaut) ≈ 160,000.2 years / 1961.16\nTime (astronaut) ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis value is approximately 81.6 years.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if the astronaut survives.**\nThe astronaut starts the journey at 22 years old. The trip takes about 81.6 years from their perspective.\nAstronaut's age on arrival = 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years.\n\nSince the astronaut's age upon arrival (103.6 years) is less than their average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The time elapsed for the astronaut is closest to 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
