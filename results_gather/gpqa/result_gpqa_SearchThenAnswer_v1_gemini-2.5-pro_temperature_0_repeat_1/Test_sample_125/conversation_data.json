    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at the C5 position, with the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the hydride from the achiral LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top or bottom face, two different stereoisomers are formed. The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration). The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have multiple chiral centers and are not mirror images of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„). This creates two new chiral centers at the C2 and C4 positions.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces all possible stereoisomers. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n4.  **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated as a distinct peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Assuming the products of Reaction I and Reaction II are all resolved from each other, the total number of peaks will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral, allowing it to interact differently with enantiomers and thus separate them.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) enantiomer from the (2S, 4S) enantiomer. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This results in **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks observed will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
