    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the IR and NMR Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly indicates that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet with a high chemical shift is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet representing a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet representing a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to both a methyl group and a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet representing a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (a methine group).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet representing a methine proton (-CH-) coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n*   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The signals correspond to a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectroscopic data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches the name in option (C).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Reaction and Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into a methyl group (-CH₃). The red phosphorus serves to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, allowing HI to be used in catalytic amounts.\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group. The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will have a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group attached to the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This correctly identifies the final product of the reduction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
