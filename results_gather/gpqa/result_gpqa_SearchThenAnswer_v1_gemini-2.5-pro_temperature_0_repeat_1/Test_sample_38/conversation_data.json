    "To determine the numerical value of the constant \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. According to the Born rule, the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a specific position x. Since it is known that the particles are always found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1, which signifies a 100% probability.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x)Ψ(x) = [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we set up the normalization integral, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in the specified region is 1.\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x]\n\nWe evaluate this definite integral from x=1 to x=3:\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), this simplifies to:\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this result equal to 1 and solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = √(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\na ≈ √(0.5 / 0.693)\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
