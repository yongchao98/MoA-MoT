First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy is the sum: `E_first_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**3.

Understand the Physics of the System\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this potential are quantized.\n*   **Energy Formula:** The energy of a single particle in the n-th quantum state is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, so the single-particle energy levels are simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers. For this system, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up or spin-down). This implies that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 2.

Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle in this potential are quantized and given by the formula $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n=1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.
