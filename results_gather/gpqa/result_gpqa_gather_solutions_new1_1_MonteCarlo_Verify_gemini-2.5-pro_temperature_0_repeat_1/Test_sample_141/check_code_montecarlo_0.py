def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the given quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the geometrical position (Bloch vector r) of the density matrix:
    ρ = 1/2 * (|0><0| + |1><1|)

    The relationship between a density matrix ρ and its Bloch vector r = (rx, ry, rz) is:
    ρ = 1/2 * (I + r_x*σ_x + r_y*σ_y + r_z*σ_z)

    From this, the components of the Bloch vector can be calculated as:
    r_i = Tr(ρ * σ_i)

    This function will:
    1. Construct the density matrix ρ from the question.
    2. Define the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.
    3. Calculate the Bloch vector r using the trace formula.
    4. Compare the calculated r with the vector from the chosen option C.
