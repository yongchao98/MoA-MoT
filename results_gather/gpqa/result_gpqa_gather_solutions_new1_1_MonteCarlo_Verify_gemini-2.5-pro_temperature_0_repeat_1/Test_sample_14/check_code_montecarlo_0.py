def check_transit_probability_answer():
    """
    This function verifies the answer to the exoplanet transit probability question.

    The core physics principles are:
    1.  The geometric transit probability (p) for a circular orbit is proportional to the stellar radius (R_s) divided by the planet's semi-major axis (a):
        p ∝ R_s / a
    2.  Kepler's Third Law relates the semi-major axis (a) to the orbital period (T) and the host star's mass (M_s):
        a³ ∝ T² * M_s  =>  a ∝ (T² * M_s)^(1/3)

    The problem provides the following relationships:
    -   Radii: R_s1 = R_s2
    -   Periods: T1 = T2 / 3  => T2 = 3 * T1
    -   Masses: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2

    We need to calculate the ratio of probabilities, p1 / p2.
    """

    # Step 1: Formulate the ratio of probabilities
    # p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)
    # Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to:
    # p1 / p2 = a2 / a1

    # Step 2: Formulate the ratio of semi-major axes
    # a2 / a1 = [ (T2² * M_s2) / (T1² * M_s1) ]^(1/3)
    # We can rewrite this in terms of ratios:
    # a2 / a1 = [ (T2/T1)² * (M_s2/M_s1) ]^(1/3)

    # Step 3: Substitute the given numerical ratios
    # T2 / T1 = 3
    # M_s1 / M_s2 = 2  => M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2
    try:
        ratio_T_squared = 3**2
        ratio_M_inverse = 1 / 2
        
        # The ratio p1/p2 is equal to a2/a1
        calculated_ratio = (ratio_T_squared * ratio_M_inverse)**(1/3)
        # calculated_ratio = (9 * 0.5)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred during the calculation: {e}"

    # Step 4: Check the calculated result against the provided answer 'C'
    # Answer C states: "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."
    
    # Constraint 1: The preferred planet must be Planet_1.
    # This is true if the calculated ratio p1/p2 is greater than 1.
    if calculated_ratio <= 1:
        return (f"Incorrect. The calculated probability ratio p1/p2 is {calculated_ratio:.3f}. "
                f"This means Planet_2 is preferred or the probabilities are equal, which contradicts the answer.")

    # Constraint 2: The factor must be approximately 1.65.
    expected_factor = 1.65
    # Using a tolerance of 1% for the word "approximately" (~)
    if not math.isclose(calculated_ratio, expected_factor, rel_tol=0.01):
        return (f"Incorrect. The calculated factor is {calculated_ratio:.3f}, which is not approximately {expected_factor}. "
                f"The answer's factor of {expected_factor} is not within a 1% tolerance of the calculated value.")

    # If all constraints are met, the answer is correct.
