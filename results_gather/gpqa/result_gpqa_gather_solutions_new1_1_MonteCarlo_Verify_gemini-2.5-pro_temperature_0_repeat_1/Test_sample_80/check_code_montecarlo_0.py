        'B': "Incorrect. Step 4, using hot potassium permanganate (KMnO4, heat), is an excessively harsh oxidation condition. While it can form the ketone, it is very likely to cause oxidative cleavage of the cyclopentane ring, leading to undesired side products like adipic acid. The use of a milder, more selective reagent like PCC is far superior.",
