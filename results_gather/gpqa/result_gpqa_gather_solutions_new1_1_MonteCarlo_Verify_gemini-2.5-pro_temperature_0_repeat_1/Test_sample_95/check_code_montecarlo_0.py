    # --- Given values from the question ---

    # --- Step 1: Convert units to SI ---
    # Convert distance from parsecs to meters
    d_meters = d_parsecs * parsec_to_meter
    # Convert angular size from degrees to radians

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs) ---
    # "Angular size" typically refers to the angular diameter.
    # The physical diameter is calculated using the small-angle approximation: D = d * Î¸.
    # The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is half of the physical diameter.
    # This is a critical step where errors are common. The provided answer handles this correctly.
    physical_diameter = d_meters * theta_radians

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the area of the event horizon ---
    # The area of the event horizon is the surface area of a sphere with radius Rs.
    Area = 4 * math.pi * Rs**2

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S) ---
    # The formula is S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * hbar)
    numerator = k_B * (c**3) * Area
    denominator = 4 * G * hbar
    entropy = numerator / denominator
