    """
    Analyzes the stereochemical outcome of the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.

    The function determines the number of possible products by:
    1. Identifying all unique stereoisomers formed.
    2. Grouping these stereoisomers into separable fractions (diastereomeric sets).
       A fraction is either a single meso compound or a racemic pair of enantiomers.
    3. Counting the number of these fractions.
