    Checks the correctness of the provided answer 'A' for the nuclear decay problem.

    This function programmatically models the two key physical constraints derived
    from the problem description:
    1.  The nature of the energy spectrum (continuous vs. discrete), which depends
        on the number of particles in the final state.
    2.  The change in the spectrum's endpoint energy, which depends on the
        rest masses of the emitted particles.

    It then verifies if the claims of the given answer ('A') are consistent with
    these physical constraints.

    # The final answer from the LLM that we are checking.
    llm_answer_choice = 'A'

    # --- Constraint 1: Nature of the Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete) ---
    # A decay spectrum is continuous if there are 3 or more particles in the
    # final state sharing the decay energy. We count the number of light particles
    # as they share the bulk of the kinetic energy.

    # Original decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. Final light particles = 2 (E) + 2 (V) = 4
    # Variant decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Final light particles = 2 (E) + 1 (M) = 3
    num_final_light_particles_variant = 3

    # The spectrum remains continuous if the variant decay also has >= 3 final particles.
    spectrum_remains_continuous = (num_final_light_particles_variant >= 3)

    # --- Constraint 2: Endpoint Energy Comparison ---
    # The endpoint is the maximum available kinetic energy. It is determined by the
    # total energy released (Q_nuc) minus the rest mass energy of all created light particles.
    # Since Q_nuc and the mass of E are constant, the change in the endpoint only
    # depends on the masses of the other emitted particles (V vs. M).

    # From the problem statement:
    # - V is a "much lighter particle", which implies it has a non-zero mass (m_V > 0).
    # - M is an "exotic, massless particle" (m_M = 0).

    # We can use placeholder values to represent this physical relationship.
    # The exact values don't matter, only their properties (positive vs. zero).
    m_V = 0.1  # Represents a small, positive mass
    m_M = 0.0  # Represents zero mass

    # The energy "cost" to create the non-E light particles in the original decay.
    mass_cost_original = 2 * m_V

    # The energy "cost" to create the non-E light particle in the variant decay.
    mass_cost_variant = m_M

    # The endpoint is higher when the mass cost is lower.
    # Therefore, the endpoint increases if mass_cost_variant < mass_cost_original.
    endpoint_increases = (mass_cost_variant < mass_cost_original)

    # --- Final Verification ---
    # We check if the provided answer 'A' aligns with our derived physical facts.
    # Option A states: "The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape,
    # and the endpoint increases."

        # Check if the conditions for option A are met by our physics model.
