    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question.
    The question asks for the number of possible organic products when
    1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.

    The reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.
    The code simulates the possible reaction pathways to count the unique products.

    # This is the major pathway due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H is weaker than C-D).
    # 1. Start: 1-bromobenzene-2-d
    # 2. Elimination: H from C6 and Br from C1 are removed.
    # 3. Intermediate: 3-deuterobenzyne (triple bond between C1 and C6, D is at C2).

    # 4. Addition of NH2- to 3-deuterobenzyne:
    # The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).

    # 4a. Attack at C1:
    # - The NH2 group adds to C1.
    # - The resulting product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D atom at C2.
    # - This product is named 2-deuteroaniline.

    # - To name this, we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group position 1.

    # - This product is named 3-deuteroaniline.

    # --- Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2 ---
    # This is a minor pathway but is still possible, so its products must be counted.
    # 1. Start: 1-bromobenzene-2-d
    # 2. Elimination: D from C2 and Br from C1 are removed.
    # 3. Intermediate: Benzyne (non-deuterated, triple bond between C1 and C2).

    # 4. Addition of NH2- to the non-deuterated benzyne:
    # The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2).

    # 4a/4b. Attack at C1 or C2:
    # - Since the intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium label,
