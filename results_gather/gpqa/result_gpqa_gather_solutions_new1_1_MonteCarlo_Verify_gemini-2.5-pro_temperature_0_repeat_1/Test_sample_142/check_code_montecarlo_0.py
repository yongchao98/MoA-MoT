    # --- Define Chemical Principles and Correct Answers ---

    # Principle for Reaction 1 (Determining A):
    # The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, a 6-membered ring ketone.
    # The Pinacol rearrangement can cause ring expansion.
    # Starting with a 5-membered ring (cyclopentanol derivative) allows for a favorable ring expansion to the 6-membered product.
    # Starting with a 6-membered ring (cyclohexanol derivative) would lead to an unfavorable expansion to a 7-membered ring.
    correct_A = "1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol"

    # Principle for Reaction 2 (Determining B):
    # The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.
    # Step 1: Formation of the most stable carbocation. The carbocation at C2 is tertiary and benzylic, making it more stable than the secondary carbocation at C3.
    # Step 2: 1,2-shift. A group from the adjacent carbon (C3) migrates. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen (H) and a methyl group (CH3).
    # The migratory aptitude is H > CH3. Therefore, a hydride shift occurs.
    # This leads to a ketone at the C3 position.
    correct_B = "methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate"
    
    # The other possible product for B, from a methyl shift, would be:
    incorrect_B_methyl_shift = "methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate"
