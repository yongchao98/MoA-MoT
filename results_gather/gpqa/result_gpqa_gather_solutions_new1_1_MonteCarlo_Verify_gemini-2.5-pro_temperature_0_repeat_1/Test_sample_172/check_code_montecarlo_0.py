    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of an electron.
    The solution involves two main steps:
    1. Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2) to find the minimum
       uncertainty in momentum (Δp).
    2. Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation (approximated as ΔE ≈ v * Δp)
       to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).
