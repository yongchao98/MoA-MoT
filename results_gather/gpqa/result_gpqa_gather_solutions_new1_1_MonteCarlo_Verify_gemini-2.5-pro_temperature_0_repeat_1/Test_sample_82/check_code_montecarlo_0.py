    # --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---
    # At this point, the solution is a buffer. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
    # pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
    
    pKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)

    # At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (acetate).

    # Concentration of acetate at equivalence point
    M_acetate_eq = moles_acetate / V_total_eq_L
    
    # The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-
    # We need the base dissociation constant, Kb
    Kb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid
    
    # Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]. Let x = [OH-]. Then Kb = x^2 / ([A-] - x)
    # Since Kb is very small, we can approximate [A-] - x ≈ [A-]
    # x^2 = Kb * [A-]
    # x = [OH-]
    conc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * M_acetate_eq)
    
    # Calculate pOH and then pH
    pOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)
