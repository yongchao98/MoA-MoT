Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density (`ρ`), is a constant.

2.  **Number of Stars in a Shell:** To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a thickness `dd`.
    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² dd`.
    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density times the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.
    *   Since `4πρ` is a constant, we have the proportionality: `dN ∝ d² dd`.

3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is defined as being inversely proportional to distance (`d`).
    *   `d = 1/plx` (using appropriate units).

4.  **Converting to Parallax Coordinates:** The goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We must convert our expression for `dN` from distance coordinates (`d`, `dd`) to parallax coordinates (`plx`, `d(plx)`).
    *   **Substitute `d`:** Replace `d` with `1/plx` in the proportionality: `dN ∝ (1/plx)² dd`.
    *   **Substitute `dd`:** We need to relate the differential `dd` to `d(plx)`. We do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:
        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`
        Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign: `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.

5.  **Final Combination:** Now, substitute the expression for `dd` into our proportionality for `dN`:
    *   `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * dd`
    *   `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`
    *   `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`

6.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`. From the final proportionality, we can see:
    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`

### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points

*   **Correct Derivation:** The derivation `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴` is performed correctly by the vast majority of the agents (e.g., Agents 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15). This shows a strong consensus on the physical and mathematical reasoning.

*   **Common Pitfall (Cumulative vs. Differential):** A frequent error in this type of problem is to calculate the *cumulative* number of stars instead of the number *per unit range*. The total number of stars up to a distance `d` is `N ∝ d³`. In terms of parallax, this is `N ∝ (1/plx)³ = 1/plx³`. This corresponds to option B. However, the question asks for the number "per unit range," which requires taking the derivative of the cumulative number, leading to the `1/plx⁴` relationship.

*   **Mapping Derivation to Options:** The most significant issue in the provided answers is a failure to correctly map the derived result (`1/plx⁴`) to the given options.
    *   A) ~ 1/plx^1
    *   B) ~ 1/plx^3
    *   C) ~ 1/plx^4
    *   D) ~ 1/plx^2
    The correct derivation `1/plx⁴` clearly corresponds to option **C**. However, many agents with the correct derivation chose B, D, or A.

*   **Consistent Agents:** Agents 10, 11, and 13 are the only ones that both perform the correct derivation and select the matching option, C. This internal consistency makes their answers the most reliable.

Based on the correct physical derivation, which is supported by the reasoning of most agents, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.
