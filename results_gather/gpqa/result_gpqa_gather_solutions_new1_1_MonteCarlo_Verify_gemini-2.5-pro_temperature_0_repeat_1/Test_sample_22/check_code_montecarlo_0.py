    # --- 3. Analyze the options based on chemical principles ---
    
    # Analysis of Option A:
    # Product 1, (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, is an anti-Markovnikov addition product.
    # This pathway is highly disfavored under ionic conditions (HBr alone) and typically requires
    # radical initiators (e.g., peroxides), which are not mentioned.
    reason_A = "Option A is incorrect because it includes an anti-Markovnikov addition product, which is not expected under the given ionic reaction conditions."

    # Analysis of Option B:
    # The products are phenols with a saturated 'butyl' side chain.
    # 1. This would require cleavage of the stable aryl-ether bond.
    # 2. It would also require reduction of the alkene's double bond. HBr is an acid and a source of a nucleophile, not a reducing agent.
    reason_B = "Option B is incorrect because the products are saturated, which would require a reduction reaction. HBr is not a reducing agent."

    # Analysis of Option C:
    # This option suggests a mixture of the Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition products.
    # While the Markovnikov product, (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, is plausible via simple addition,
    # the anti-Markovnikov product is not. Furthermore, this simple addition pathway ignores the
    # highly favorable intramolecular cyclization that is possible for this substrate.
    reason_C = "Option C is incorrect because it relies on the formation of the unlikely anti-Markovnikov product and ignores the more probable intramolecular cyclization pathway."

    # Analysis of Option D:
    # This option proposes two cyclic products. This is consistent with a well-established mechanism for such substrates.
    # Step 1: Protonation of the alkene by H+ follows Markovnikov's rule, forming a secondary carbocation.
    #         Intermediate: Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH(+)-CH3
    # Step 2 (Pathway 1 -> Product 1): The electron-rich benzene ring attacks the secondary carbocation directly.
    #         This intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation forms a 6-membered ring, yielding '3,3,4-trimethylchromane'.
    # Step 3 (Pathway 2 -> Product 2): The secondary carbocation rearranges via a 1,2-methyl shift to a more stable tertiary carbocation.
    #         Rearranged Intermediate: Ph-O-CH2-C(+)(Me)-CH(isopropyl)
    #         The benzene ring then attacks this more stable carbocation, forming a 5-membered ring, yielding '3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran'.
    # This mechanism perfectly explains the formation of two distinct products.
