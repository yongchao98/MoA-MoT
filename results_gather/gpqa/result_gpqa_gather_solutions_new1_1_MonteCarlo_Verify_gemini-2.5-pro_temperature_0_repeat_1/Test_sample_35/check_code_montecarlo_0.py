def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by performing the necessary astrophysical calculations.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Use the given distance (2.1 Gpc) and Hubble's Law to estimate the cosmological redshift (z).
    2.  Use the redshift to calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest) of the observed absorption line.
    3.  Compare the calculated E_rest to the known energy of the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI).
    4.  Based on the identification of the line and the fact that it's an *absorption* line, determine the correct phase of the interstellar medium.
    5.  Compare this derived answer with the provided answer.

    # --- Step 3: Identify the Transition ---

    # In radio astronomy, 21-cm *absorption* lines are a key tracer of the COLD atomic medium (CNM)
    # because absorption strength is inversely proportional to the gas temperature.
