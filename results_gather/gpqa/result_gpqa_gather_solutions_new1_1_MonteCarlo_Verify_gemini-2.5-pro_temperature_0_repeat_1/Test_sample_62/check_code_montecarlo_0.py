    # --- Step 1: Identify the Transition ---
    # The molecule starts in the fundamental (ground) state: v=0, J=0.
    # The selection rules for photon absorption are Δv=+1 and ΔJ=±1.
    # Starting from J=0, only ΔJ=+1 is possible.
    # Therefore, the final state is v=1, J=1.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE) ---
    # The energy of a state (v, J) is E = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I)J(J+1).
    # The transition energy is ΔE = E(1,1) - E(0,0).
    # ΔE = [ħω(3/2) + (ħ²/2I)*1*(2)] - [ħω(1/2) + 0]
    # ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I
