def check_cern_decay_resolution():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the CERN Bubble Chamber problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays
    of a particle X^0 with a proper lifetime of 8e-16 s, a total energy of 27 GeV,
    and a rest mass of 3.41 GeV.

    The provided answer is C) 2.08e-6 m.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the given physical constants and the candidate answer.
    2. Calculates the particle's momentum in the lab frame using the relativistic
       energy-momentum relation.
    3. Calculates the particle's mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame.
    4. Calculates the required resolution based on the exponential decay law. It checks two
       interpretations:
       a) The maximum resolution that allows observing at least 30% of decays.
       b) The resolution required to observe exactly 1/3 of decays (a common refinement
          in such problems that often leads to the intended answer).
    5. Compares the candidate answer with the calculated values to determine its correctness.
