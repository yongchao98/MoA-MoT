    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the physics problem.
    
    The problem relates the fraction of surviving particles (f) to their Lorentz factor (γ).
    The relationship is f = exp(-K/γ), where K is a constant.
    This can be rewritten as γ * ln(1/f) = K.
    
    Since K is constant for both scenarios, we can state:
    γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)
    
    We can then solve for the unknown Lorentz factor, γ₂.
