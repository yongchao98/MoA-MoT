    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for a Pinacol rearrangement question.

    The function simulates the reaction mechanism by:
    1. Defining chemical groups with relative scores for carbocation stabilization
       and migratory aptitude.
    2. For each reaction, determining the most stable carbocation.
    3. For each reaction, determining the group with the highest migratory aptitude
       from the adjacent carbon.
    4. Deriving the name of the final product based on the mechanism.
    5. Comparing the derived products with the products listed in the provided answer (Option C).
