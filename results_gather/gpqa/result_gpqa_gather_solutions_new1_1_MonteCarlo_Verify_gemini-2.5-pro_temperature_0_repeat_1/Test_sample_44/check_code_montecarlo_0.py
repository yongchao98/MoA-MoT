    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state,
    and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D
    infinite potential well.

    Key Principles:
    1.  Spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
    2.  Each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).
    3.  The energy of a single particle in level 'n' is E_n = n^2 * E.
