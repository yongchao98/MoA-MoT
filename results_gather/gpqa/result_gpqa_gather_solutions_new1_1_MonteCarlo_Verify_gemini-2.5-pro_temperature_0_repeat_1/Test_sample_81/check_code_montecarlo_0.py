    # --- Final Verification ---
    # Candidate A has cis-esters: (10S, 11R) -> Correct.
    # Candidate A is an anti-adduct: (4aR, 4bR, 8aS, 8bS) -> Correct.
    # Candidate B has trans-esters: (10R, 11R) -> Incorrect.

    # Since A satisfies all criteria for the major product, the answer is correct.
