    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer based on the physics of mean free path.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1.  The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ).
    2.  λ1 (gas-gas) = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)
    3.  λ2 (electron-gas) = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    4.  The ratio λ2/λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg.
    5.  The crucial physical insight is that for very high-energy electrons (1000 keV),
        the scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is much SMALLER than the gas-gas kinetic
        cross-section (σ_gg).
    6.  Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number much greater than 1.
    7.  This makes λ2/λ1 a number much greater than √2 (≈1.414).
    8.  This result is then compared against the given options.

An analysis of the provided answers reveals two opposing lines of reasoning. To determine the correct answer, we must carefully examine the underlying physics of mean free path (MFP) for the two distinct scenarios.

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The MFP (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section. In this problem, the number density 'n' of the residual gas molecules is constant for both scenarios. Therefore, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by their respective collision cross-sections.

2.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**
    *   This is the MFP of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.
    *   Since all particles are in random thermal motion, kinetic theory dictates that the formula must account for the average relative velocity, introducing a factor of √2.
    *   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**, where σ_gg is the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas collision. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.

3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**
    *   This is the MFP of a high-energy electron (1000 kV) scattering off a gas molecule.
    *   The electron's velocity is extremely high (relativistic), making the thermal velocity of the gas molecules negligible. The gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor is not used.
    *   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**, where σ_eg is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas collision.

4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):** This is the most critical point and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers.
    *   **Incorrect Argument:** Several answers (3, 5, 10, 12, 13) argue that σ_eg is larger than σ_gg. They reason that the electron is a charged particle and interacts via the long-range Coulomb force, giving the molecule a larger effective target area than for a neutral molecule-molecule collision. While this is true for *low-energy* electrons, it is incorrect for the high-energy electrons in this problem.
    *   **Correct Argument:** The problem specifies a 1000 kV accelerating voltage, meaning the electrons have 1000 keV (1 MeV) of energy. At such high energies, electrons are extremely penetrating. The atom appears as mostly empty space, and a significant scattering event requires a very close approach to the nucleus. The scattering cross-section (σ_eg) for high-energy particles is known to be very small. The gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg), based on the physical size of the molecules, is much larger. Therefore, **σ_gg >> σ_eg**.

5.  **Determine the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**
    *   We can find the ratio of the two MFPs:
        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]
    *   Simplifying gives:
        **λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg**
    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414 and the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1, the overall ratio (λ2 / λ1) must be a number significantly greater than 1.414.
    *   This leads to the definitive conclusion: **λ2 >> λ1**.

6.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: False. The ratio λ2/λ1 is much larger than 1.22.
    *   B) λ2 = λ1: False. The collision physics are completely different.
    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: True. Our analysis shows λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, so it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1.
    *   D) λ2 < λ1: False. This is the opposite of our finding.

The mean free path of the high-energy electrons is much longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules because the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is much smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two gas molecules.
