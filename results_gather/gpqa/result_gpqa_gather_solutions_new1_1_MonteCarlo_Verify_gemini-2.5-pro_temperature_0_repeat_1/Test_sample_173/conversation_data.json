  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)\n\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully calculated the required physical quantities to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, it determined the rest-mass energies of the two fragments based on the given conditions: the more massive fragment (`m1`) has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV, and the lighter fragment (`m2`) has a rest-mass energy of 99 GeV. The total kinetic energy released in the fission (`Q`) was calculated as the difference between the initial rest-mass energy (300 GeV) and the sum of the final rest-mass energies (297 GeV), resulting in `Q = 3 GeV`.\n\nNext, the script calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using two different models:\n1.  **Classical Approximation:** `T1_classical` was found to be 1000 MeV.\n2.  **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct `T1_relativistic` was found to be 1005 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`. This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, E_M = M * c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 and m2.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m1, and the less massive is m2.\n    *   Mass relationship: m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n*   Substitute m1 = 2 * m2 into the sum: 2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M, which gives 3*m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   Solve for m2: m2 = 0.33 * M.\n*   Solve for m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M.\n\nNow, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of m1: E_m1 = m1 * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of m2: E_m2 = m2 * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   |p1| = |p2|\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nThe relationship between total relativistic energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\nKinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy: T = E - m*c², so E = T + m*c².\n\nFrom the momentum and energy equations:\n*   (p1*c)² = E1² - (m1*c²)² = (T1 + m1*c²)² - (m1*c²)²\n*   (p2*c)² = E2² - (m2*c²)² = (T2 + m2*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we have (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   (T1 + m1*c²)² - (m1*c²)² = (T2 + m2*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n*   T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n\nWe know T2 = 3 - T1, m1*c² = 198 GeV, and m2*c² = 99 GeV. Substitute these values:\n*   T1² + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)² + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\n*   T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n*   600*T1 = 603\n*   **T1 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p1 = p2. We can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = [p1² / (2*m1)] / [p2² / (2*m2)] = m2 / m1\n\nSince m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2  =>  T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy, T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV:\n*   T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConvert this value to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as:\n    *   E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2 * m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁):\n    E₁ = m₁ * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂):\n    E₂ = m₂ * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\nQ = E_initial - (E₁ + E₂)\nQ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\np₁ = p₂\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E_total), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is E_total² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The total energy is also the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy (T): E_total = T + m*c².\n\nTherefore:\n(T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁*c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂*c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 - T₁. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\nT₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂. Therefore:\nT₁ = p₁² / (2m₁)\nT₂ = p₂² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (p₁² / (2m₁)) / (p₂² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, we have:\nT₁ / T₂ = m₂ / (2*m₂) = 1/2\nT₂ = 2 * T₁\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy Q = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV:\nT₁ + 2*T₁ = 3 GeV\n3*T₁ = 3 GeV\nT₁ (classical) = 1 GeV\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁ is:\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass: M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The nucleus splits into *only* these two fragments.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments\n\nWe are given two conditions for the fragment masses:\n1.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass:\n    m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n2.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n    m₁ = 2 * m₂\n\nNow, substitute the second equation into the first:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nUsing this, we can find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nSo, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass of m₁ = 0.66 * M.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy = M * c² = 300 GeV\n*   Final rest-mass energy = (m₁ + m₂) * c² = (0.99 * M) * c² = 0.99 * (M * c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n\nThe Q-value is:\nQ = Initial Energy - Final Energy = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum (p).\n\n*   p₁ = m₁ * v₁\n*   p₂ = m₂ * v₂\n*   p₁ = p₂ = p\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2 * m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2 * m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2 * m₁)) / (p² / (2 * m₂)) = m₂ / m₁\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, the ratio is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / (2 * m₂) = 1/2  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁\n\nIn special relativity, momentum conservation (p₁ = p₂) still holds. The relationship between energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum:\n(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)²\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = T + m*c².\n(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n\nWe apply this to both fragments:\n*   (p₁*c)² = T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (m₁*c²)\n*   (p₂*c)² = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * (m₂*c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   m₁*c² = 0.66 * M*c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n*   m₂*c² = 0.33 * M*c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)². We also know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁.\nT₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n\nNow, we solve for T₁:\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial and final states and extract given values.**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   The nucleus splits into nothing else, so energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We designate $m_1$ as the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rest masses (and rest energies) of the two fragments.**\n\n1.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n3.  Now find $m_1$:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n4.  Calculate their rest energies using the initial rest energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   Rest energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy.\n*   $Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final total rest energy})$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Conservation of Momentum.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so its momentum was zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using the classical approximation.**\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n2.  Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$):\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n3.  The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4.  This gives us the relation $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n5.  Using the total kinetic energy, $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n1.  We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.  Rearranging for momentum, and using the total energy $E = T + m_0c^2$, we get:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n3.  Since momentum is conserved ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n4.  Substitute the known values: $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n5.  Simplify the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n    *   $396T_1 = -204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{correct}} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the difference and convert units.**\n\n1.  The difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n2.  Convert the result from GeV to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The phrase \"2 times more massive\" was interpreted as $m_1 = 2m_2$, which is standard in physics problems and leads to a valid answer choice.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both energy and momentum conservation were correctly applied.\n*   **Formulas:** The distinct formulas for kinetic energy and its relation to momentum in classical vs. relativistic mechanics were used.\n*   **Units:** All calculations were performed consistently in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV as required by the answer options.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (Mc²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Sum of fragment rest-mass energies (m₁c² + m₂c²):** This is 99% of the initial energy.\n    m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   **Mass relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n    m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²\n\nNow, we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies of the fragments:\nSubstitute the mass relationship into the sum:\n2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV\n**m₂c² = 99 GeV** (less massive fragment)\n\nThen, solve for the more massive fragment:\n**m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy.\nQ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 2. Calculate the Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁)\n\nIn any decay process, both total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must be emitted with equal and opposite momenta.\n\nUsing the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic mechanics, the total energy of the more massive fragment (E₁) can be calculated with the following formula:\n\nE₁ = [ (Mc²)² + (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)² ] / [ 2 * Mc² ]\n\nPlugging in the values:\nE₁ = [ (300)² + (198)² - (99)² ] / [ 2 * 300 ]\nE₁ = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\nE₁ = 119403 / 600\n**E₁ = 199.005 GeV**\n\nThe kinetic energy (T₁) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\nT₁ = E₁ - m₁c²\nT₁ = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n**T₁ = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T₁_classical)\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is distributed inversely proportional to the mass of the fragments to conserve momentum (p = mv, T = ½mv²).\n\n*   p₁ = p₂ => m₁v₁ = m₂v₂\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (½m₁v₁²) / (½m₂v₂²) = (m₁/m₂) * (v₁/v₂)²\n*   From the momentum relation, v₁/v₂ = m₂/m₁, so (v₁/v₂)² = (m₂/m₁)²\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (m₁/m₂) * (m₂/m₁)² = m₂/m₁\n\nSo, T₁_classical = (m₂/m₁) * T₂_classical.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\nQ = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₂_classical = (m₁/m₂) * T₁_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nSubstitute this into the total energy equation:\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Define the System and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass `M`.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter one `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2`\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1_cl = p2_cl`).\n\n*   The kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is also conserved (`p1 = p2`). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the equation:\n    `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding the terms (`(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999893` is a result of floating-point precision in computation, which is effectively 5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is $P_{initial} = 0$.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the more massive fragment as $m_1$ and the lighter one as $m_2$. So, $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_1 + T_2$).\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T_{cl} = p^2 / (2m)$.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum:\n$Q = T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3T_{1,cl}$\nSolving for the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n$T_{1,cl} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can express the momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n\nAgain, conservation of momentum requires $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, which means $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We rearrange the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = Mc^2 - Q$. Substituting this in:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2 - Q) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2Mc^2] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem has been solved through a step-by-step calculation.\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Fragments' Properties:**\n    *   The sum of the fragments' rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial one: `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   Solving these two equations gives:\n        *   `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` (the more massive fragment).\n        *   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV` (the less massive fragment).\n\n3.  **Energy Released:**\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the mass defect: `T_total = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Kinetic Energy Calculation (T1 for the more massive fragment):**\n    *   **Relativistic (Correct) Calculation:** Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`, we derived and calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n        `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Classical (Approximation) Calculation:** Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p^2 / (2m)`, we derived and calculated the approximate kinetic energy:\n        `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Difference:**\n    *   The difference between the two values is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting this to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1.

Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Also, total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSetting them equal and substituting `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2*m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2*m1) / (p^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5.

We are given:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The mass of the more massive fragment (m₁) is twice that of the less massive fragment (m₂): m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first relation into the second, we get:\n2 * m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = Initial Energy - Final Energy\n*   Q = (M*c²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the conservation of both energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   E₁² = (p₁c)² + (m₁c²)²\n*   E₂² = (p₂c)² + (m₂c²)²\n\nSince |p₁| = |p₂|, we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)². Therefore:\nE₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n\nWe also know the total energy of the system is conserved:\nE₁ + E₂ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\nE₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (39204 - 9801) GeV²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 29403 GeV²\nE₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\nThe kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n*   T₁ (relativistic) = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Approximate (Classical) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m). From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\nm₁T₁ = m₂T₂\n\nUsing the mass relationship m₁ = 2m₂, we get:\n2m₂ * T₁ = m₂ * T₂\n2T₁ = T₂\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\nT₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\nSubstituting 2T₁ for T₂:\nT₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV\n3T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConverting this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)\n\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe process was successful. The randomized exploration (interpreted as checking the discrete options) proposed 'D' as the likely answer. The deterministic verification, which checked for relativistic momentum conservation, confirmed that 'D' is the only option that satisfies the physical laws governing the fission process. The external checker has also validated this result as correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of a fission fragment using both relativistic and classical physics and then find the difference. My proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the rest masses of the two fragments using the given ratios. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. The final total rest mass is 99% of the initial, and one fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n2.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies (the Q-value).\n3.  Using conservation of momentum and the relativistic energy-momentum relation, set up an equation to solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n4.  Repeat the calculation for T1 using the classical relationship between kinetic energy, momentum, and mass.\n5.  Finally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 and convert it to MeV.\n\nThis is a calculation-based problem, so no external search is needed.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed path is logical. However, I must raise a few points to ensure accuracy:\n1.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving a quadratic equation. A simple sign error or mistake in expansion could lead to an incorrect result. The algebraic steps must be double-checked.\n2.  **Formula Integrity:** The core of the relativistic calculation is the relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`. Is this formula correct? Yes, it derives directly from `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` and `E = T + mc^2`.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The application of conservation of energy (to find the total kinetic energy) and conservation of momentum (to relate the two fragments' energies) is fundamental. The assumption that momenta are equal and opposite (`|p1| = |p2|`) is correct for a decay from rest.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The initial data is in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. A final conversion step (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is required and must not be forgotten.\n\n**Decision:** The proposer's plan is sound, and the skeptic's concerns are valid checks on the execution rather than flaws in the plan itself. The next and only action is to perform the detailed calculation.\n\n***\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Determine Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Let the rest-mass energies of the fragments be `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The energy released is the loss in rest mass: `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_rel):**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`.\n    *   Using the relativistic relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`:\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198`, and `m2*c^2 = 99` (all in GeV):\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n        `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_class):**\n    *   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n    *   `T1 / T2 = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV` => `3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and identifying key points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n        *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2 * m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n        *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   From the given relationships, we can find the fragments' masses in terms of `M`. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n        *   This means `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    *   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This step is foundational. All subsequent calculations depend on these values. All agents who performed this calculation did so correctly.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n    *   **Concept:** The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy, according to `E=mc²`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `Q = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final total rest-mass energy)`\n        *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n        *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`. This is also consistently calculated correctly.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n    *   **Concept:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`). In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n        *   `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n        *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV` -> `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`.\n        *   `3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This establishes the baseline approximate value.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n    *   **Concept:** Momentum is still conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n        *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        *   The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n        *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        *   `600T₁ = 603`\n        *   `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The algebra here is the most complex part of the problem and must be done carefully. The derivation is consistent across almost all candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference and Final Answer**\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n        *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we must convert. `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n        *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n    *   **Mapping to Options:**\n        *   A) 5 MeV\n        *   B) 2 MeV\n        *   C) 10 MeV\n        *   D) 20 MeV\n    *   The calculated difference of 5 MeV matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nThe overwhelming majority of the agents correctly calculated the numerical answer to be 5 MeV.

Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, E_M = M * c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 and m2.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m1, and the less massive is m2.\n    *   Mass relationship: m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n*   Substitute m1 = 2 * m2 into the sum: 2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M, which gives 3*m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   Solve for m2: m2 = 0.33 * M.\n*   Solve for m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M.\n\nNow, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of m1: E_m1 = m1 * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of m2: E_m2 = m2 * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   |p1| = |p2|\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nThe relationship between total relativistic energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\nKinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy: T = E - m*c², so E = T + m*c².\n\nFrom the momentum and energy equations:\n*   (p1*c)² = E1² - (m1*c²)² = (T1 + m1*c²)² - (m1*c²)²\n*   (p2*c)² = E2² - (m2*c²)² = (T2 + m2*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we have (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   (T1 + m1*c²)² - (m1*c²)² = (T2 + m2*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n*   T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n\nWe know T2 = 3 - T1, m1*c² = 198 GeV, and m2*c² = 99 GeV. Substitute these values:\n*   T1² + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)² + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\n*   T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n*   600*T1 = 603\n*   **T1 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p1 = p2. We can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = [p1² / (2*m1)] / [p2² / (2*m2)] = m2 / m1\n\nSince m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2  =>  T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy, T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV:\n*   T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConvert this value to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as:\n    *   E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2 * m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁):\n    E₁ = m₁ * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂):\n    E₂ = m₂ * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\nQ = E_initial - (E₁ + E₂)\nQ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\np₁ = p₂\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E_total), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is E_total² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The total energy is also the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy (T): E_total = T + m*c².\n\nTherefore:\n(T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁*c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂*c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 - T₁. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies:\nT₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\nT₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂. Therefore:\nT₁ = p₁² / (2m₁)\nT₂ = p₂² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (p₁² / (2m₁)) / (p₂² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, we have:\nT₁ / T₂ = m₂ / (2*m₂) = 1/2\nT₂ = 2 * T₁\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy Q = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV:\nT₁ + 2*T₁ = 3 GeV\n3*T₁ = 3 GeV\nT₁ (classical) = 1 GeV\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁ is:\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass: M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The nucleus splits into *only* these two fragments.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments\n\nWe are given two conditions for the fragment masses:\n1.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass:\n    m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n2.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n    m₁ = 2 * m₂\n\nNow, substitute the second equation into the first:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nUsing this, we can find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nSo, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass of m₁ = 0.66 * M.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy = M * c² = 300 GeV\n*   Final rest-mass energy = (m₁ + m₂) * c² = (0.99 * M) * c² = 0.99 * (M * c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n\nThe Q-value is:\nQ = Initial Energy - Final Energy = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum (p).\n\n*   p₁ = m₁ * v₁\n*   p₂ = m₂ * v₂\n*   p₁ = p₂ = p\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2 * m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2 * m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2 * m₁)) / (p² / (2 * m₂)) = m₂ / m₁\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, the ratio is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / (2 * m₂) = 1/2  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁\n\nIn special relativity, momentum conservation (p₁ = p₂) still holds. The relationship between energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum:\n(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)²\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = T + m*c².\n(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n\nWe apply this to both fragments:\n*   (p₁*c)² = T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (m₁*c²)\n*   (p₂*c)² = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * (m₂*c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   m₁*c² = 0.66 * M*c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n*   m₂*c² = 0.33 * M*c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)². We also know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁.\nT₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n\nNow, we solve for T₁:\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial and final states and extract given values.**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   The nucleus splits into nothing else, so energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We designate $m_1$ as the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rest masses (and rest energies) of the two fragments.**\n\n1.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n3.  Now find $m_1$:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n4.  Calculate their rest energies using the initial rest energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   Rest energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy.\n*   $Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final total rest energy})$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Conservation of Momentum.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so its momentum was zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using the classical approximation.**\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n2.  Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$):\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n3.  The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4.  This gives us the relation $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n5.  Using the total kinetic energy, $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n1.  We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.  Rearranging for momentum, and using the total energy $E = T + m_0c^2$, we get:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n3.  Since momentum is conserved ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n4.  Substitute the known values: $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n5.  Simplify the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n    *   $396T_1 = -204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{correct}} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the difference and convert units.**\n\n1.  The difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n2.  Convert the result from GeV to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The phrase \"2 times more massive\" was interpreted as $m_1 = 2m_2$, which is standard in physics problems and leads to a valid answer choice.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both energy and momentum conservation were correctly applied.\n*   **Formulas:** The distinct formulas for kinetic energy and its relation to momentum in classical vs. relativistic mechanics were used.\n*   **Units:** All calculations were performed consistently in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV as required by the answer options.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (Mc²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Sum of fragment rest-mass energies (m₁c² + m₂c²):** This is 99% of the initial energy.\n    m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   **Mass relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n    m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²\n\nNow, we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies of the fragments:\nSubstitute the mass relationship into the sum:\n2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV\n**m₂c² = 99 GeV** (less massive fragment)\n\nThen, solve for the more massive fragment:\n**m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy.\nQ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 2. Calculate the Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁)\n\nIn any decay process, both total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must be emitted with equal and opposite momenta.\n\nUsing the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic mechanics, the total energy of the more massive fragment (E₁) can be calculated with the following formula:\n\nE₁ = [ (Mc²)² + (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)² ] / [ 2 * Mc² ]\n\nPlugging in the values:\nE₁ = [ (300)² + (198)² - (99)² ] / [ 2 * 300 ]\nE₁ = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\nE₁ = 119403 / 600\n**E₁ = 199.005 GeV**\n\nThe kinetic energy (T₁) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\nT₁ = E₁ - m₁c²\nT₁ = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n**T₁ = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T₁_classical)\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is distributed inversely proportional to the mass of the fragments to conserve momentum (p = mv, T = ½mv²).\n\n*   p₁ = p₂ => m₁v₁ = m₂v₂\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (½m₁v₁²) / (½m₂v₂²) = (m₁/m₂) * (v₁/v₂)²\n*   From the momentum relation, v₁/v₂ = m₂/m₁, so (v₁/v₂)² = (m₂/m₁)²\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (m₁/m₂) * (m₂/m₁)² = m₂/m₁\n\nSo, T₁_classical = (m₂/m₁) * T₂_classical.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\nQ = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₂_classical = (m₁/m₂) * T₁_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nSubstitute this into the total energy equation:\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Define the System and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass `M`.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter one `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2`\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1_cl = p2_cl`).\n\n*   The kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is also conserved (`p1 = p2`). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the equation:\n    `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding the terms (`(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999893` is a result of floating-point precision in computation, which is effectively 5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.

Let's denote the more massive fragment as $m_1$ and the lighter one as $m_2$. So, $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_1 + T_2$).\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T_{cl} = p^2 / (2m)$.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum:\n$Q = T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3T_{1,cl}$\nSolving for the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n$T_{1,cl} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can express the momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n\nAgain, conservation of momentum requires $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, which means $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We rearrange the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = Mc^2 - Q$. Substituting this in:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2 - Q) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2Mc^2] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem has been solved through a step-by-step calculation.\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Fragments' Properties:**\n    *   The sum of the fragments' rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial one: `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   Solving these two equations gives:\n        *   `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` (the more massive fragment).\n        *   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV` (the less massive fragment).\n\n3.  **Energy Released:**\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the mass defect: `T_total = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Kinetic Energy Calculation (T1 for the more massive fragment):**\n    *   **Relativistic (Correct) Calculation:** Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`, we derived and calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n        `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Classical (Approximation) Calculation:** Using conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) and the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p^2 / (2m)`, we derived and calculated the approximate kinetic energy:\n        `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Difference:**\n    *   The difference between the two values is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting this to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We can set up a system of equations for their rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Also, total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSetting them equal and substituting `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2*m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2*m1) / (p^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   Sum of rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Solving for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Solving for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `E_m1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `E_m2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   Total kinetic energy (`T_total`): `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p1 = p2 = p` (in magnitude).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the classical kinetic energies is:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nFor relativistic calculations, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy of a fragment is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   So, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nEquating the two expressions:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nNow, simplify the equation to solve for `T1`:\n*   `396 * T1 = -204 * T1 + 603`\n*   `600 * T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6.

Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We are given:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The mass of the more massive fragment (m₁) is twice that of the less massive fragment (m₂): m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first relation into the second, we get:\n2 * m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = Initial Energy - Final Energy\n*   Q = (M*c²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the conservation of both energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   E₁² = (p₁c)² + (m₁c²)²\n*   E₂² = (p₂c)² + (m₂c²)²\n\nSince |p₁| = |p₂|, we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)². Therefore:\nE₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n\nWe also know the total energy of the system is conserved:\nE₁ + E₂ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\nE₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (39204 - 9801) GeV²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 29403 GeV²\nE₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\nThe kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n*   T₁ (relativistic) = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Approximate (Classical) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m). From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\nm₁T₁ = m₂T₂\n\nUsing the mass relationship m₁ = 2m₂, we get:\n2m₂ * T₁ = m₂ * T₂\n2T₁ = T₂\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\nT₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\nSubstituting 2T₁ for T₂:\nT₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV\n3T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConverting this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

The deterministic verification, which checked for relativistic momentum conservation, confirmed that 'D' is the only option that satisfies the physical laws governing the fission process. The external checker has also validated this result as correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of a fission fragment using both relativistic and classical physics and then find the difference. My proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the rest masses of the two fragments using the given ratios. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. The final total rest mass is 99% of the initial, and one fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n2.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies (the Q-value).\n3.  Using conservation of momentum and the relativistic energy-momentum relation, set up an equation to solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n4.  Repeat the calculation for T1 using the classical relationship between kinetic energy, momentum, and mass.\n5.  Finally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 and convert it to MeV.\n\nThis is a calculation-based problem, so no external search is needed.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed path is logical. However, I must raise a few points to ensure accuracy:\n1.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving a quadratic equation. A simple sign error or mistake in expansion could lead to an incorrect result. The algebraic steps must be double-checked.\n2.  **Formula Integrity:** The core of the relativistic calculation is the relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`. Is this formula correct? Yes, it derives directly from `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` and `E = T + mc^2`.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The application of conservation of energy (to find the total kinetic energy) and conservation of momentum (to relate the two fragments' energies) is fundamental. The assumption that momenta are equal and opposite (`|p1| = |p2|`) is correct for a decay from rest.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The initial data is in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. A final conversion step (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is required and must not be forgotten.\n\n**Decision:** The proposer's plan is sound, and the skeptic's concerns are valid checks on the execution rather than flaws in the plan itself. The next and only action is to perform the detailed calculation.\n\n***\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Determine Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Let the rest-mass energies of the fragments be `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The energy released is the loss in rest mass: `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_rel):**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`.\n    *   Using the relativistic relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`:\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198`, and `m2*c^2 = 99` (all in GeV):\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n        `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_class):**\n    *   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n    *   `T1 / T2 = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV` => `3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
