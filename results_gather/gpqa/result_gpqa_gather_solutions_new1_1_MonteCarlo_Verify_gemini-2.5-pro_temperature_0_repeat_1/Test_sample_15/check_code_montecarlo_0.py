    Verifies the count of optically active compounds from a given list.

    The function encodes the chemical analysis for each compound:
    - A compound is optically active if it is chiral.
    - Chirality is determined by the absence of internal symmetry elements (plane of symmetry, center of inversion).
    - The presence of stereochemical descriptors (R, S) in a name for a non-meso compound indicates a specific, optically active enantiomer.
    - Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral due to internal symmetry.
