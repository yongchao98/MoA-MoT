    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the textile dye problem.
    
    The core logic is:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from the given energy.
    2. Identify the color of the emitted light.
    3. Apply the principle of Stokes Shift for fluorescence, which states that
       the absorbed light must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted light.
    4. Evaluate the given options against this principle.
    5. Select the most plausible option among the valid candidates.
