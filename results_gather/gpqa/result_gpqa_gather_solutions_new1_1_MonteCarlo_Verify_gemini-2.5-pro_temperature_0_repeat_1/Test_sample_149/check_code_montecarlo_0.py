    # --- Step 1: Deduce the Starting Material ---
    # Based on NMR data analysis:
    # 9.72 (t, 1H) & 3.66 (d, 2H) -> -CH2-CHO fragment
    # 6.98 (d, 2H) & 6.51 (d, 2H) -> para-disubstituted benzene ring
    # 6.27 (bs, 2H) -> primary amine (-NH2)
    # Molecular Formula C8H9NO is consistent.
    # Conclusion: The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
    starting_material = "4-aminophenylacetaldehyde"

    # --- Step 2: Simulate the Reaction Sequence ---
    
    # Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O) perform diazotization followed by hydrolysis.
    # This converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to a phenol (-OH).
    # The product after the first two steps is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.
    intermediate_product = "4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde"

    # Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat) performs a self-aldol condensation.
    # The "Heat" condition is a critical constraint. It ensures the reaction does not stop
    # at the aldol addition stage but proceeds to the dehydrated condensation product.
    
    # The aldol addition product (without heat) would be Option D.
