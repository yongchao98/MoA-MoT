    Question: What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?
    Options:
        A) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone
        B) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol
        C) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol
        D) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone
    Provided Answer: A

    # 1. Define the chemical principles for the reaction.
    # The reaction is between an enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol) and a halogen (Br2).
    # Principle 1: The reaction of an enol with a halogen is a classic alpha-halogenation.
    # Principle 2: The reaction is thermodynamically driven by the formation of a stable carbonyl (C=O) group.
    # Principle 3: The halogen (Br) adds to the alpha-carbon (the carbon of the C=C bond that does NOT have the -OH group).
    # Principle 4: The enol's C-OH group becomes a C=O group (ketone).
    # Principle 5: Spectator groups (the 4,4-dimethyl groups) are unaffected.

    # 2. Apply the principles to predict the correct product.
    # - Starting material: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The enol involves C1 (with -OH) and C2.
    # - The alpha-carbon is C2.
    # - Applying Principle 3: Bromine adds to C2.
    # - Applying Principle 4: The C1-OH becomes a C1=O.
    # - Applying Principle 5: The 4,4-dimethyl groups remain.
    # - Predicted Product Name: "2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone"
