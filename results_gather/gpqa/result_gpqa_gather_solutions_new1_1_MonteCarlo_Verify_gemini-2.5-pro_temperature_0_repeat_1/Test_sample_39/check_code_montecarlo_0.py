    # --- Knowledge Base and Reasoning ---
    # 1. The phrase "on top of each other" is a common colloquialism in organic chemistry labs.
    # 2. It's a visual description, strongly implying a technique where results are visualized as spots or bands,
    #    which is characteristic of Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.
    # 3. The primary principle of separation in these common chromatography techniques is polarity.
    # 4. If compounds have very similar polarities, they will not separate effectively and will appear as
    #    overlapping spots on a TLC plate, hence "on top of each other".
    # 5. Other options are less likely:
    #    - "Similar boiling points" (B) relates to distillation, for which the jargon is different (e.g., "co-distilling").
    #    - "Similar optical rotations" (D) is a property of chiral compounds and not the basis for this common separation problem.
    #    - "Non-covalent interactions" (A) is too general; it's the underlying principle of polarity, but "similar polarities" is the direct, practical cause of the failed separation.

    # Based on the reasoning, the most likely correct answer is C.
    correct_answer = "C"

            "D": "This option is incorrect because 'similar optical rotations' is a property of chiral compounds measured by a polarimeter and is not the principle behind the most common separation techniques where this phrase is used."
