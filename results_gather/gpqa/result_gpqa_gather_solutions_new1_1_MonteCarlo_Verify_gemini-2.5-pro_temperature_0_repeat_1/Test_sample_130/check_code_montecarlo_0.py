    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry problem.

    The problem involves a Diels-Alder reaction and subsequent NOESY NMR analysis.
    The core of the problem is to determine the stereochemistry of the major product
    and then identify which protons are close in space.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Identify the reactants: Maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.
    2.  Identify the reaction: A Diels-Alder cycloaddition, producing endo and exo adducts.
    3.  Determine the major product: The standard "endo rule" is based on electronic effects. However, it can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky due to four methyl groups. This steric clash destabilizes the endo transition state, making the less-hindered EXO adduct the major kinetic product.
    4.  Assign NMR signals: Based on typical chemical shifts, assign the signals given in the options to the specific protons in the product structure.
        - ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet): Anhydride protons (H_anhydride)
        - ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet): Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinylic)
        - ~1.0 ppm (6H singlet): Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead)
        - ~1.5 ppm (1H doublet): A C7 bridge proton (H_bridge)
    5.  Analyze spatial proximity (NOESY):
        - In the EXO (major) product, the anhydride protons are on the 'endo' face of the bicyclic system, close to the vinylic methyl groups. A NOESY cross-peak is expected.
        - In the ENDO (minor) product, the anhydride protons are on the 'exo' face, far from the vinylic methyl groups. This cross-peak would be absent.
    6.  Conclude: The cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor one must connect the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. This corresponds to the interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.
    7.  Compare with the given options to find the correct answer letter.
