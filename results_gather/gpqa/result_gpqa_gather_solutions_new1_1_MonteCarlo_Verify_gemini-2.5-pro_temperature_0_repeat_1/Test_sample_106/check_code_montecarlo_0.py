    Checks the correctness of the selected answer for the drug discovery question.

    The function models the drug discovery workflow and constraints to determine the most crucial step.
    1.  **Workflow Sequencing**: ADME/PK studies are downstream of target binding.
    2.  **Handling Complexity**: The approach must address the molecule's multiple isomers/tautomers, not oversimplify.
    3.  **Risk Mitigation**: Integrating experimental data is more crucial for de-risking than purely predictive methods.
