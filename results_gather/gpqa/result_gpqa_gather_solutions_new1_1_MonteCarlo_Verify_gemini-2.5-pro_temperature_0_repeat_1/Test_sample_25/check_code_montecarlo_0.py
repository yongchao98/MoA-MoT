    # The reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition between cyclohexene and a ketene.
    # The product, 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one, requires the ketene to be
    # diiodoketene (I2C=C=O).

    # --- Constraint 2: Reactivity Order of Dienes B ---
    # The reactivity in Diels-Alder reactions (most to least reactive) is determined by:
    # 1. Ability to form the s-cis conformation.
    # 2. Electronic effects (electron-donating groups increase reactivity).
    # - (3) cyclopenta-1,3-diene: Locked s-cis, most reactive.
    # - (1) 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene: Strong electron-donating groups, easily forms s-cis.
    # - (2) (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene: Can form s-cis, but less activated than (1).
    # - (4) (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene: Severe steric hindrance prevents s-cis formation, least reactive.
