Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

1.  **Analyze the Reaction Type and Starting Material:**
    *   The question describes an "enamine reaction" and provides reagents typical for the Stork enamine alkylation.
    *   The starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium ion, which is a key intermediate in this reaction type. It is derived from the 5-carbon ketone **pentan-2-one**.
    *   The goal of the reaction is to add an alkyl group to a carbon atom adjacent (alpha, or α) to the original carbonyl carbon.

2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Determine the Correct Sequence (A):**
    *   The reaction is a multi-step synthesis. The order in which reagents are added is critical.
    *   **(i) LDA, DME:** LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Its purpose is to remove a proton from an α-carbon to create a nucleophile (an enamine). DME is the solvent. This must be the first step.
    *   **(ii) CH3CH2I:** Ethyl iodide is an electrophile. It is attacked by the nucleophile created in the first step, adding a two-carbon ethyl group to the molecule. This must be the second step.
    *   **(iii) H3O+:** Aqueous acid is used for the workup. Its purpose is to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone. This must be the final step.
    *   **Conclusion on Sequence:** The only chemically logical sequence is the stepwise addition: 1st Base -> 2nd Alkylating Agent -> 3rd Acid Workup. Any option that mixes these steps (e.g., adding the acid and the alkylating agent together) is incorrect.
    *   Looking at the options provided:
        *   Options B and C show the correct, stepwise sequence: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`.
        *   Options A and D show an incorrect sequence where the acid (H3O+) is mixed with the alkylating agent in the second step. This would cause the reaction to fail.
    *   Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D.

3.  **Predict the Final Product (B):**
    *   The reaction is an α-alkylation. We start with a 5-carbon skeleton (from pentan-2-one) and add a 2-carbon ethyl group (from ethyl iodide). The final product must be a 7-carbon ketone (a heptanone).
    *   **Regioselectivity:** Pentan-2-one has two different α-carbons: C1 (a methyl group) and C3 (a methylene group). LDA is a sterically bulky base, so it preferentially removes a proton from the less hindered C1 position (this is called kinetic control).
    *   **Mechanism:**
        1.  LDA deprotonates C1.
        2.  The resulting nucleophile attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to C1.
        3.  Hydrolysis converts the intermediate back to a ketone.
    *   The resulting structure is `CH3CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`.
    *   **Naming the Product:** This is a 7-carbon chain with the carbonyl at position 4. The name is **heptan-4-one**.
    *   Now we evaluate the remaining options (B and C) based on the product:
        *   Option B lists the product as `heptan-4-one`. This matches our prediction.
        *   Option C lists the product as `pentan-2-one`, which is the starting material. This implies no alkylation occurred, which is incorrect.
    *   Therefore, we can eliminate option C.

4.  **Final Conclusion:**
    *   Option B is the only choice that presents both a chemically correct sequence of reagents and the correct final product.
