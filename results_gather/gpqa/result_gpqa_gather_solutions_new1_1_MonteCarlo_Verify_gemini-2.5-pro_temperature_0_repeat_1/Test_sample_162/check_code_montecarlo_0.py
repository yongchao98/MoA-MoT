def check_chemistry_solution():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected answer for the chemistry problem.

    The logic is to perform a self-consistency check on the chosen option.
    The total moles of H+ added must equal the sum of moles needed for the
    stoichiometric reaction and the moles needed to remain in solution to
    create the final pH. From this total mole requirement, we can calculate
    the necessary volume of acid and compare it to the volume given in the option.
