    Checks the correctness of the answer to the epoxide ring-opening question.

    The function follows these logical steps:
    1.  Determines the correct product skeleton based on regioselectivity rules.
    2.  Determines the correct product stereochemistry based on stereoselectivity rules (SN2 inversion)
        and a rigorous 3D analysis.
    3.  Compares the derived correct product with the provided answer.

    # --- Step 1: Check Regioselectivity and Product Skeleton ---
    # The rule is that the nucleophile (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.
    # The epoxide is between C1 and C6.
    # C1 is quaternary (bonded to a methyl group), making it more hindered.
    # C6 is tertiary (bonded to a hydrogen), making it less hindered.
    # Conclusion: Attack occurs at C6.
    
    # This attack pattern results in a product skeleton of "1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol".
    # (The -OH is on the original C1, which becomes the new C1. The new methyl is on the original C6, which becomes the new C2).

    # --- Step 2: Check Stereochemistry ---
    # The reaction is an SN2 attack, causing inversion of geometry at the attacked center (C6).
    
    # 2a. Model the reactant (1R,3R,4R,6S):
    # To have a (6S) configuration, the epoxide must be 'up' (beta face) and the H at C6 must be 'down' (alpha face).
    # (Verification: Looking down the C6-H bond, the priorities O > C1 > C5 are counter-clockwise -> S. This is correct.)
    
    # 2b. Model the attack:
    # The C6-O bond is 'up' (beta).
    # A backside attack means the nucleophile (Me-) must approach from the 'down' (alpha) side.
    
    # 2c. Model the resulting geometry at the new C2 (originally C6):
    # The new methyl group is added to the 'down' (alpha) face.
    # The original H at C6 is pushed to the 'up' (beta) face.
    
    # 2d. Assign the R/S descriptor for the new C2:
    # The substituents are: C1(with OH), C3(ring CH2), the new Methyl, and H.
    # The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities are: C1(OH) > C3 > Methyl > H.
    # The lowest priority group (H) is 'up' (pointing towards the viewer).
    # The path from priority 1 (C1) -> 2 (C3) -> 3 (Me) is clockwise (R).
    # Since the lowest priority group is towards the viewer, the configuration is the reverse of what is observed.
    # Therefore, the configuration at the new C2 is (S).
    
    # 2e. Determine the configuration of other centers:
    # The other centers (C1, C3, C4) are not attacked and retain their configuration.
    # Old C1 (R) -> New C1 (R).
    # Old C3 (R) -> New C5 (R).
    # Old C4 (R) -> New C4 (R).
    
    # 2f. Assemble the final predicted product name:
    predicted_stereochem = "(1R,2S,4R,5R)"
    predicted_product_name = f"{predicted_stereochem}-{correct_skeleton}"
