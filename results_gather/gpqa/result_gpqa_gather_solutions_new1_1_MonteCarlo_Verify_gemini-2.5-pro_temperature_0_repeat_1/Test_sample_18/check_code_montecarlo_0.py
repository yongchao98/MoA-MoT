    # This is a beta-keto ester. The most acidic proton is on the carbon between the two
    # carbonyl groups (the C1 position). Therefore, the nucleophilic enolate forms at C1,
    # and the subsequent Michael addition must result in a new bond at this C1 position.
    # A product name indicating substitution at C1 (e.g., "1-...") is correct, while
    # substitution at C3 is incorrect.

    # ('ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate') is preserved in the final product. The product should therefore

    # (a 1,4-dicarbonyl system) and would not be formed from this reaction.
