Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.

### Step 1: Identify the Core Physics Concept
The question concerns the hypothetical existence of magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) and their effect on Maxwell's equations. A magnetic monopole would be a "magnetic charge," analogous to an electric charge.

### Step 2: Analyze the Standard Maxwell's Equations
To understand what would change, we must first understand the standard equations and what they represent.
1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀):** Relates the divergence of the electric field to electric charge density. It describes how electric charges are sources of the electric field.
2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** States that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. This is the explicit mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles.
3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** Relates the curl (circulation) of the electric field to a changing magnetic field.
4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law (∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t)):** Relates the curl (circulation) of the magnetic field to electric currents and changing electric fields.

### Step 3: Determine the Necessary Modifications
If magnetic monopoles existed, they would introduce new physical phenomena that the equations must account for.

*   **Careful Point 1: Magnetic Charges as Sources.** A magnetic monopole would be a source (or sink) for the magnetic field, just as an electric charge is for the electric field. Therefore, the divergence of the magnetic field could no longer be zero. Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0) would have to be modified to include a magnetic charge density term. This affects the equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field**.

*   **Careful Point 2: Magnetic Currents.** If magnetic monopoles can move, they would constitute a "magnetic current." In the standard equations, an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field (Ampère-Maxwell Law). To maintain the symmetry of electromagnetism, a magnetic current would have to create a circulating electric field. This requires adding a magnetic current term to Faraday's Law of Induction. This affects the equation for the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis
The two equations that must change are:
1.  The one related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** (Gauss's Law for Magnetism).
2.  The one related to the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law of Induction).

Let's check the options:
*   A) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. — *Incorrect. The curl of the magnetic field (Ampère-Maxwell Law) is not modified.*
*   B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. — **Correct. This perfectly matches our analysis.**
*   C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. — *Incorrect. Neither of these is modified.*
*   D) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. — *Incomplete. While true, Faraday's Law also changes, and option B is more comprehensive.*

### Step 5: Synthesize with Candidate Answers
A review of the provided answers shows that nearly all of them (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14) correctly identify the two physical laws that would change. However, several of them make a simple error in mapping their correct reasoning to the final lettered choice (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13 incorrectly conclude A or C despite their reasoning pointing to B). The answers that correctly perform both the physical analysis and the mapping to the options (e.g., 6, 7, 9, 10, 14) all converge on B.

The consensus of correct reasoning points unequivocally to option B.
