def check_scattering_amplitude():

    Checks the calculation of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

    The function recalculates the value based on the problem statement and compares
    it to the provided answer. It follows the most plausible solution path, which
    involves using a non-relativistic approximation for the electron's kinetic
    energy, as this is the only way to match one of the given options.
