def check_chemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the multi-step synthesis problem.

    This function establishes three key constraints based on the reaction sequence:
    1. The final product must have 3 methyl groups.
    2. The final product must be an 'octahydro' derivative due to elimination.
    3. The final product must have a rearranged skeleton (ideally a [5,5,5] pentalene system)
       due to the relief of ring strain.

    It then filters the given options against these constraints to find the correct answer
    and compares it with the provided answer.
