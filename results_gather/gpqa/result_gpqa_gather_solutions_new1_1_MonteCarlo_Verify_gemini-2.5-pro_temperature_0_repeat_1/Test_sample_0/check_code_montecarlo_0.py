    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum resolution problem.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2, which is approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

    To "clearly resolve" two energy levels, the energy difference between them
    must be greater than their combined energy widths (a criterion analogous
    to the Rayleigh criterion in optics).
