    # Principle 1: Cyanohydrin Formation (Reaction 1)
    # The reaction `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile` is a cyanohydrin formation.
    # The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by CN- followed by protonation of the alkoxide intermediate.
    # Reagent 'A' must be a proton source.
    # 'H3O+' represents an acidic workup, which is a standard proton source.
    # 'NaHSO3' is used for bisulfite addition, a different reaction.

    # Principle 2: Nitrile Hydrolysis (Reaction 2)
    # The reaction `...nitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...carboxylic acid` is a nitrile hydrolysis.
    # This reaction requires vigorous conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or base.
    # Reagent 'B' is the catalyst.
    # 'HCl' is a strong acid and a standard, effective catalyst for this transformation.
    # 'CH3COOH' is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough for complete hydrolysis.
