    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to a multi-step organic chemistry problem.
    It does this by:
    1. Defining the products of the reaction sequence based on standard organic chemistry rules.
    2. Evaluating each of the four statements about these products based on known chemical facts.
    3. Identifying which statement is factually incorrect or misleading.
    4. Comparing this finding with the provided answer.

    # A) C is a flammable gas.
    # B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
    # C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
    # D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

    # The provided answer to check is 'D'.

    # Statement B: "D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra."
    # Compound D is mesitylene. Due to its high symmetry, there are only two types of protons:
    # 1. The 3 equivalent aromatic protons.
    # 2. The 9 equivalent methyl protons.

    # A POSITIVE test gives a distinct color like violet, blue, or green.
    # A NEGATIVE test shows no color change, leaving the solution with the yellow color of the FeCl3 reagent.
    # Due to steric hindrance from the two ortho-methyl groups, compound H gives a NEGATIVE test.
    # The statement is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow color,
    # which is not the case. It describes a negative result. In the context of identifying an incorrect statement,
    # this is the intended one.
