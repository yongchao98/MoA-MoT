    Checks the correctness of the answer for the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.
    
    The function verifies the calculation based on established physical laws:
    1. Equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to a^(-1/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    2. Kepler's Third Law states P^2 is proportional to a^3, so a is proportional to P^(2/3).
    3. Combining these, T_eq is proportional to P^(-1/3).
    4. The ratio T4/T2 is therefore (P4/P2)^(-1/3), which is equivalent to (P2/P4)^(1/3).
