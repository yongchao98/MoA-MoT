**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question**

The question asks for the set of assumptions that jointly define the "impulse approximation" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to treat the interaction of a probe with a nucleus as a sum of interactions with individual nucleons, where each nucleon behaves as if it were free during the brief moment of interaction.

1.  **Analyze Assumption 1: "The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons."**
    *   This is the foundational principle of the impulse approximation. It simplifies the complex A-body problem into a sum of one-body problems. It explicitly neglects phenomena where the probe interacts with multiple nucleons at once (e.g., meson-exchange currents). Without this assumption, one cannot even begin to treat the interaction as a collision with a single "selected" nucleon.
    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential.

2.  **Analyze Assumption 2: "The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon."**
    *   This assumption addresses the environment of the interaction. For a nucleon to behave as if it were truly "free," it must be isolated from the influence of the other nucleons. This assumption means that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) interact with the other "spectator" nucleons. This is known as neglecting initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI).
    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential for the simple "free nucleon" picture to hold.

3.  **Analyze Assumption 3: "The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic."**
    *   This assumption deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nuclear medium. The impulse approximation is a framework that treats nucleons as the fundamental particles. The properties of the nucleon (like its form factors) are inputs to this framework, and these properties can be calculated from models that may or may not treat quarks as relativistic. The validity of the impulse approximation itself does not depend on the internal dynamics of the nucleon's constituents.
    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.

4.  **Analyze Assumption 4: "The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces."**
    *   This is the "impulse" part of the approximation's name. It is a "sudden approximation" that assumes the interaction happens so quickly that the binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus are negligible *during* the collision. The energy and momentum transfer are assumed to be much larger than the nucleon's binding energy. This is what allows the nucleon's dynamics at the moment of interaction to be treated as those of a free particle.
    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential.

**Synthesis and Final Decision**

The impulse approximation is defined by a set of three core ideas:
*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Assumption 1).
*   The surrounding nuclear environment does not interfere (Assumption 2).
*   The nucleon is unbound during the brief interaction (Assumption 4).

Therefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while many of them select an incorrect final letter, the reasoning provided in almost every case correctly identifies assumptions 1, 2, and 4 as the necessary components. The two answers (10 and 12) that are internally consistent both arrive at option C.
