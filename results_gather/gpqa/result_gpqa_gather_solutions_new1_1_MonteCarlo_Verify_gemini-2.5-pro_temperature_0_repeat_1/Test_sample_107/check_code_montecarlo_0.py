def check_correctness_of_physics_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem.
    It calculates the two energies in question and compares their magnitudes.

    1.  Transition Energy (ΔE): Calculated from the given wavelength (λ) using the
        Planck-Einstein relation, ΔE = hc/λ.
    2.  Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (⟨H⟩): Calculated from the given magnetic field (B)
        and a small orbital magnetic quantum number (m), using the Zeeman effect
        formula, ⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B.

    The function then compares the two energies to verify the relationship ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE,
    which corresponds to the provided answer 'B'.
