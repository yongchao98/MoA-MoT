    **Question**:
    Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

    The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

    A) 2
    B) 1
    C) 6
    D) 3

    Based on an analysis of the provided answers and the underlying physics principles, here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Key Information:** The provided expression is `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. The goal is to determine the number of loops, `L`, in the Feynman diagram this expression represents.

    2.  **Isolate the Loop-Dependent Factor:** In quantum field theory calculations, different parts of the expression correspond to different features of the diagram:
        *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: Powers of coupling constants, related to the number of interaction vertices.
        *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: Numerical factors arising from symmetries, group theory, or algebraic traces.
        *   `(Q/M)^2`: A kinematic factor, representing a ratio of energy scales.
        *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This factor is characteristic of the integration over loop momenta. This is the key to solving the problem.

    3.  **Apply the Loop Counting Rule:** In a quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram requires an integration over an unconstrained four-momentum. Standard calculation techniques (like dimensional regularization) show that each such loop integration contributes a factor of `1/(4π)²` to the final amplitude.
        *   For 1 loop, the factor is `1/(4π)²`.
        *   For `L` loops, the combined factor is `(1/(4π)²)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.

    4.  **Formulate and Solve the Equation:** We can equate the general formula with the specific factor found in the expression:
        `1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`

        By comparing the exponents in the denominator, we get:
        `2L = 6`

        Solving for `L` yields:
        `L = 3`

        Therefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.

    ### Careful Points and Consistency Check

    *   **Universality of the Loop Factor:** The `1/(4π)²` factor per loop is a standard and robust result for theories in 4D spacetime. While one could invent a theory with non-standard conventions where couplings absorb this factor, assuming standard practice is the most logical approach.
    *   **Consistency with Vertices:** The term `alpha^3 * g^2` suggests the diagram has a total of `V = 3 + 2 = 5` vertices. The topological relationship between loops (`L`), internal lines (`I`), and vertices (`V`) is `L = I - V + 1`. Plugging in our result `L=3` and `V=5`, we get `3 = I - 5 + 1`, which implies `I = 7`. A diagram with 3 loops, 5 vertices, and 7 internal lines is a valid topological structure, making our result consistent with the other information in the expression.
    *   **Mapping to the Correct Option:** The calculated number of loops is 3. The provided options are A) 2, B) 1, C) 6, and D) 3. The correct option is D. Many of the candidate answers correctly derived `L=3` but failed to select the corresponding option letter.

    The overwhelming consensus from the reasoning in all provided answers is that the number of loops is 3.
