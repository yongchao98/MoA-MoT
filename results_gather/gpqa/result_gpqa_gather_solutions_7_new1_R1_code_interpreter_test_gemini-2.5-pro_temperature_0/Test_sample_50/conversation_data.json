Let's break down the steps and identify the correct formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Method of Images:** The core principle is to simplify the problem by replacing the grounded conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`). This image charge, along with the original charge (`q`), must create a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), which is the boundary condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge Properties:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   **Image Charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Image Position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common pitfall is to calculate the simple interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the potential energy of a charge in the presence of an induced charge on a conductor is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent charge; its existence and magnitude depend on the real charge `q`. The work done to build the entire system is half the interaction energy.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Induced Potential (`V_induced`):**\n    The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation:**\n    Now, substitute `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This is the correct formula.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect, has `d` instead of `R` and a `+` sign in the denominator.\n\nThe correct answer is C. The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the physics but get confused by inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options. The physical derivation consistently points to the formula in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the **Method of Images**.\n\n### Step 1: The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the grounded sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (`V=0`).\n\nFor a charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` has the following properties:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** It is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common pitfall is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'` as if they were two fixed charges. The correct formula includes a factor of 1/2 because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not fixed but is created by the presence of the real charge `q`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy `U` is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Formula\n\n1.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q`:**\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `distance = d - b`.\n    *   `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential at `q`'s location due to `q'` is `V_induced = k * q' / distance`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `distance`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the final potential energy `U`:**\n    *   Substitute `V_induced` into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 4: Comparison with Options and Conclusion\n\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the provided options:\n*   A) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`: Incorrect. It is missing the factor of 1/2 and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   B) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`: Incorrect. It has `R^2` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   C) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`: Incorrect. It has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator and an incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   D) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`: **Correct.** This expression exactly matches our derived formula.\n\nThe majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the physics but several fail to match their result to the correct option letter from the original prompt. Based on a rigorous step-by-step derivation, the correct formula corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the reasoning provided by the multiple agents. I will identify the core physical principle and the mathematical derivation that should be used to solve the problem. It appears the agents all use the \"method of images,\" but arrive at different lettered choices. This suggests the main point of confusion is how the final derived formula maps to the specific options (A, B, C, D), which may have been presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nTherefore, my step-by-step process will be:\n1.  Briefly re-derive the correct formula for the potential energy using the method of images, paying close attention to all factors and variables. This will establish a ground truth for the correct physical answer.\n2.  Carefully compare this derived formula against the specific list of options (A, B, C, D) provided in the original question.\n3.  Identify the single correct letter corresponding to the derived formula from the provided list.\n4.  Write a Python script that programmatically performs this comparison and prints the final correct choice.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\nThe problem of a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n\n**2. Image Charge and Position**\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are:\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position. This can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of `1/2` is crucial because the induced charge is created by `q` itself.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n*   The potential from the image charge is `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `d-b`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Energy Calculation**\nNow, substitute `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\nThe correctly derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this to the options provided in the prompt:\n*   A) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`.\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct.** This matches our derived formula.\n*   C) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect. Wrong variable in numerator and wrong sign in denominator.\n*   D) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Has `R^2` instead of `R`.\n\nThe analysis shows that all agents correctly derived the physics, but the discrepancy in their final answers (A, C, D) is due to them referencing differently ordered lists of options.

The correct derivation leads unambiguously to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physics Principle\nThe problem involves a point charge near a conductor. This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most efficiently solved using the **Method of Images**. The goal of this method is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a simple, fictitious \"image charge\" that replicates the electric field and potential outside the conductor.\n\n### 2. Define the Image Charge and its Properties\nFor a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the method of images provides the following for the image charge `q'`:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\nThis specific choice of `q'` and `b` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, which is the required boundary condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force from the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nA common and direct way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere:\n*   `U` is the total potential energy of the system.\n*   `q` is the real charge.\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution (and thus the potential it creates) is not independent but is itself created by the presence of `q`. Simply using `U = qV` would double-count the energy stored in the field.\n\n### 4. Calculate `V_induced`\nAccording to the method of images, `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is:\n    `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n*   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n*   **Derived Result:** `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect. Numerator has `d`, denominator has `+`.\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct.** This matches our derived formula exactly.\n*   C) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Numerator has `R^2`.\n*   D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nThe correct formula for the net potential energy of the system is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The most effective way to solve this is the **method of images**. This method replaces the sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. This simplified system of two point charges (`q` and `q'`) correctly reproduces the electric field and potential outside the original sphere's volume.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\nThese values are chosen specifically to ensure the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThis is the most critical step where errors can occur. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to calculate the simple interaction energy between the two point charges `q` and `q'`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent charge; its very existence and magnitude depend on the presence of the real charge `q`. Calculating the work done to build up this system leads to this factor of 1/2.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Calculation\n1.  First, we find `V_induced`. According to the method of images, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n2.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `distance = d - b`.\n3.  Substitute the value of `b`: `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n4.  Now, calculate the potential `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n5.  The `d` in the numerator's denominator cancels with the `d` in the denominator's denominator, simplifying the expression to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n6.  Finally, substitute this potential into the correct energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.

The charge is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Method of Solution**: The most effective way to solve this problem is the **method of images**. This technique replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the grounded sphere is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    These values ensure that the potential created by `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`).\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This can be calculated in two primary ways:\n    *   **Integrating the force**: One can calculate the force between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` as a function of distance and integrate from infinity to `d`. This method, performed correctly in candidate answer 13, yields the correct result.\n    *   **Using the potential**: A more direct method uses the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n4.  **The Crucial Factor of 1/2**: The factor of `1/2` is essential and a common point of error. It is required because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent charge. Its existence and magnitude depend on the presence of the real charge `q`. The energy is stored in the field created by the entire system, and simply using `U = qV` would double-count the interaction energy. Nearly all candidate answers correctly identify and justify this factor.\n\n5.  **Derivation using the Potential Method**:\n    *   First, we find `V_induced`. By the method of images, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential is `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Finally, we calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. All provided candidate answers that perform a full derivation arrive at this same mathematical expression, demonstrating a strong consensus on the physics.\n\nNow, we compare this correct formula to the options given in the question:\n*   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, contains R².\n*   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, missing the factor of 1/2 and has `d` in the numerator instead of `R`.\n*   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **This matches the derived result.**\n*   D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect, has `d` instead of `R` and `d² + R²` in the denominator.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Principle: Method of Images\nThe problem involves a point charge near a conductor with a simple geometry (a sphere). This is a classic scenario for the **method of images**. The core idea is to replace the grounded conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are then correctly described by the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The key boundary condition that must be met is that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, as it is grounded.\n\n### 2. Image Charge and Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. There are two reliable methods to calculate this.\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by the electric field as the charge moves from infinity to `d`. The force on `q` at any distance `x` is the force from its image at that moment. This method, while correct, involves integration.\n\n**Method B: Using the Potential (More Direct)**\nA more straightforward method uses the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of an induced charge distribution:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The factor of 1/2.** This factor is crucial. It is present because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent source of potential. Its very existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. Calculating the work done to assemble the system leads to this factor of 1/2, effectively preventing the double-counting of interaction energy.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Derivation using Method B\n1.  **Find the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q`:**\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `distance = d - b`.\n    *   Substitute `b = R^2/d`: `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential from the image charge is `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `distance`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n2.  **Simplify the expression for `V_induced`:**\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n    *   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the final potential energy `U`:**\n    *   Substitute `V_induced` into the energy formula: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\nLet's compare the derived result with the given options:\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator (`d` instead of `R`) and denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n*   B) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect numerator (`R^2` instead of `R`).\n*   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the crucial factor of 1/2 and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   D) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This exactly matches our derived result.**\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most used the correct physical principles, several made errors when matching their derived formula to the lettered options. The correct derivation consistently yields the formula presented in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that is solved using the method of images. All candidate answers correctly identify this method and follow a similar derivation. The key is to ensure every step is correct and then match the final result to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model (Method of Images):**\n    The problem involves a point charge and a simple conductor (a sphere). The method of images is the standard and most efficient way to solve this. This involves replacing the grounded conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a position `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n2.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    For a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center, the image charge and its position are standard results:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position from the center: `b = R^2 / d`\n    All candidate answers correctly state these formulas.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    This is the most critical step where errors can be made. The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This can be calculated in two ways:\n    *   **Integrating the force:** `U = -∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`. This is a valid method.\n    *   **Using the potential:** `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. This is a more direct method.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: The Factor of 1/2:**\n    It is crucial to include the factor of `1/2`. The potential energy is **not** simply `q * V_induced`. The `1/2` is necessary because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, pre-existing charge distribution. It is created by the presence of `q`, and the work done to build the entire system is half the interaction energy of the final charge `q` in the potential of the final induced charge. All candidate answers correctly identify this crucial factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (`V_induced`):**\n    `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance) = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   Simplifying this gives: `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute `V_induced` into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Match with Provided Options:**\n    The derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Now we compare this to the options given in the question prompt:\n    *   A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2`.\n    *   B) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct.**\n    *   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`.\n    *   D) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect, has `d` instead of `R` and `+` in the denominator.\n\nThe derivation is consistent across all candidate answers, and the resulting formula matches option B. The discrepancies in the candidates' final answers (A, C, D) arise from them referencing differently ordered lists of options, but their physical reasoning is sound and points to the same formula.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n*   **Method:** The standard and correct method for solving this problem is the \"method of images.\" This involves replacing the grounded sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere.\n\n*   **Image Charge Properties:** For this configuration, the image charge and its position are:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Potential Energy Calculation:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key point, correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, is that the potential energy `U` is **half** the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The formula is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges (which is equivalent to the potential from the image charge `q'`).\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Formula\nLet's re-derive the formula to be certain.\n1.  The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n2.  The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n3.  Substituting `q'` and the distance into the potential formula:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n4.  The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out, simplifying to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Now, we calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3.

This shows a strong consensus on the underlying physics.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** The candidates provide different final letter answers (A, B, C, D). This is because the mapping of the formulas to the letters A, B, C, and D is different in each candidate's prompt. For example, in Answer 2, the correct formula is listed as option D, while in Answer 3, it is listed as option C.\n\n### 4.

The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n*   **Method:** The standard and most efficient way to solve this problem is the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere.

A common pitfall is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'` as if they were two fixed charges. The correct formula accounts for the fact that the induced charge (represented by `q'`) is created by the presence of `q`. The potential energy `U` is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the method of images, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   **Derivation:**\n    1.  First, find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`:\n        `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    2.

Finally, calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 2.

Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physical Problem and Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center. A grounded sphere is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe most effective way to solve this problem is the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere's surface with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude and sign:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThese values are chosen precisely so that the potential from `q` and `q'` sums to zero at any point on the surface `r=R`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThis is the most critical step. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. A common mistake is to calculate the simple interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the potential energy of a charge in the presence of an induced charge on a conductor is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is essential. It arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, pre-existing charge; its very existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. The formula correctly accounts for the energy stored in the electric field of the entire configuration.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Calculation\n1.  First, we find `V_induced`. According to the method of images, `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n2.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n3.  Let's calculate this distance: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n4.  Now, we calculate the potential `V_induced` from the image charge:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Finally, we calculate the total potential energy `U` using the correct formula from Step 3:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Let's compare this with the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)** - This is an exact match.\n*   **B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)** - Incorrect. It is missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   **C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)** - Incorrect. It has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator and an incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   **D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)** - Incorrect. It has `R^2` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Problem and Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n*   **Grounded Sphere:** A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n*   **Induced Charge:** The charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition.\n*   **Method of Images:** This problem is a classic case for the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThis specific configuration of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` creates a potential of zero on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'` as if they were two fixed charges.\n\nThe correct method is to use the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of a conductor:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution (represented by the image charge) is not fixed but is itself created by the presence of the real charge `q`. Calculating the work done to build the system results in this factor.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Calculation\n1.  **Find `V_induced`:** According to the method of images, `V_induced` at the location of `q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential from the image charge is `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\n2.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator's denominator and the denominator's denominator cancels out.\n    *   `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Energy `U`:**\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's match this with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)**\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option A exactly. While many of the provided candidate answers derived the correct formula, several incorrectly matched it to the letter of the option due to using a different or scrambled list of options. The physical derivation is sound and points unambiguously to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Identify the Correct Physical Method\nThe problem involves a point charge near a conductor with a simple, symmetric shape (a sphere). This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most efficiently solved using the **method of images**. This method replaces the conductor and its complex induced surface charge with a fictitious \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge, satisfies the boundary conditions of the problem.\n\n### 2. Define the Image Charge and its Properties\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the method of images provides the following for the image charge `q'`:\n*   **Magnitude and Sign:** The image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n*   **Position:** The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\nThe key boundary condition for a grounded sphere is that its electric potential is zero. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` correctly makes the potential zero on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common pitfall is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'` as if they were two fixed charges. The correct formula accounts for the fact that the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is created by the presence of `q`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy `U` is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Calculation\n*   **Step 4a: Find the distance between the real charge and the image charge.**\n    The distance is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q`.**\n    This potential is caused by the image charge `q'` at the distance calculated in the previous step.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d - b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the final potential energy `U`.**\n    Substitute the expression for `V_induced` into the energy formula from Step 3:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nNow, let's match this result with the provided options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula is an exact match for option B.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nA review of the provided candidate answers shows that while almost all of them perform the correct physical derivation, many make a mistake in the final step by matching their correct formula to the wrong letter option, likely due to reordering the options in their own response.

This represents a strong consensus on the correct physics and derivation.\n\nThe disagreement in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the agents is due to them being presented with differently ordered lists of options.

This suggests the main point of confusion is how the final derived formula maps to the specific options (A, B, C, D), which may have been presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nTherefore, my step-by-step process will be:\n1.  Briefly re-derive the correct formula for the potential energy using the method of images, paying close attention to all factors and variables.

The Method of Images**\nThe problem of a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n\n**2. Image Charge and Position**\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are:\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position. This can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of `1/2` is crucial because the induced charge is created by `q` itself.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n*   The potential from the image charge is `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `d-b`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Energy Calculation**\nNow, substitute `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\nThe correctly derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this to the options provided in the prompt:\n*   A) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`.\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct.** This matches our derived formula.\n*   C) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect.

The correct derivation leads unambiguously to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physics Principle\nThe problem involves a point charge near a conductor. This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most efficiently solved using the **Method of Images**. The goal of this method is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a simple, fictitious \"image charge\" that replicates the electric field and potential outside the conductor.\n\n### 2. Define the Image Charge and its Properties\nFor a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the method of images provides the following for the image charge `q'`:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\nThis specific choice of `q'` and `b` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, which is the required boundary condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force from the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nA common and direct way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere:\n*   `U` is the total potential energy of the system.\n*   `q` is the real charge.\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution (and thus the potential it creates) is not independent but is itself created by the presence of `q`. Simply using `U = qV` would double-count the energy stored in the field.\n\n### 4. Calculate `V_induced`\nAccording to the method of images, `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is:\n    `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n*   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\nLet's compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n*   **Derived Result:** `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect. Numerator has `d`, denominator has `+`.\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct.** This matches our derived formula exactly.\n*   C) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Numerator has `R^2`.\n*   D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nThe correct formula for the net potential energy of the system is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The most effective way to solve this is the **method of images**. This method replaces the sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. This simplified system of two point charges (`q` and `q'`) correctly reproduces the electric field and potential outside the original sphere's volume.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\nThese values are chosen specifically to ensure the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThis is the most critical step where errors can occur. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to calculate the simple interaction energy between the two point charges `q` and `q'`.\n\nThe correct formula for the potential energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent charge; its very existence and magnitude depend on the presence of the real charge `q`. Calculating the work done to build up this system leads to this factor of 1/2.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Calculation\n1.  First, we find `V_induced`. According to the method of images, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n2.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `distance = d - b`.\n3.  Substitute the value of `b`: `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n4.  Now, calculate the potential `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n5.  The `d` in the numerator's denominator cancels with the `d` in the denominator's denominator, simplifying the expression to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n6.  Finally, substitute this potential into the correct energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Let's compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect.\n*   B) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect.\n*   C) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect.\n*   D) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct.**\n\nThe derived result exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Method of Solution**: The most effective way to solve this problem is the **method of images**. This technique replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the grounded sphere is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    These values ensure that the potential created by `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`).\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This can be calculated in two primary ways:\n    *   **Integrating the force**: One can calculate the force between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` as a function of distance and integrate from infinity to `d`. This method, performed correctly in candidate answer 13, yields the correct result.\n    *   **Using the potential**: A more direct method uses the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n4.  **The Crucial Factor of 1/2**: The factor of `1/2` is essential and a common point of error. It is required because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent charge. Its existence and magnitude depend on the presence of the real charge `q`. The energy is stored in the field created by the entire system, and simply using `U = qV` would double-count the interaction energy. Nearly all candidate answers correctly identify and justify this factor.\n\n5.  **Derivation using the Potential Method**:\n    *   First, we find `V_induced`. By the method of images, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential is `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Finally, we calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. All provided candidate answers that perform a full derivation arrive at this same mathematical expression, demonstrating a strong consensus on the physics.\n\nNow, we compare this correct formula to the options given in the question:\n*   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, contains R².\n*   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, missing the factor of 1/2 and has `d` in the numerator instead of `R`.\n*   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **This matches the derived result.**\n*   D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect, has `d` instead of `R` and `d² + R²` in the denominator.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Principle: Method of Images\nThe problem involves a point charge near a conductor with a simple geometry (a sphere). This is a classic scenario for the **method of images**. The core idea is to replace the grounded conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are then correctly described by the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The key boundary condition that must be met is that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, as it is grounded.\n\n### 2. Image Charge and Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. There are two reliable methods to calculate this.\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by the electric field as the charge moves from infinity to `d`. The force on `q` at any distance `x` is the force from its image at that moment. This method, while correct, involves integration.\n\n**Method B: Using the Potential (More Direct)**\nA more straightforward method uses the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of an induced charge distribution:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The factor of 1/2.** This factor is crucial. It is present because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, independent source of potential. Its very existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. Calculating the work done to assemble the system leads to this factor of 1/2, effectively preventing the double-counting of interaction energy.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Derivation using Method B\n1.  **Find the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q`:**\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `distance = d - b`.\n    *   Substitute `b = R^2/d`: `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential from the image charge is `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `distance`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n2.  **Simplify the expression for `V_induced`:**\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n    *   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the final potential energy `U`:**\n    *   Substitute `V_induced` into the energy formula: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\nLet's compare the derived result with the given options:\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator (`d` instead of `R`) and denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n*   B) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect numerator (`R^2` instead of `R`).\n*   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the crucial factor of 1/2 and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   D) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This exactly matches our derived result.**\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most used the correct physical principles, several made errors when matching their derived formula to the lettered options. The correct derivation consistently yields the formula presented in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that is solved using the method of images. All candidate answers correctly identify this method and follow a similar derivation. The key is to ensure every step is correct and then match the final result to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model (Method of Images):**\n    The problem involves a point charge and a simple conductor (a sphere). The method of images is the standard and most efficient way to solve this. This involves replacing the grounded conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a position `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n2.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    For a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center, the image charge and its position are standard results:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position from the center: `b = R^2 / d`\n    All candidate answers correctly state these formulas.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    This is the most critical step where errors can be made. The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This can be calculated in two ways:\n    *   **Integrating the force:** `U = -∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`. This is a valid method.\n    *   **Using the potential:** `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. This is a more direct method.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: The Factor of 1/2:**\n    It is crucial to include the factor of `1/2`. The potential energy is **not** simply `q * V_induced`. The `1/2` is necessary because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, pre-existing charge distribution. It is created by the presence of `q`, and the work done to build the entire system is half the interaction energy of the final charge `q` in the potential of the final induced charge.

In the image method, this is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance) = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   Simplifying this gives: `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute `V_induced` into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Match with Provided Options:**\n    The derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.

The discrepancies in the candidates' final answers (A, C, D) arise from them referencing differently ordered lists of options, but their physical reasoning is sound and points to the same formula.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n*   **Method:** The standard and correct method for solving this problem is the \"method of images.\" This involves replacing the grounded sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere.\n\n*   **Image Charge Properties:** For this configuration, the image charge and its position are:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Potential Energy Calculation:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key point, correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, is that the potential energy `U` is **half** the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The formula is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges (which is equivalent to the potential from the image charge `q'`).\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Formula\nLet's re-derive the formula to be certain.\n1.  The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n2.  The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n3.  Substituting `q'` and the distance into the potential formula:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n4.  The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out, simplifying to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Now, we calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Derivation Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers that perform a derivation arrive at the same correct formula: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This shows a strong consensus on the underlying physics.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** The candidates provide different final letter answers (A, B, C, D). This is because the mapping of the formulas to the letters A, B, C, and D is different in each candidate's prompt. For example, in Answer 2, the correct formula is listed as option D, while in Answer 3, it is listed as option C.\n\n### 4.

Analysis of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n*   **Method:** The standard and most efficient way to solve this problem is the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\n*   **Image Charge and Position:** For this specific geometry, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Potential Energy Calculation:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. A common pitfall is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'` as if they were two fixed charges. The correct formula accounts for the fact that the induced charge (represented by `q'`) is created by the presence of `q`. The potential energy `U` is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the method of images, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   **Derivation:**\n    1.  First, find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`:\n        `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    2.  Next, calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n        The `d` terms cancel out, leaving:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    3.  Finally, calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 2. Comparison with Candidate Answers and Options\n\nThe derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)**\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula perfectly matches **Option A**.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Candidate Agent Responses\n\n*   **Consensus on Physics:** All 15 candidate answers correctly apply the method of images and arrive at the same final formula: `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This shows a strong consensus on the physical derivation.\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choice:** The agents disagree on the final letter (A, B, C, or D). This is because many of them are referencing a shuffled or different list of options than the one provided in the original question. For example, Answer 2 correctly derives the formula but states it matches \"option D\" from its own internal list, where that formula was indeed labeled D.\n*   **Conclusion:** The physical reasoning across all agents is sound and consistent. The confusion lies only in matching the correct formula to the correct letter from the original prompt's list.

Because the induced charge (represented by `q'`) is created by the presence of `q`, the total energy stored in the field is half the interaction energy.\n    *   The correct formula is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   By the method of images, `V_induced` is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (`V_induced`):**\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `distance = d - b`.\n    *   Substitute `b = R^2 / d`: `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential at `q`'s location due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying to:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (`U`):**\n    *   Substitute `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\nA) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect. Missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\nB) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect.

Has `R^2` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly derive the same physical formula, but they disagree on which letter option it corresponds to because they were likely presented with different lists of options. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physical Problem and Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center. A grounded sphere is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe most effective way to solve this problem is the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere's surface with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n*   **Image charge magnitude and sign:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThese values are chosen precisely so that the potential from `q` and `q'` sums to zero at any point on the surface `r=R`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThis is the most critical step. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. A common mistake is to calculate the simple interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the potential energy of a charge in the presence of an induced charge on a conductor is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is essential. It arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not a fixed, pre-existing charge; its very existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. The formula correctly accounts for the energy stored in the electric field of the entire configuration.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Calculation\n1.  First, we find `V_induced`. According to the method of images, `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n2.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n3.  Let's calculate this distance: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n4.  Now, we calculate the potential `V_induced` from the image charge:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying to:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Finally, we calculate the total potential energy `U` using the correct formula from Step 3:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Let's compare this with the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)** - This is an exact match.\n*   **B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)** - Incorrect. It is missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   **C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)** - Incorrect. It has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator and an incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   **D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)** - Incorrect. It has `R^2` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Problem and Method\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n*   **Grounded Sphere:** A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n*   **Induced Charge:** The charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition.\n*   **Method of Images:** This problem is a classic case for the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThis specific configuration of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` creates a potential of zero on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'` as if they were two fixed charges.\n\nThe correct method is to use the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of a conductor:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution (represented by the image charge) is not fixed but is itself created by the presence of the real charge `q`. Calculating the work done to build the system results in this factor.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Calculation\n1.  **Find `V_induced`:** According to the method of images, `V_induced` at the location of `q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential from the image charge is `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\n2.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator's denominator and the denominator's denominator cancels out.\n    *   `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Energy `U`:**\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived formula for the net potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's match this with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)**\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option A exactly.
