Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** The molecule has three adjacent substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. A key challenge is introducing substituents ortho to the bulky tert-butyl group and achieving the specific meta relationship between the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option as written to determine its chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) and (ii) correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an impossible chemical step.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   Steps (i), (ii), and (iii) would produce a nitrated, sulfonated tert-butylbenzene derivative. This molecule does not contain a primary aromatic amine group.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires a primary aromatic amine as the substrate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because it applies a reaction to an inappropriate substrate.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   Steps (i) through (v) could plausibly generate a diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt using HNO₃/H₂SO₄. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. They are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., with H₂O, CuX, HBF₄).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a nonsensical chemical step.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This option presents a sequence of individually plausible reactions, even if the overall yield is questionable. Let's trace the path:\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Standard)\n        2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product, but it is formed.\n        3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard)\n        4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This can direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This step would likely produce a mixture, but it is chemically possible).\n        5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Standard)\n        6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard)\n        7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Standard)\n    *   The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the options that is composed entirely of valid chemical transformations and leads to the correctly named product.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step, rendering them incorrect. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that are all chemically possible and lead to the target molecule. While the claim of \"high-yield\" is questionable due to poor regioselectivity in some steps, it is the only viable synthetic route presented. Therefore, it is the best answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, sterically hindering ortho substitution.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically crowded and electronically complex pattern to synthesize, suggesting a multi-step approach is necessary.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final Steps (Retrosynthesis)**\n\n*   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. A very common and high-yield method to form an aryl ether is the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This involves reacting a phenol with a base and an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is reacting **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol** with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr). This matches step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in option C.\n*   The precursor phenol, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**, can be synthesized from the corresponding primary amine (**2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`). This matches steps `v)` and `vi)` in option C.\n*   This means the core of the problem is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options as Written**\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence begins with a blocking group strategy (`i) t-BuCl`, `ii) SO3/H2SO4`). This blocks the para position of tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent nitration (`iii) HNO3/H2SO4`) is forced to the ortho position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This 1,2,4-substitution pattern cannot be easily converted to the required 1,2,3-pattern of the final product. Therefore, this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with nitration (`i) HNO3/H2SO4`) and reduction (`ii) Fe/HCl`) to form aniline. Step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction is not viable because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Therefore, this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is written in a confusing order and attempts diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) on a substrate that has not yet been converted to an amine. Therefore, this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical plausibility step-by-step.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Plausible)\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer. However, the desired **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** is also formed as a minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would require separating this minor product. (Plausible, but not high-yield)\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Plausible)\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting, but substitution at position 3 (meta to the anilinium and ortho to the t-butyl) is possible, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. (Plausible, but likely gives a mixture of isomers and is not high-yield)\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Plausible)\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Plausible)\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Plausible)\n    *   **viii) & ix):** These final sulfonation/desulfonation steps are extraneous, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps, Option C outlines a sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correct target molecule. The main drawback is that several steps would have low yields due to poor regioselectivity, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition in the prompt. However, among the given choices, it is the only one that represents a valid synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, I will analyze each proposed reaction sequence step-by-step to determine its chemical feasibility and whether it can lead to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key is to consider the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions required for each reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule:**\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents in a 1,2,3-arrangement: -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, ortho/para-directors.\n    *   -NO2 is deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   The 1,2,3-pattern is sterically hindered and often requires a careful strategy to synthesize.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option:**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, NaNO2/HCl) on the product from step (iii).\n    *   Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C has an incorrect reaction order and is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for nitration. This step is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large size of the t-Bu group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would follow this major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **p-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3, which is meta to C1 and ortho to C4). This is a good, regioselective step yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine → **diazonium salt**. (Valid)\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt → **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Valid)\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis → **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are extraneous.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option B describes a completely valid, multi-step synthesis. However, this synthesis produces **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the molecule named in the question. Given that the other three options are fundamentally flawed, it is highly probable that there is a typo in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is often challenging to synthesize.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -NO2 groups are meta to each other, while both are ortho to the -tBu group.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nWe will analyze each proposed sequence for chemical feasibility and its ability to produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) and (ii) correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the alkylation from occurring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because it contains an impossible reaction step.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   Steps (i) through (v) describe a plausible sequence to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates used for replacement reactions (like forming phenols or halides), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. This step is chemically nonsensical.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because it contains an impossible reaction step.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence describes a logical and high-yield synthesis.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is overwhelmingly **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iii) Reduction of the nitro group gives **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The powerful activating amino group (protected as an acetamide in practice) and the t-butyl group both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   The rest of the sequence (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would convert this into **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a high-yield synthesis, but it produces an *isomer* of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it does not lead to the specified product.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze its pathway.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As noted, the major product is the para isomer. To proceed towards the target, we must use the minor **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer. This step immediately violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    *   iii) Reduction of the ortho isomer gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This step allows for the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   v) Diazotization of the amino group.\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While this pathway is plagued by low yields (especially in step ii), it is the only sequence among the options that is chemically plausible and can, in principle, lead to the correctly named target molecule. Options C and D are chemically impossible, and Option B leads to the wrong isomer. By elimination, Option A is the only viable choice, despite the inaccuracy of the \"high-yield\" description in the prompt.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBy eliminating the options that are chemically impossible (C, D) or lead to the wrong product (B), Option A remains as the only sequence that can form the target molecule, even though it would not be a high-yield process.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (position 1), -tBu (position 2), and -NO2 (position 3).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to evaluate each proposed sequence of reactions *as it is written*. A single chemically impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   Steps i-v seem plausible, leading to a diazonium salt.\n    *   Step vi attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4`). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating one with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. It would likely decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   Step i) Nitration and ii) Reduction correctly produce aniline.\n    *   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   Steps i-iii involve adding substituents to the ring.\n    *   Step iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step iii (a nitro-tert-butyl-sulfonic acid) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. However, the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho isomer) is also formed, albeit in a lower yield. For the synthesis to proceed, this minor isomer must be carried forward.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This step can form the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.

(Valid)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed to convert the phenol into the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    8.  **viii) & ix):** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are extraneous and not needed, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible step in the sequence as written. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically plausible, leading from benzene to the final product. While the yield of the first nitration step (ii) would be low for the required ortho isomer, making the overall synthesis not \"high-yield,\" it is the only pathway among the choices that is chemically sound. In a multiple-choice question of this nature, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weak activating ortho, para-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at the ortho position.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivating meta-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The primary challenge is introducing substituents at the correct positions, especially overcoming the steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group and managing the directing effects of all groups.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as written to check for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not viable because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence proceeds until step (v), where a diazonium salt is formed. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or plausible synthetic transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is out of order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, no amine has been formed by this point in the sequence.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish. Let's analyze the pathway:\n        1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 3, which is meta to the anilinium and ortho to the tert-butyl). This is a regioselective step that forms **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n        7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ether product, **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence describes a valid, high-yield synthesis. However, it produces an isomer of the molecule named in the question. Given that options A, C, and D contain fundamentally impossible chemical steps, Option B is the only viable choice. This strongly implies that there is a typo in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and this valid synthetic pathway is the intended answer. The final two steps (viii and ix) are extraneous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on a rigorous chemical analysis, Options A, C, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible or in an illogical order. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically sound and logical series of reactions. Although it leads to an isomer of the named product, it is the only plausible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (or vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents (for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** A key intermediate, strongly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*.\n    *   **-NH3+ (Anilinium):** Forms from an amino group in strong acid, strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nA correct synthetic sequence must consist of chemically valid reactions in a logical order. We will check each option for fatal flaws.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   The sequence lists `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) after several steps, but at that point in the synthesis, no primary aromatic amine has been formed. Diazotization can only be performed on an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect due to an illogical reaction order.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   `iv) Fe/HCl`: Reduction → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization → Diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step attempts to nitrate the highly unstable diazonium salt intermediate. **This is not a standard or viable reaction.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   This is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze the core sequence of transformations it proposes, ignoring the superfluous final steps (viii, ix) for now.\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield but is chemically possible. (Valid)\n    *   `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This allows for the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step, making them invalid synthetic routes. Option A, while involving steps that would result in mixtures and low yields (contradicting the \"high-yield\" premise), is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly structured final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question, it is the only viable answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three groups:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy) at position 1\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl) at position 2\n    *   -NO₂ (nitro) at position 3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu:** Activating, ortho, para-director. Its large size sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n    *   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH₂ (intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NH₃⁺ (intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nWe will evaluate each sequence for chemical feasibility, paying close attention to reaction conditions and directing effects.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly deactivating groups, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring even further. Therefore, this option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used for replacement reactions (like with H₂O, CuX, etc.), not for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, this option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain an immediately obvious impossible step. Let's trace the reaction pathway, assuming we follow the major product at each step to satisfy the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large size of the tert-butyl group, substitution at the para position is heavily favored. The major product is **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 is a meta-director, and the -tBu group at C4 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 and C6). This is a powerful synthetic strategy that leads to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, giving **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps listed in the option (viii and ix) are extraneous, as a stable final product has already been formed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed as they contain chemically impossible steps. Option D describes a logical and chemically sound multi-step synthesis. While this pathway leads to an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the molecule named in the question, it is the only viable reaction sequence among the choices. In such cases, it is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and the option describing the valid synthesis is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully analyze each proposed pathway.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (position 1), -tBu (position 2), and -NO₂ (position 3).\n*   **Key Challenge:** Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene is often difficult. The main hurdles here are:\n    1.  Placing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group. Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene strongly favors the *para* position.\n    2.  Achieving the *meta* relationship between the strongly activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO₂ group.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).

However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material.

This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Although the *para* isomer is the major product, the *ortho* isomer is also formed and is required for this synthesis. We assume it can be separated and carried forward.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of *o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene* is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director.

Detailed Analysis of the Viable Option (Option C)\n\nSince options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps, Option C is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical logic.\n\n**Sequence C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n\n1.  **Step i**: Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n2.  **Step ii**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To achieve the final product, we must proceed with the **ortho isomer**. While this is the minor product, it is a chemically possible intermediate.\n3.  **Step iii**: Reduction of the nitro group in *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard reduction).\n4.  **Step iv**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). Let's analyze the directing effects:\n    *   The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing the incoming -NO₂ to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The -tBu group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the incoming -NO₂ to positions 3 and 6.\n    *   The directing effects of both groups are **cooperative** for position 3. This makes the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** a plausible outcome.\n5.  **Step v**: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Standard reaction).\n6.  **Step vi**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt with heat and aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard reaction).\n7.  **Step vii**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ether with base (NaOH) and an ethyl halide (EtBr), forming the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Standard reaction).\n\nThe final two steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions A, B, and D are chemically impossible. Option C, despite having a low-yield step, represents the only chemically viable pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, and -NO2 at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern. Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Substituent Properties (for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** A common intermediate, strongly activating, ortho/para-director. In strong acid, it becomes the **-NH3+ (anilinium) ion**, which is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will check each proposed sequence for fatal chemical flaws.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) as a blocking group (steps i, ii, iii), which is a valid strategy. However, step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step `v)`. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are not nitrated in this way; they would decompose. This is a fatal flaw in the written sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   This sequence is chemically sound for the most part.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene\n    *   ii) Nitration → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (This is the major product, making this a high-yield step).\n    *   iii) Reduction → p-tert-butylaniline\n    *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the acidic medium, the amine becomes -NH3+ (meta-director) and the t-butyl is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine, yielding 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    *   The rest of the sequence (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) is also valid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a valid synthesis, but it produces **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule. It does not produce the named product.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This sequence begins with nitration, then reduction to aniline.\n    *   Step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's see if it can produce the target molecule.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To make the target, we must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) and separate it from the major para isomer. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    *   iii) Reduction of the nitro group → 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\n    *   iv) Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine becomes the -NH3+ ion (at C1), which is a meta-director. It directs the incoming nitro group to C3. This is a plausible, though potentially low-yield, way to form the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   v) Diazotization of the amino group. (Valid)\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. (Valid)\n    *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core sequence (i-vii) is chemically plausible and is the only one among the options that can lead to the correctly named target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The final two steps (viii, ix) are extraneous, and the synthesis is likely low-yield, but it is the only path that works.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\n*   Options A and C contain fatal flaws (reactions that do not work).\n*   Option B is a valid synthesis but produces the wrong molecule (an isomer).\n*   Option D describes a chemically possible, albeit low-yield, synthesis of the correct target molecule.\n\nIn a multiple-choice question of this type, the sequence that leads to the named product is the intended answer, even if it is not perfectly efficient. Therefore, Option D is the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of the order of reactions, directing effects of substituents, and steric hindrance. The goal is to find the sequence that leads to the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** It has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern with an ethoxy (-OEt), a tert-butyl (-tBu), and a nitro (-NO₂) group.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho, para-director.\n    *   -NO₂: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is very bulky and sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions. A simple electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene (like nitration) would overwhelmingly yield the para-substituted product, not the required ortho-substituted one. A successful high-yield synthesis must overcome this steric hindrance.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Core Synthetic Strategies in the Options\n\nWe must look for a strategy that solves the problem of forcing substitution into the sterically hindered position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Direct Substitution (Low Yield).** This involves adding the tert-butyl group, then nitrating it, and hoping to separate the small amount of the ortho-nitro product that forms. This does not meet the \"high-yield\" criterion. Several options (like B in some interpretations) follow this path, making them less likely to be correct.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Friedel-Crafts on a Deactivated/Reactive Ring.** Some options propose a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (e.g., Option C/D in some analyses). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amine, deactivating the ring. This strategy is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: The Blocking Group Strategy (High Yield).** This is the textbook method to solve this exact problem.\n    1.  Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    2.  Block the sterically accessible *para* position with a reversible group, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H).\n    3.  Perform the next substitution (e.g., nitration). With the *para* position blocked, the reaction is forced to occur at the *ortho* position, overcoming the steric hindrance and leading to a high yield of the desired 1,2-substituted intermediate.\n    4.  The blocking group can be removed later in the synthesis.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Option with the Correct High-Yield Strategy\n\nWe need to find the option that begins with the blocking group strategy. Let's analyze the initial steps of the options as they are most consistently described by the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Option A** is frequently described as starting with:\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` (Adds the t-Bu group)\n    *   `ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` (Adds the blocking group to the para position)\n    *   `iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄` (Nitrates at the ortho position, as para is blocked)\n\nThis sequence perfectly matches the correct high-yield blocking group strategy. While the subsequent steps listed in the full option may be jumbled or contain errors, these initial steps are the only ones presented that can lead to a **high-yield** synthesis of an ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivative. The other options either rely on low-yield separations or contain chemically impossible steps.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the most chemically sound and strategically correct approach to the problem, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is the \"high-yield synthesis\" of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders reactions at adjacent positions.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement is sterically crowded and requires a careful synthetic strategy.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This is a critical constraint. Any proposed pathway that involves steps known to give poor yields (e.g., significant isomer formation that requires difficult separation) should be considered less likely to be correct.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA logical approach is to plan the synthesis in reverse from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most reliable and high-yield method to form this is the Williamson ether synthesis. This requires a phenol as the precursor.\n    *   *Precursor:* 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   *Reagents:* A base like `NaOH` and an ethylating agent like `EtBr`. This set of reagents is present in all options.\n*   **The Core Challenge:** The main problem is the high-yield synthesis of the key intermediate: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options based on the Core Challenge**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences to see if they can produce this key intermediate in high yield.\n\n*   **Option B and D (as analyzed by some candidates):** These options involve a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (or a derivative). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This makes these routes non-viable.\n\n*   **Option D (as written):**\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the extreme steric bulk of the -tBu group, this reaction overwhelmingly produces the *para* isomer (~70-80%) and only a small amount of the *ortho* isomer (~15-20%). To proceed to the target, one must use the minor *ortho* isomer. This step fundamentally violates the \"high-yield\" requirement. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This option starts with a promising \"blocking group\" strategy: `i) tert-butylation`, `ii) sulfonation` (to block the para position), and `iii) nitration` (to force substitution at the ortho position). This is an excellent, high-yield method to create a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate.\n    *   However, the sequence contains a fatal flaw at step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`, which attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable reaction. Therefore, the sequence as written is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   The sequence of reactions as written in Option A is nonsensical and chemically impossible (e.g., step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is diazotization, but the required amine is not formed until step `viii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   However, let's consider the possibility that the question provides the correct *set of reagents* for a valid synthesis, but in a scrambled order. Let's see if a high-yield synthesis is possible using the \"toolkit\" from Option A.\n    *   **A Plausible High-Yield Strategy using Reagents from A:**\n        1.  **Synthesize m-nitrophenol:** This is a standard multi-step process starting from benzene. It requires nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), a second nitration to get m-dinitrobenzene (`HNO3/H2SO4`), selective reduction of one nitro group (`Fe/HCl` could be used), diazotization of the resulting amine (`NaNO2/HCl`), and finally hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to the phenol (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n        2.  **Alkylate m-nitrophenol:** React m-nitrophenol with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. The powerful activating -OH group directs the incoming -tBu group to the ortho/para positions. The position ortho to the -OH and meta to the -NO₂ (position 2) is an electronically favorable position for this reaction, leading to the desired **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        3.  **Etherify:** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether using `NaOH/EtBr`.\n    *   This entire pathway is chemically sound and avoids the low-yield steps of the other options. Option A is the only one that contains the complete set of reagents required for this elegant and plausible high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the sequence in Option A is scrambled, it is the only option that provides the necessary reagents for a viable **high-yield** synthesis of the target molecule. The other options either contain chemically impossible steps or rely on pathways that are inherently low-yield, directly contradicting a key constraint of the question. Therefore, Option A is the best choice, assuming the question's author provided the correct ingredients but in the wrong order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of multi-step organic synthesis, focusing on the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each reaction. The goal is to find a high-yield pathway to **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (position 1), -tBu (position 2), and -NO₂ (position 3).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weak activator, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as written to determine its chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ...`\n    *   This sequence proceeds through several steps to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (like hydrolysis to a phenol, as in step vii).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is written in a chemically illogical order. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary amine. However, the amine is not formed until a much later step (viii, `Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **ii) Nitration:** The bulky t-butyl group directs nitration overwhelmingly to the para position. Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid, high-yield)\n    *   **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   **iv) Nitration:** This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 3 relative to the anilinium ion). Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid strategy)\n    *   **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in water to form a phenol. Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Valid)\n    *   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B outlines a sequence of reactions that are all chemically valid and would proceed in high yield. However, this sequence produces **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the named target molecule.\n\nGiven that three of the four options are fundamentally flawed, Option B is the only plausible choice. This strongly implies that there is a typographical error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and that the valid synthetic pathway described in Option B is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe objective is to identify the correct sequence of reactions for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene. This requires a careful evaluation of each proposed pathway, considering reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director.

Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This is the critical step where the question's constraints conflict.\n            *   To achieve the **named product**, the synthesis must proceed through the minor *ortho*-nitro isomer. This violates the **\"high-yield\"** condition.\n            *   To satisfy the **\"high-yield\"** condition, the synthesis must proceed through the major *para*-nitro isomer, which would lead to a different final product (an isomer of the one named).\n    *   **Resolution:** Options A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed due to impossible chemical steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible. The conflict between the \"high-yield\" descriptor and the final product name indicates a flaw in the question's design.

This molecule does not contain a primary aromatic amine group.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires a primary aromatic amine as the substrate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because it applies a reaction to an inappropriate substrate.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   Steps (i) through (v) could plausibly generate a diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt using HNO₃/H₂SO₄. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. They are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., with H₂O, CuX, HBF₄).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a nonsensical chemical step.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This option presents a sequence of individually plausible reactions, even if the overall yield is questionable. Let's trace the path:\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Standard)\n        2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product, but it is formed.\n        3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard)\n        4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This can direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This step would likely produce a mixture, but it is chemically possible).\n        5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Standard)\n        6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard)\n        7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Standard)\n    *   The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the options that is composed entirely of valid chemical transformations and leads to the correctly named product.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step, rendering them incorrect. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that are all chemically possible and lead to the target molecule. While the claim of \"high-yield\" is questionable due to poor regioselectivity in some steps, it is the only viable synthetic route presented. Therefore, it is the best answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, sterically hindering ortho substitution.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are in a 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement. This is a sterically crowded and electronically complex pattern to synthesize, suggesting a multi-step approach is necessary.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final Steps (Retrosynthesis)**\n\n*   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. A very common and high-yield method to form an aryl ether is the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This involves reacting a phenol with a base and an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is reacting **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol** with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr). This matches step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in option C.\n*   The precursor phenol, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**, can be synthesized from the corresponding primary amine (**2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`). This matches steps `v)` and `vi)` in option C.\n*   This means the core of the problem is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options as Written**\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence begins with a blocking group strategy (`i) t-BuCl`, `ii) SO3/H2SO4`). This blocks the para position of tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent nitration (`iii) HNO3/H2SO4`) is forced to the ortho position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This 1,2,4-substitution pattern cannot be easily converted to the required 1,2,3-pattern of the final product. Therefore, this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with nitration (`i) HNO3/H2SO4`) and reduction (`ii) Fe/HCl`) to form aniline. Step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction is not viable because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Therefore, this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is written in a confusing order and attempts diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) on a substrate that has not yet been converted to an amine. Therefore, this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical plausibility step-by-step.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Plausible)\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer. However, the desired **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** is also formed as a minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would require separating this minor product. (Plausible, but not high-yield)\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Plausible)\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting, but substitution at position 3 (meta to the anilinium and ortho to the t-butyl) is possible, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. (Plausible, but likely gives a mixture of isomers and is not high-yield)\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Plausible)\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Plausible)\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Plausible)\n    *   **viii) & ix):** These final sulfonation/desulfonation steps are extraneous, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps, Option C outlines a sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correct target molecule. The main drawback is that several steps would have low yields due to poor regioselectivity, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition in the prompt. However, among the given choices, it is the only one that represents a valid synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, I will analyze each proposed reaction sequence step-by-step to determine its chemical feasibility and whether it can lead to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key is to consider the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions required for each reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule:**\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents in a 1,2,3-arrangement: -OEt (ethoxy) at C1, -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, ortho/para-directors.\n    *   -NO2 is deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   The 1,2,3-pattern is sterically hindered and often requires a careful strategy to synthesize.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option:**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, NaNO2/HCl) on the product from step (iii).\n    *   Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C has an incorrect reaction order and is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for nitration. This step is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large size of the t-Bu group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would follow this major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **p-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3, which is meta to C1 and ortho to C4). This is a good, regioselective step yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine → **diazonium salt**. (Valid)\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt → **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Valid)\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis → **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are extraneous.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option B describes a completely valid, multi-step synthesis. However, this synthesis produces **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the molecule named in the question. Given that the other three options are fundamentally flawed, it is highly probable that there is a typo in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt.

This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step iii (a nitro-tert-butyl-sulfonic acid) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. However, the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho isomer) is also formed, albeit in a lower yield. For the synthesis to proceed, this minor isomer must be carried forward.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (and 5). This step can form the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.

(Valid)\n    8.  **viii) & ix):** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are extraneous and not needed, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible step in the sequence as written. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically plausible, leading from benzene to the final product. While the yield of the first nitration step (ii) would be low for the required ortho isomer, making the overall synthesis not \"high-yield,\" it is the only pathway among the choices that is chemically sound. In a multiple-choice question of this nature, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weak activating ortho, para-director.

Let's analyze the pathway:\n        1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 3, which is meta to the anilinium and ortho to the tert-butyl). This is a regioselective step that forms **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n        7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ether product, **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence describes a valid, high-yield synthesis. However, it produces an isomer of the molecule named in the question. Given that options A, C, and D contain fundamentally impossible chemical steps, Option B is the only viable choice. This strongly implies that there is a typo in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and this valid synthetic pathway is the intended answer. The final two steps (viii and ix) are extraneous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on a rigorous chemical analysis, Options A, C, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible or in an illogical order. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically sound and logical series of reactions. Although it leads to an isomer of the named product, it is the only plausible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (or vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents (for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** A key intermediate, strongly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*.\n    *   **-NH3+ (Anilinium):** Forms from an amino group in strong acid, strongly deactivating, directs *meta*.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nA correct synthetic sequence must consist of chemically valid reactions in a logical order. We will check each option for fatal flaws.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   The sequence lists `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) after several steps, but at that point in the synthesis, no primary aromatic amine has been formed. Diazotization can only be performed on an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect due to an illogical reaction order.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   `iv) Fe/HCl`: Reduction → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization → Diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step attempts to nitrate the highly unstable diazonium salt intermediate. **This is not a standard or viable reaction.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   This is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze the core sequence of transformations it proposes, ignoring the superfluous final steps (viii, ix) for now.\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield but is chemically possible. (Valid)\n    *   `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This allows for the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.

(Valid)\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step, making them invalid synthetic routes. Option A, while involving steps that would result in mixtures and low yields (contradicting the \"high-yield\" premise), is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly structured final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question, it is the only viable answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three groups:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy) at position 1\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl) at position 2\n    *   -NO₂ (nitro) at position 3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu:** Activating, ortho, para-director. Its large size sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n    *   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH₂ (intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NH₃⁺ (intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nWe will evaluate each sequence for chemical feasibility, paying close attention to reaction conditions and directing effects.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly deactivating groups, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring even further. Therefore, this option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used for replacement reactions (like with H₂O, CuX, etc.), not for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, this option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain an immediately obvious impossible step. Let's trace the reaction pathway, assuming we follow the major product at each step to satisfy the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large size of the tert-butyl group, substitution at the para position is heavily favored. The major product is **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 is a meta-director, and the -tBu group at C4 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 and C6). This is a powerful synthetic strategy that leads to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, giving **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps listed in the option (viii and ix) are extraneous, as a stable final product has already been formed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed as they contain chemically impossible steps. Option D describes a logical and chemically sound multi-step synthesis. While this pathway leads to an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the molecule named in the question, it is the only viable reaction sequence among the choices. In such cases, it is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and the option describing the valid synthesis is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully analyze each proposed pathway.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (position 1), -tBu (position 2), and -NO₂ (position 3).\n*   **Key Challenge:** Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene is often difficult. The main hurdles here are:\n    1.  Placing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group. Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene strongly favors the *para* position.\n    2.  Achieving the *meta* relationship between the strongly activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO₂ group.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).

This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with a plausible blocking group strategy (steps i-iii). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step (iii) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This sequence represents a plausible, multi-step synthesis.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Although the *para* isomer is the major product, the *ortho* isomer is also formed and is required for this synthesis. We assume it can be separated and carried forward.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of *o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene* is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3.

Such patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Substituent Properties (for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** A common intermediate, strongly activating, ortho/para-director. In strong acid, it becomes the **-NH3+ (anilinium) ion**, which is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will check each proposed sequence for fatal chemical flaws.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) as a blocking group (steps i, ii, iii), which is a valid strategy. However, step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step `v)`. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are not nitrated in this way; they would decompose. This is a fatal flaw in the written sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   This sequence is chemically sound for the most part.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene\n    *   ii) Nitration → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (This is the major product, making this a high-yield step).\n    *   iii) Reduction → p-tert-butylaniline\n    *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the acidic medium, the amine becomes -NH3+ (meta-director) and the t-butyl is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine, yielding 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    *   The rest of the sequence (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) is also valid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a valid synthesis, but it produces **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule. It does not produce the named product.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This sequence begins with nitration, then reduction to aniline.\n    *   Step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's see if it can produce the target molecule.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To make the target, we must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) and separate it from the major para isomer. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    *   iii) Reduction of the nitro group → 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\n    *   iv) Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine becomes the -NH3+ ion (at C1), which is a meta-director. It directs the incoming nitro group to C3. This is a plausible, though potentially low-yield, way to form the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   v) Diazotization of the amino group. (Valid)\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. (Valid)\n    *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core sequence (i-vii) is chemically plausible and is the only one among the options that can lead to the correctly named target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The final two steps (viii, ix) are extraneous, and the synthesis is likely low-yield, but it is the only path that works.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\n*   Options A and C contain fatal flaws (reactions that do not work).\n*   Option B is a valid synthesis but produces the wrong molecule (an isomer).\n*   Option D describes a chemically possible, albeit low-yield, synthesis of the correct target molecule.\n\nIn a multiple-choice question of this type, the sequence that leads to the named product is the intended answer, even if it is not perfectly efficient. Therefore, Option D is the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of the order of reactions, directing effects of substituents, and steric hindrance. The goal is to find the sequence that leads to the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** It has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern with an ethoxy (-OEt), a tert-butyl (-tBu), and a nitro (-NO₂) group.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho, para-director.\n    *   -NO₂: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is very bulky and sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions. A simple electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene (like nitration) would overwhelmingly yield the para-substituted product, not the required ortho-substituted one. A successful high-yield synthesis must overcome this steric hindrance.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Core Synthetic Strategies in the Options\n\nWe must look for a strategy that solves the problem of forcing substitution into the sterically hindered position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Direct Substitution (Low Yield).** This involves adding the tert-butyl group, then nitrating it, and hoping to separate the small amount of the ortho-nitro product that forms. This does not meet the \"high-yield\" criterion. Several options (like B in some interpretations) follow this path, making them less likely to be correct.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Friedel-Crafts on a Deactivated/Reactive Ring.** Some options propose a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (e.g., Option C/D in some analyses). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amine, deactivating the ring. This strategy is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: The Blocking Group Strategy (High Yield).** This is the textbook method to solve this exact problem.\n    1.  Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    2.  Block the sterically accessible *para* position with a reversible group, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H).\n    3.  Perform the next substitution (e.g., nitration). With the *para* position blocked, the reaction is forced to occur at the *ortho* position, overcoming the steric hindrance and leading to a high yield of the desired 1,2-substituted intermediate.\n    4.  The blocking group can be removed later in the synthesis.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Option with the Correct High-Yield Strategy\n\nWe need to find the option that begins with the blocking group strategy. Let's analyze the initial steps of the options as they are most consistently described by the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Option A** is frequently described as starting with:\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` (Adds the t-Bu group)\n    *   `ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` (Adds the blocking group to the para position)\n    *   `iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄` (Nitrates at the ortho position, as para is blocked)\n\nThis sequence perfectly matches the correct high-yield blocking group strategy. While the subsequent steps listed in the full option may be jumbled or contain errors, these initial steps are the only ones presented that can lead to a **high-yield** synthesis of an ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivative. The other options either rely on low-yield separations or contain chemically impossible steps.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the most chemically sound and strategically correct approach to the problem, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is the \"high-yield synthesis\" of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders reactions at adjacent positions.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The 1,2,3 (vicinal) arrangement is sterically crowded and requires a careful synthetic strategy.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This is a critical constraint. Any proposed pathway that involves steps known to give poor yields (e.g., significant isomer formation that requires difficult separation) should be considered less likely to be correct.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA logical approach is to plan the synthesis in reverse from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most reliable and high-yield method to form this is the Williamson ether synthesis. This requires a phenol as the precursor.\n    *   *Precursor:* 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   *Reagents:* A base like `NaOH` and an ethylating agent like `EtBr`. This set of reagents is present in all options.\n*   **The Core Challenge:** The main problem is the high-yield synthesis of the key intermediate: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options based on the Core Challenge**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences to see if they can produce this key intermediate in high yield.\n\n*   **Option B and D (as analyzed by some candidates):** These options involve a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (or a derivative). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This makes these routes non-viable.\n\n*   **Option D (as written):**\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the extreme steric bulk of the -tBu group, this reaction overwhelmingly produces the *para* isomer (~70-80%) and only a small amount of the *ortho* isomer (~15-20%). To proceed to the target, one must use the minor *ortho* isomer. This step fundamentally violates the \"high-yield\" requirement. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This option starts with a promising \"blocking group\" strategy: `i) tert-butylation`, `ii) sulfonation` (to block the para position), and `iii) nitration` (to force substitution at the ortho position). This is an excellent, high-yield method to create a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate.\n    *   However, the sequence contains a fatal flaw at step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`, which attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable reaction. Therefore, the sequence as written is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   The sequence of reactions as written in Option A is nonsensical and chemically impossible (e.g., step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is diazotization, but the required amine is not formed until step `viii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   However, let's consider the possibility that the question provides the correct *set of reagents* for a valid synthesis, but in a scrambled order. Let's see if a high-yield synthesis is possible using the \"toolkit\" from Option A.\n    *   **A Plausible High-Yield Strategy using Reagents from A:**\n        1.  **Synthesize m-nitrophenol:** This is a standard multi-step process starting from benzene. It requires nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), a second nitration to get m-dinitrobenzene (`HNO3/H2SO4`), selective reduction of one nitro group (`Fe/HCl` could be used), diazotization of the resulting amine (`NaNO2/HCl`), and finally hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to the phenol (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n        2.  **Alkylate m-nitrophenol:** React m-nitrophenol with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. The powerful activating -OH group directs the incoming -tBu group to the ortho/para positions. The position ortho to the -OH and meta to the -NO₂ (position 2) is an electronically favorable position for this reaction, leading to the desired **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        3.  **Etherify:** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether using `NaOH/EtBr`.\n    *   This entire pathway is chemically sound and avoids the low-yield steps of the other options. Option A is the only one that contains the complete set of reagents required for this elegant and plausible high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the sequence in Option A is scrambled, it is the only option that provides the necessary reagents for a viable **high-yield** synthesis of the target molecule. The other options either contain chemically impossible steps or rely on pathways that are inherently low-yield, directly contradicting a key constraint of the question. Therefore, Option A is the best choice, assuming the question's author provided the correct ingredients but in the wrong order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of multi-step organic synthesis, focusing on the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each reaction. The goal is to find a high-yield pathway to **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (position 1), -tBu (position 2), and -NO₂ (position 3).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weak activator, ortho/para-director. Its large size strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as written to determine its chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ...`\n    *   This sequence proceeds through several steps to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (like hydrolysis to a phenol, as in step vii).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is written in a chemically illogical order. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary amine. However, the amine is not formed until a much later step (viii, `Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **ii) Nitration:** The bulky t-butyl group directs nitration overwhelmingly to the para position. Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid, high-yield)\n    *   **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    *   **iv) Nitration:** This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 3 relative to the anilinium ion). Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid strategy)\n    *   **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in water to form a phenol. Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Valid)\n    *   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option B outlines a sequence of reactions that are all chemically valid and would proceed in high yield. However, this sequence produces **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the named target molecule.\n\nGiven that three of the four options are fundamentally flawed, Option B is the only plausible choice. This strongly implies that there is a typographical error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and that the valid synthetic pathway described in Option B is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
