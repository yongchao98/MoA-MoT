  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\nAll candidate answers correctly break down the information from the question to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" strongly implies a para-substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms an ester group (**-COO-**), which contains two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two distinct -CH₃ signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester.\n*   **No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester to have a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is to sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. All 15 candidate answers correctly arrive at this formula through their chemical analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\nThe DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\nD) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The analysis of the NMR splitting pattern for the propenyl group is crucial and was correctly identified by all agents.\n*   The \"no -CH₂ groups\" constraint is the key piece of negative evidence that solidifies the structure and rules out other possibilities (like C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which has the same DoU but would require an extra -CH₂- group).\n*   While the chemical analysis in all 15 candidate answers is correct, many of them made an error in mapping their final derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the correct letter option (A, B, C, or D). However, the underlying scientific conclusion is unanimous.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct chemical analysis across all provided answers, the molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Consensus in Reasoning\nA thorough review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning. Nearly every answer correctly breaks down the spectroscopic data to identify the same key structural fragments of the molecule:\n1.  A di-substituted, para-oriented aromatic ring (**C₆H₄**).\n2.  A propenyl group (**-CH=CH-CH₃**) based on the unique vinyl splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n3.  An ester group (**-COO-**) that incorporates the second methyl group without any -CH₂- groups, leading to a fragment like methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or acetate (-OCOCH₃). This fragment is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Chemical Formula\nBy summing the atoms from these unanimously identified fragments, we can determine the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester fragment) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester fragment) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester fragment) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion is supported by the overwhelming majority of the provided answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nTo double-check this result, we can calculate the DoU, which represents the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match, confirming that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Correct Option\nThe final step is to match the derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, with the options given in the original question:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option **B**.\n\n### Careful Points and Error Analysis\n*   The most common error among the candidate answers was not in the chemical analysis but in the final step of mapping the correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the correct letter (B). Many answers performed a flawless chemical deduction but then selected the wrong letter (A, C, or D), likely due to misreading or reordering the options in their internal processing.\n*   The constraint \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is critical. It correctly leads to the elimination of other potential formulas like C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (which would require saturation of the double bond, creating -CH₂- groups) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (which contains an extra -CH₂- group).\n\nBased on the consistent and correct chemical analysis performed by the majority of the agents and verified here, the chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically deduce the chemical formula by breaking down the provided spectroscopic information into molecular fragments. I will then assemble these fragments to determine the total count of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Finally, I will verify this derived formula by calculating its Degree of Unsaturation and comparing it against the structural features, before matching it to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown that the code will follow:\n1.  **Analyze Spectroscopic Data for Fragments**:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two proton signals strongly suggests a para-substituted `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group**: The 1H NMR signals of a doublet and a doublet of quartets in the vinyl region are a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has a formula of `C3H5`. This also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group**: The FTIR confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The second methyl signal, combined with the crucial information that there are no `-CH2-` groups, indicates the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these fragments have the formula `C2H3O2`.\n2.  **Assemble Fragments and Calculate Formula**: Sum the atoms from the identified fragments (`C6H4`, `C3H5`, and `C2H3O2`) to get the final molecular formula.\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: Calculate the DoU from the derived formula and compare it to the DoU expected from the structural features (aromatic ring, one C=C bond, one C=O bond) to ensure consistency.\n4.  **Select Final Answer**: Compare the derived formula to the given options (A, B, C, D) to identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem's options and deduce molecular fragments.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H14O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data:\")\n    print(\"1.

Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means the base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, giving a **C₆H₄** fragment. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals in the ¹H NMR suggests a symmetrical, likely para (1,4), substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR Data:** The spectrum shows an **ester group (-COO-)**. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl protons: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for a C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one methyl group. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Methyl Groups:** There are two signals for -CH₃ groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other ester with a methylene group. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecule (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Group: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n*   The DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options and Select the Final Answer:**\n\nThe options are:\nA) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nD) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\nOur derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option B.\n\n*   Option C (C₁₁H₁₄O₂) is incorrect because it lacks a double bond (DoU=5), which contradicts the vinyl-H signals.\n*   Option D (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect because it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which contradicts the \"no -CH₂ groups\" information.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided information and candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information from FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. A systematic analysis of these clues allows for the reconstruction of the molecule's fragments.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**. This fragment has 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU).\n*   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for **2 oxygen atoms** and adds 1 DoU due to the C=O bond.\n*   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and unambiguous splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and adds 1 DoU from the C=C bond.\n*   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n*   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other alkyl chain with a methylene group. Therefore, the second substituent must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n*   The DoU values match, confirming the derived formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option D.\n\n**Conclusion from Candidate Answers**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly deduce the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ through sound chemical reasoning. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to mapping errors or using different option lists. However, the chemical analysis is unanimously correct. Based on the provided question and options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\nThe core of this problem is to translate the spectroscopic information into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The base fragment is **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR showing only two aromatic signals suggests a symmetrical, likely para (1,4), substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**. It contains two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or contain any other methylene bridge. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\nThe values match, confirming the consistency of the derived formula.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option D.\n\n**Careful Points Analysis:**\n*   The analysis in almost all candidate answers correctly identifies the fragments and derives the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n*   The key eliminator for other options is the \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule. For example, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has the same DoU of 6 but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which is explicitly ruled out. C₁₁H₁₄O₂ has a DoU of 5, which would mean the propenyl group's double bond is missing, but this contradicts the presence of vinyl-H signals.\n*   Several candidate answers made errors in mapping their correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). However, the underlying chemical reasoning is sound and overwhelmingly points to C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only formula that fits all the constraints is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Consensus in Reasoning\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some variations in their final letter choice, follow an identical and sound line of reasoning based on the spectroscopic data. The core deductions are unanimous:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄) is identified from the description and the two aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **Ester Group:** An ester group (-COO-) is confirmed by the FTIR data.\n*   **Propenyl Group:** The specific ¹H NMR vinyl signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) are a classic pattern that unambiguously identifies a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The two methyl signals are accounted for by the propenyl group and the ester group.\n*   **No -CH₂- Groups:** This crucial constraint eliminates possibilities like ethyl or propyl groups and forces the ester to be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Formula\nAll candidate answers correctly assemble these fragments to calculate the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from the C₂H₃O₂ ester part) = **11 Carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from the C₂H₃O₂ ester part) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**.\n\nThis leads to the unanimous conclusion that the chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThis step confirms the correctness of the derived formula.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe matching DoU values provide strong confirmation.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Final Answer\nThe analytical process from all candidate answers points to a single correct formula: C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The only discrepancy among the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual responses. To determine the final answer, we must map the correct formula to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data and Structural Fragments**\n\nThe goal is to identify all the pieces of the molecule from the given data and sum their atoms to find the chemical formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**. The fact that there are only two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n*   **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons, described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and contains one C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two –CH₃ group signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups.\n    1.  One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) identified above.\n    2.  The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n*   **¹H NMR - No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COO**CH₃**) or an acetate group (-OOC**CH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecule's formula (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\n### **2. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester + Methyl part:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### **3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**\n*   **DoU from Formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nBoth C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ have the correct degree of unsaturation. However, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has an extra CH₂ group compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The ¹H NMR data explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers and addressing any inconsistencies.\n\n**1. Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **From the structural information:**\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so DoU = 4.\n    *   An ester group (-COO-) contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, so DoU = 1.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), so DoU = 1.\n    *   **Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n*   **From the given formulas (DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   A) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Possible)\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Possible)\n    *   D) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n\nThis initial analysis eliminates options A and D. The correct formula must be either C11H12O2 or C12H14O2.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments**\n\nThis step is crucial for distinguishing between the remaining options. We will identify the molecular fragments and sum their atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals for aromatic-H\" strongly implies a symmetrical, para (1,4) substituted ring. This fragment is **C6H4** and accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The signals \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" are a classic, unambiguous pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment is **C3H5** and accounts for 5 hydrogens (2 vinyl, 3 methyl).\n*   **Methyl Groups & Ester:** The spectrum shows \"two signals for –CH3 groups\". One is part of the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester. The problem states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**. This is a critical constraint. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH2-) group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2** and account for 3 hydrogens.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the fragments identified through NMR:\n*   Aromatic Ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl Group: C3H5\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from the detailed spectroscopic analysis is C11H12O2. This matches option B.\n\nLet's re-examine the other possibility from the DoU calculation, C12H14O2. To get from our derived formula C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens (a -CH2- group). However, the NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**, definitively ruling out C12H14O2.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the provided evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the question's data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\nThe core of this problem is to translate the spectroscopic data into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring with two substituents. The core formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms a **-COO-** functional group, which contains 2 oxygen atoms and a C=O double bond.\n*   **¹H NMR - No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other chains with methylene (-CH₂-) units.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Second -CH₃ group:** The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Atom Count:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe DoU is a check to ensure the formula is consistent with the structure.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Analyze Candidate Answers\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Let's match this to the provided options:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe correct option is **D**.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\n*   A vast majority of the candidate answers (at least 14 out of 15) correctly perform the structural analysis and deduce the formula to be **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates are due to inconsistent mapping of the formulas to the letters. Some candidates appear to have assumed a different order for the options than what was provided in the prompt.\n*   However, the chemical reasoning is overwhelmingly in agreement. The spectroscopic data unambiguously points to the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, which is corroborated by the reasoning in nearly all the candidate answers, the correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option D in the question's list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from the Structural Information\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the double bond equivalent, indicates the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can deduce the required DoU from the structural features described:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which accounts for **4 degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Ester group:** An ester group (-COO-) contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n\nAdding these together, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the DoU for Each of the Given Chemical Formulas\n\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7), as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or B (C12H14O2).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Build the Molecular Structure\n\nThe NMR data allows us to identify the specific fragments of the molecule.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester to have a methyl group but no methylene (-CH2-) group, it must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the formula.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester and methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Step 5: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option A. We can definitively rule out option B (C12H14O2) because, while it has the correct DoU of 6, it contains an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**, making C12H14O2 an incorrect choice.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning\n\nAll candidate answers follow a similar and correct logical path to deduce the structure from the spectroscopic data. The key points of agreement are:\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The structure described (aromatic ring + one C=C bond + one C=O bond) requires a DoU of 6. Calculating the DoU for the options narrows the possibilities to C11H12O2 (DoU=6) and C12H14O2 (DoU=6).\n\n2.  **Fragment Identification from ¹H NMR:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted ring with two proton signals implies a symmetrical, likely para-substituted, **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups & Ester:** There are two methyl signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester.\n    *   **\"No -CH2-\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- group. Therefore, the ester fragment must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Formula:** All sound analyses correctly sum the fragments:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   Hydrogens: 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   Oxygens: 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n    *   This leads to the unambiguous formula **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Identifying Errors in Candidate Answers\n\nThe reasoning across all candidates overwhelmingly supports the formula C11H12O2. The discrepancies in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) stem from clerical errors, not from flawed chemical analysis.\n\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 all correctly deduce the formula to be C11H12O2.\n*   **Incorrect Final Answer Selection:** Many answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) select a final letter that does not correspond to C11H12O2 in the original question's option list. This is likely due to using a scrambled version of the options or a simple mistake in the final step. For example, Answer 2's analysis perfectly supports C11H12O2 but incorrectly concludes with <<<C>>>, which is C12H14O2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe consensus based on a careful and repeated analysis of the spectroscopic data is that the chemical formula must be **C11H12O2**. This formula perfectly accounts for every piece of information provided, including the aromatic ring, the ester group, the specific propenyl group, the two distinct methyl groups, and the crucial absence of any -CH2- groups.\n\nAccording to the question's option list:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments\n\nAll candidate answers correctly break down the spectroscopic information to identify the key pieces of the molecule.\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. The two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggest a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR vinyl signals:** The presence of two vinyl signals, specifically a doublet and a doublet of quartets, is a classic pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n*   **¹H NMR methyl and methylene signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl (-CH₃) signals but, crucially, **no methylene (-CH₂) signals**. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part)\n*   **Carbon Count:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen Count:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen Count:** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This analysis is consistent across all provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 ring (DoU=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DoU=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DoU=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DoU=1) = **Total DoU of 6**.\n*   **From the options:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n\n### Step 4: Final Elimination\n\nBoth C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ have the correct Degree of Unsaturation. However, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has one more carbon and two more hydrogens (a -CH₂- group) than the C₁₁H₁₂O₂ formula derived from the NMR fragments. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This critical piece of information definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the original question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern (likely para) on a benzene ring that has four protons. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, critically, \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n    *   One methyl group is accounted for by the propenyl fragment.\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To satisfy the \"no -CH₂-\" constraint, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structural Features:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6** (Matches)\n\nThis calculation eliminates options B and C, leaving A and D as possibilities.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination Using All Constraints\n\nWe must now distinguish between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option A) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D).\n*   Our fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ differs from C₁₁H₁₂O₂ by one carbon and two hydrogens, which is equivalent to an additional **-CH₂- group**.\n*   The problem statement explicitly says there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This information definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **NMR Splitting Patterns:** The identification of the propenyl group from the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" vinyl signals is a key step that is correctly identified in all candidate answers.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint is the most critical piece of information for the final decision, as it allows for the elimination of C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Candidate Answer Discrepancies:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously derive the correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) through sound chemical reasoning. The variation in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to inconsistent mapping of the formulas to the letters, not a flaw in the chemical analysis itself.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** Combining DoU calculations with detailed fragment analysis provides a robust method for solving this type of problem.\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\nAll candidate answers correctly break down the information from the question to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" strongly implies a para-substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms an ester group (**-COO-**), which contains two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two distinct -CH₃ signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester.\n*   **No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester to have a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is to sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. All 15 candidate answers correctly arrive at this formula through their chemical analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\nThe DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\nD) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The analysis of the NMR splitting pattern for the propenyl group is crucial and was correctly identified by all agents.\n*   The \"no -CH₂ groups\" constraint is the key piece of negative evidence that solidifies the structure and rules out other possibilities (like C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which has the same DoU but would require an extra -CH₂- group).\n*   While the chemical analysis in all 15 candidate answers is correct, many of them made an error in mapping their final derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the correct letter option (A, B, C, or D). However, the underlying scientific conclusion is unanimous.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct chemical analysis across all provided answers, the molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Consensus in Reasoning\nA thorough review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning. Nearly every answer correctly breaks down the spectroscopic data to identify the same key structural fragments of the molecule:\n1.  A di-substituted, para-oriented aromatic ring (**C₆H₄**).\n2.  A propenyl group (**-CH=CH-CH₃**) based on the unique vinyl splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n3.  An ester group (**-COO-**) that incorporates the second methyl group without any -CH₂- groups, leading to a fragment like methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or acetate (-OCOCH₃). This fragment is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Chemical Formula\nBy summing the atoms from these unanimously identified fragments, we can determine the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester fragment) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester fragment) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester fragment) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion is supported by the overwhelming majority of the provided answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nTo double-check this result, we can calculate the DoU, which represents the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match, confirming that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Correct Option\nThe final step is to match the derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, with the options given in the original question:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option **B**.\n\n### Careful Points and Error Analysis\n*   The most common error among the candidate answers was not in the chemical analysis but in the final step of mapping the correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the correct letter (B). Many answers performed a flawless chemical deduction but then selected the wrong letter (A, C, or D), likely due to misreading or reordering the options in their internal processing.\n*   The constraint \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is critical. It correctly leads to the elimination of other potential formulas like C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (which would require saturation of the double bond, creating -CH₂- groups) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (which contains an extra -CH₂- group).\n\nBased on the consistent and correct chemical analysis performed by the majority of the agents and verified here, the chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically deduce the chemical formula by breaking down the provided spectroscopic information into molecular fragments. I will then assemble these fragments to determine the total count of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Finally, I will verify this derived formula by calculating its Degree of Unsaturation and comparing it against the structural features, before matching it to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown that the code will follow:\n1.  **Analyze Spectroscopic Data for Fragments**:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two proton signals strongly suggests a para-substituted `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group**: The 1H NMR signals of a doublet and a doublet of quartets in the vinyl region are a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has a formula of `C3H5`. This also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group**: The FTIR confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The second methyl signal, combined with the crucial information that there are no `-CH2-` groups, indicates the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these fragments have the formula `C2H3O2`.\n2.  **Assemble Fragments and Calculate Formula**: Sum the atoms from the identified fragments (`C6H4`, `C3H5`, and `C2H3O2`) to get the final molecular formula.\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: Calculate the DoU from the derived formula and compare it to the DoU expected from the structural features (aromatic ring, one C=C bond, one C=O bond) to ensure consistency.\n4.  **Select Final Answer**: Compare the derived formula to the given options (A, B, C, D) to identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem's options and deduce molecular fragments.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H14O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data:\")\n    print(\"1.

Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means the base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, giving a **C₆H₄** fragment. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals in the ¹H NMR suggests a symmetrical, likely para (1,4), substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR Data:** The spectrum shows an **ester group (-COO-)**. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl protons: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for a C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one methyl group. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Methyl Groups:** There are two signals for -CH₃ groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other ester with a methylene group. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecule (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Group: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n*   The DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n**4.

Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information from FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. A systematic analysis of these clues allows for the reconstruction of the molecule's fragments.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**. This fragment has 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU).\n*   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for **2 oxygen atoms** and adds 1 DoU due to the C=O bond.\n*   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and unambiguous splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and adds 1 DoU from the C=C bond.\n*   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n*   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other alkyl chain with a methylene group. Therefore, the second substituent must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n*   The DoU values match, confirming the derived formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n**4.

The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to mapping errors or using different option lists. However, the chemical analysis is unanimously correct. Based on the provided question and options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\nThe core of this problem is to translate the spectroscopic information into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The base fragment is **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR showing only two aromatic signals suggests a symmetrical, likely para (1,4), substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**. It contains two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or contain any other methylene bridge. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\nThe values match, confirming the consistency of the derived formula.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option D.\n\n**Careful Points Analysis:**\n*   The analysis in almost all candidate answers correctly identifies the fragments and derives the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n*   The key eliminator for other options is the \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule. For example, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has the same DoU of 6 but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which is explicitly ruled out. C₁₁H₁₄O₂ has a DoU of 5, which would mean the propenyl group's double bond is missing, but this contradicts the presence of vinyl-H signals.\n*   Several candidate answers made errors in mapping their correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). However, the underlying chemical reasoning is sound and overwhelmingly points to C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only formula that fits all the constraints is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Consensus in Reasoning\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some variations in their final letter choice, follow an identical and sound line of reasoning based on the spectroscopic data. The core deductions are unanimous:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄) is identified from the description and the two aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **Ester Group:** An ester group (-COO-) is confirmed by the FTIR data.\n*   **Propenyl Group:** The specific ¹H NMR vinyl signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) are a classic pattern that unambiguously identifies a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The two methyl signals are accounted for by the propenyl group and the ester group.\n*   **No -CH₂- Groups:** This crucial constraint eliminates possibilities like ethyl or propyl groups and forces the ester to be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Formula\nAll candidate answers correctly assemble these fragments to calculate the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from the C₂H₃O₂ ester part) = **11 Carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from the C₂H₃O₂ ester part) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**.\n\nThis leads to the unanimous conclusion that the chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThis step confirms the correctness of the derived formula.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe matching DoU values provide strong confirmation.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Final Answer\nThe analytical process from all candidate answers points to a single correct formula: C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The only discrepancy among the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual responses. To determine the final answer, we must map the correct formula to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data and Structural Fragments**\n\nThe goal is to identify all the pieces of the molecule from the given data and sum their atoms to find the chemical formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**. The fact that there are only two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n*   **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons, described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and contains one C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two –CH₃ group signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups.\n    1.  One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) identified above.\n    2.  The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n*   **¹H NMR - No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COO**CH₃**) or an acetate group (-OOC**CH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecule's formula (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\n### **2. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester + Methyl part:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### **3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**\n*   **DoU from Formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nBoth C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ have the correct degree of unsaturation. However, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has an extra CH₂ group compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The ¹H NMR data explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **From the structural information:**\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so DoU = 4.\n    *   An ester group (-COO-) contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, so DoU = 1.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), so DoU = 1.\n    *   **Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n*   **From the given formulas (DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   A) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7.

Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments**\n\nThis step is crucial for distinguishing between the remaining options. We will identify the molecular fragments and sum their atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals for aromatic-H\" strongly implies a symmetrical, para (1,4) substituted ring. This fragment is **C6H4** and accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The signals \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" are a classic, unambiguous pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment is **C3H5** and accounts for 5 hydrogens (2 vinyl, 3 methyl).\n*   **Methyl Groups & Ester:** The spectrum shows \"two signals for –CH3 groups\". One is part of the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester. The problem states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**. This is a critical constraint. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH2-) group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2** and account for 3 hydrogens.\n\n**3.

It eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other chains with methylene (-CH₂-) units.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Second -CH₃ group:** The second methyl group must be part of the ester.

We can deduce the required DoU from the structural features described:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which accounts for **4 degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Ester group:** An ester group (-COO-) contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n\nAdding these together, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the DoU for Each of the Given Chemical Formulas\n\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7), as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or B (C12H14O2).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Build the Molecular Structure\n\nThe NMR data allows us to identify the specific fragments of the molecule.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester to have a methyl group but no methylene (-CH2-) group, it must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the formula.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester and methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Step 5: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option A. We can definitively rule out option B (C12H14O2) because, while it has the correct DoU of 6, it contains an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**, making C12H14O2 an incorrect choice.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning\n\nAll candidate answers follow a similar and correct logical path to deduce the structure from the spectroscopic data. The key points of agreement are:\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The structure described (aromatic ring + one C=C bond + one C=O bond) requires a DoU of 6. Calculating the DoU for the options narrows the possibilities to C11H12O2 (DoU=6) and C12H14O2 (DoU=6).\n\n2.  **Fragment Identification from ¹H NMR:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted ring with two proton signals implies a symmetrical, likely para-substituted, **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups & Ester:** There are two methyl signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester.\n    *   **\"No -CH2-\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- group. Therefore, the ester fragment must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Formula:** All sound analyses correctly sum the fragments:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   Hydrogens: 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   Oxygens: 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n    *   This leads to the unambiguous formula **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Identifying Errors in Candidate Answers\n\nThe reasoning across all candidates overwhelmingly supports the formula C11H12O2. The discrepancies in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) stem from clerical errors, not from flawed chemical analysis.\n\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 all correctly deduce the formula to be C11H12O2.\n*   **Incorrect Final Answer Selection:** Many answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) select a final letter that does not correspond to C11H12O2 in the original question's option list. This is likely due to using a scrambled version of the options or a simple mistake in the final step. For example, Answer 2's analysis perfectly supports C11H12O2 but incorrectly concludes with <<<C>>>, which is C12H14O2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe consensus based on a careful and repeated analysis of the spectroscopic data is that the chemical formula must be **C11H12O2**. This formula perfectly accounts for every piece of information provided, including the aromatic ring, the ester group, the specific propenyl group, the two distinct methyl groups, and the crucial absence of any -CH2- groups.\n\nAccording to the question's option list:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments\n\nAll candidate answers correctly break down the spectroscopic information to identify the key pieces of the molecule.\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. The two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggest a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR vinyl signals:** The presence of two vinyl signals, specifically a doublet and a doublet of quartets, is a classic pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n*   **¹H NMR methyl and methylene signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl (-CH₃) signals but, crucially, **no methylene (-CH₂) signals**. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part)\n*   **Carbon Count:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen Count:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen Count:** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This analysis is consistent across all provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 ring (DoU=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DoU=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DoU=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DoU=1) = **Total DoU of 6**.\n*   **From the options:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n\n### Step 4: Final Elimination\n\nBoth C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ have the correct Degree of Unsaturation. However, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has one more carbon and two more hydrogens (a -CH₂- group) than the C₁₁H₁₂O₂ formula derived from the NMR fragments. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This critical piece of information definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
