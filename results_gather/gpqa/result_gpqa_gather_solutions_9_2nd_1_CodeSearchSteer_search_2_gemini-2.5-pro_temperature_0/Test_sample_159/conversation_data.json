In the limit where the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon becomes a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Physics of Diffraction by a Circular Aperture\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. The intensity minima (dark rings) of this pattern are located at specific angles determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values of the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n*   First root, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nAlternatively, using the roots directly:\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Options\nThe calculated value is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculated value `Δθ`)\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular width of the central maximum, `2θ₁`)\nD) 0.500 λ / a  (This is an incorrect approximation)\n\nThe calculated angular distance between the first and second minima is `0.5067 λ / a`, which corresponds to option B. The majority of the provided answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at this same numerical result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem specifies an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. In the limit where the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of intensity maxima and minima in the \"far field region\" after light passes through the aperture. This is the definition of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern for a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Positions of the Minima\nThe Airy pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This means the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁(x) function:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for `θ₁` and `θ₂`:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated value for the angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068 λ / a` is best matched by option A, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Other Options:**\n*   **Interpretation:** The phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" correctly means `θ₂ - θ₁`. An incorrect interpretation, as seen in one candidate answer, might take it to mean the width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), which would lead to option B.\n*   **Option C (0.610 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`). It is a common distractor.\n*   **Option B (1.220 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (`2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ / a`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side. This is also a common distractor and results from misinterpreting the question.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly performed the calculation `θ₂ - θ₁` and arrived at a value of approximately `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall the Diffraction Formula:** The intensity pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at a small angle θₘ is:\n    `k * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n3.  **Solve for Angular Position:** Rearranging the formula, we can find the angular position of the m-th minimum:\n    `θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Define the Goal:** The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) and the first minimum (θ₁):\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** To find `Δθ`, we need the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x), which are `z₁ ≈ 3.8317` and `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`. The angular distance is then:\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    I will use a Python script to calculate the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)` with high precision and compare it to the given options.\n\n6.  **Analyze Other Options:** It's important to check what the other options represent to avoid common mistakes.\n    *   Option B, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁`.\n    *   Option D, `1.220 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular width of the central bright maximum, `2θ₁`.\n    The question specifically asks for the distance between the first and second minima (`θ₂ - θ₁`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem simplifies to Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The angular positions of the minima are determined by the zeros of the J1 Bessel function.\n# The formula is: theta_m = (z_m / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where z_m is the m-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# We need the first two non-zero roots of J1(x).\n# We use scipy.special.jn_zeros to find them accurately.\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = zeros[0]\nz2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular position of the first minimum is theta_1.\n# The coefficient for theta_1 is z1 / (2 * pi).\ncoeff_theta1 = z1 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# The angular position of the second minimum is theta_2.\n# The coefficient for theta_2 is z2 / (2 * pi).\ncoeff_theta2 = z2 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is theta_2 - theta_1.\n# The coefficient for this distance is the difference between the individual coefficients.\ndelta_coeff = coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1\n\n# The given options are:\n# A) 0.500\n# B) 0.610\n# C) 0.506\n# D) 1.220\n\nprint(f\"The first zero of J1(x) is z1 = {z1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The second zero of J1(x) is z2 = {z2:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the first minimum's position (theta_1) is {coeff_theta1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the second minimum's position (theta_2) is {coeff_theta2:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(\"The angular distance between the first two minima is (theta_2 - theta_1).\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for this distance is: {delta_coeff:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.500\")\nprint(\"B) 0.610 (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum)\")\nprint(\"C) 0.506\")\nprint(\"D) 1.220 (This corresponds to the width of the central maximum, 2 * theta_1)\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated coefficient 0.5067 is best matched by option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The first zero of J1(x) is z1 = 3.8317\nThe second zero of J1(x) is z2 = 7.0156\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe coefficient for the first minimum's position (theta_1) is 0.6098\nThe coefficient for the second minimum's position (theta_2) is 1.1166\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is (theta_2 - theta_1).\nThe coefficient for this distance is: 0.5067\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 0.500\nB) 0.610 (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum)\nC) 0.506\nD) 1.220 (This corresponds to the width of the central maximum, 2 * theta_1)\n\nThe calculated coefficient 0.5067 is best matched by option C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Aperture Geometry**\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The problem asks for the behavior when N is infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Physics of Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\nThe diffraction pattern formed in the far-field by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the central intensity.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Condition for Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur at angles `θ` where the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, excluding the central point `θ=0` (which is the principal maximum).\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n`J₁(k * a * θ_m) = 0`\n\nLet `z_m` be the m-th non-zero root (or zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`, we can solve for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values of the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`. These are well-established mathematical constants:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. This is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

A key detail is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' converges to a perfect circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region.\" This is the definition of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Positions of the Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to the distance between the first dark ring (`m=1`) and the second dark ring (`m=2`). This distance is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of `J₁(x)`:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for `θ₁` and `θ₂`:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the values for the zeros:\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839) / (6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Options\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We compare this with the given options:\n\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`, not the distance between minima.)\nB) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculated value.)\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is twice the position of the first minimum, `2θ₁`, representing the angular width of the central bright disk.)\nD) 0.500 λ / a  (This is a close but less precise approximation.)\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 λ/a` is best represented by option B.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   The most critical step is correctly interpreting \"an N-sided polygon with N → ∞ and constant apothem 'a'\" as a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n*   The second critical step is correctly interpreting \"angular distance between the first two minima\" as `θ₂ - θ₁`, not `θ₁` or `2θ₁`.\n*   The calculation relies on the first two zeros of the `J₁(x)` Bessel function.\n*   The final calculation yields a coefficient of approximately 0.5067, which makes 0.506 the correct choice among the options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. In the limit where the number of sides N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem specifies that a monochromatic light wave creates an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region.\" This is the defining characteristic of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the Intensity Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ`. The formula simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This refers to the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum (m=2) and the first minimum (m=1).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) Bessel function:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is then:\n`Δθ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nSubstituting the values of the zeros:\n`Δθ = ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (3.1839 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Options\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) `1.220 λ /a`: This corresponds to `2 * θ₁`, the angular width of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk).\nB) `0.506 λ / a`: This value is an excellent match for our calculated result.\nC) `0.500 λ / a`: This is a close but less accurate approximation.\nD) `0.610 λ / a`: This corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`) itself, not the distance between two minima.\n\nThe calculation clearly supports option B as the correct answer. The vast majority of the provided candidate answers (14 out of 15) correctly interpret the question and arrive at this same conclusion through similar reasoning.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the first key step. The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'a' of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes observing an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\". This corresponds to Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings are the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThis is the most critical step. The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n*   **Interpretation A: The angular separation between the first minimum and the second minimum.** This corresponds to the distance between the first and second dark rings on one side of the central maximum. The calculation would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   **Interpretation B: The angular separation between the two symmetric first-order minima.** This corresponds to the angular width of the central bright disk (the Airy disk), defined by the minima on either side. The calculation would be `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n\nLet's calculate the values for both interpretations using the known zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**Calculation for Interpretation A (`θ₂ - θ₁`):**\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is extremely close to **0.506 λ / a**.\n\n**Calculation for Interpretation B (`2θ₁`):**\n`Δθ = 2 * θ₁ = 2 * (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (z₁ / π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.8317 / π * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 1.2197 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is extremely close to **1.220 λ / a**.\n\nWe also note the position of the first minimum itself:\n`θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\nThis is extremely close to **0.610 λ / a**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\nThe provided options are:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is `θ₁`)\nB) 0.500 λ / a  (This is an approximation of `θ₂ - θ₁`)\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is `2θ₁`)\nD) 0.506 λ / a  (This is `θ₂ - θ₁`)\n\nThe problem is that three of the options correspond to distinct, physically meaningful quantities. The choice depends entirely on interpreting the phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\".\n\n*   The most literal interpretation of \"first two\" implies an ordered sequence (the 1st and the 2nd). This supports Interpretation A (`θ₂ - θ₁`).\n*   The overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers (14 out of 15) also supports this interpretation.\n*   While the width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a very important quantity in optics, the phrasing does not point to it as strongly as it points to the difference between the first and second minima.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that the question asks for `θ₂ - θ₁`. The calculated value is `0.5067 * (λ / a)`, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the first crucial step: an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a perfect circle as the number of sides, N, tends to infinity. The radius of this resulting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem describes a far-field diffraction pattern, which is correctly identified by all candidates as Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, this specific pattern is known as an Airy pattern. The pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two dark rings (minima).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θ_m` is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number (`k = 2π / λ`).\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) as specified in the problem, the formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. This requires the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular positions are:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated value is `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` is best represented by option B, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Other Options:**\n*   **Interpretation:** The phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" most directly means the separation between the first and second dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`). One candidate answer (Answer 12) considers the possibility that it means the width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), but this is a less common interpretation for this specific phrasing.\n*   **Option D (0.610 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`), not the distance between the first and second.\n*   **Option C (1.220 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side.\n*   **Conclusion:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly perform the calculation for `θ₂ - θ₁`, and the result consistently points to `0.506 λ / a`. The discrepancies in the final letter choice in some answers appear to be due to scrambled option lists within their reasoning, not a flaw in the physics or calculation.\n\nThe correct calculation and the most direct interpretation of the question both lead to the same result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The key is the limit where N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem converges to a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This is a point of universal agreement among all the provided answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physics\nThe problem asks for the intensity pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which corresponds to Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Equation for Minima\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The equation simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is interpreted by the vast majority of the agents as the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\n`Δθ = [(z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Substitute Numerical Values\nWe need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical coefficient for `(λ / a)`:\n`Coefficient = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)`\n`Coefficient ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options and Resolve Discrepancies\nThe calculated value is `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067` is extremely close to `0.506`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Interpretation):** One agent (Answer 12) considers that the question might be asking for the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), which would be `1.220 λ / a` (Option D). However, the phrasing \"distance between the first two minima\" most commonly refers to `θ₂ - θ₁`. The \"angular width of the central maximum\" is the standard term for `2θ₁`. Given that 14 out of 15 agents chose the `θ₂ - θ₁` interpretation, it is the far more likely intended meaning.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Other Options):** Option B, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`), not the distance between the first and second. Option D, `1.220 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular width of the central bright fringe (`2θ₁`).\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Agent Answers):** The candidate answers show confusion with the option letters (A, B, C, D), as they seem to have been assigned randomly for each agent. However, the underlying calculation and the resulting numerical value are consistent across almost all agents. 13 out of 15 agents that perform the calculation arrive at the value `~0.506 λ / a`.\n\nBased on the rigorous calculation and the strong consensus on the interpretation of the question, the correct numerical coefficient is `0.506`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers and the code execution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the first key point: an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a perfect circle as the number of sides, N, tends to infinity. The radius of this resulting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.

For a circular aperture, this produces a characteristic pattern known as an Airy pattern, consisting of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two dark rings (minima).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the minima in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the J₁(x) function.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Positions\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n*   First root: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe python code executed this calculation:\n`delta_coeff = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * math.pi)`\nThe output was `0.5067`.\n\nSo, the angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated value for the angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular width of the central maximum, `2θ₁`)\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067` is best represented by option D, `0.506`. The minor difference is due to the rounding of the constants used in the problem's options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem specifies an N-sided polygonal aperture where the number of sides, N, is infinitely large. A key detail is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. An apothem is the distance from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which indicates Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.

The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θ_m` is:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate the positions of the first minimum (`θ₁`) and the second minimum (`θ₂`) and then find their difference (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`). This requires the first two non-zero roots of the `J₁(x)` function:\n\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can express the angular positions:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values for the zeros:\n\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We compare this result with the given options:\n\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 λ / a` is in excellent agreement with option A.\n\n**Careful Points and Common Mistakes:**\n*   **Option B (0.610 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a`), not the distance between the first and second minima.\n*   **Option D (1.220 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular width of the entire central bright maximum (`2 * θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side. While this is a valid physical quantity (related to the Rayleigh criterion), it does not match the most direct interpretation of \"the angular distance between the first two minima\" (i.e., the first and the second).\n*   **Interpretation:** The most straightforward interpretation of the question is the spacing between the first and second dark rings, which is `θ₂ - θ₁`. This interpretation leads directly to one of the options.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the provided analyses, backed by a direct calculation based on the zeros of the Bessel function, confirms that the angular distance between the first and second minima is `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: The Physics of Diffraction\nThe far-field diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central maximum surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n### Step 3: Formula for Minima\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values for the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing most naturally refers to the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nAlternatively, using the roots directly:\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options\nThe calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a` is compared with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular width of the central maximum, `2θ₁`)\n\nThe calculated value matches option B almost perfectly.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identified this crucial first step.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" after light passes through the aperture. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), which simplifies the formula to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is correctly interpreted by the vast majority of the candidate answers as the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function, which are well-known constants:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference between the positions calculated using these zeros:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( 3.1839 / 6.2832 ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

It is crucial not to confuse this with other related quantities.\n*   **Analysis of Distractors**: The other options represent common incorrect answers or misinterpretations:\n    *   **Option A (1.220 λ /a)** corresponds to `2θ₁`, which is the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk). This is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other.\n    *   **Option C (0.610 λ / a)** corresponds to `θ₁`, the angular *position* of the first minimum itself.\n    *   **Option D (0.500 λ / a)** is a less precise approximation of the correct answer.\n\nThe consistent analysis across nearly all candidate answers, backed by a direct calculation, confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>"

These are well-established mathematical constants:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. This is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

We are asked to consider the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon with a fixed apothem increases to infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\".

The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ`. The formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This corresponds to the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) and the first minimum (θ₁).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the angular distance:\n`Δθ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nLet's compute the numerical coefficient `C = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`.

In the limit where the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" after light passes through the aperture.

The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is interpreted as the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for `θ₁` and `θ₂`:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference between these two values:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) 0.610 λ / a: This corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`).\n*   B) 0.500 λ / a: This is an approximation, but not the most accurate value.\n*   C) 1.220 λ /a: This corresponds to the angular width of the central bright maximum (`2θ₁`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side and the first minimum on the other side.

A key detail is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' converges to a perfect circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region.\" This is the definition of Fraunhofer diffraction.

The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to the distance between the first dark ring (`m=1`) and the second dark ring (`m=2`). This distance is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of `J₁(x)`:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for `θ₁` and `θ₂`:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the values for the zeros:\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839) / (6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Options\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We compare this with the given options:\n\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`, not the distance between minima.)\nB) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculated value.)\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is twice the position of the first minimum, `2θ₁`, representing the angular width of the central bright disk.)\nD) 0.500 λ / a  (This is a close but less precise approximation.)\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 λ/a` is best represented by option B.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   The most critical step is correctly interpreting \"an N-sided polygon with N → ∞ and constant apothem 'a'\" as a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n*   The second critical step is correctly interpreting \"angular distance between the first two minima\" as `θ₂ - θ₁`, not `θ₁` or `2θ₁`.\n*   The calculation relies on the first two zeros of the `J₁(x)` Bessel function.\n*   The final calculation yields a coefficient of approximately 0.5067, which makes 0.506 the correct choice among the options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. In the limit where the number of sides N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon converges to a perfect circle.

The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThis is the most critical step. The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n*   **Interpretation A: The angular separation between the first minimum and the second minimum.** This corresponds to the distance between the first and second dark rings on one side of the central maximum. The calculation would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   **Interpretation B: The angular separation between the two symmetric first-order minima.** This corresponds to the angular width of the central bright disk (the Airy disk), defined by the minima on either side. The calculation would be `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n\nLet's calculate the values for both interpretations using the known zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**Calculation for Interpretation A (`θ₂ - θ₁`):**\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is extremely close to **0.506 λ / a**.\n\n**Calculation for Interpretation B (`2θ₁`):**\n`Δθ = 2 * θ₁ = 2 * (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (z₁ / π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.8317 / π * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 1.2197 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is extremely close to **1.220 λ / a**.\n\nWe also note the position of the first minimum itself:\n`θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\nThis is extremely close to **0.610 λ / a**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\nThe provided options are:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is `θ₁`)\nB) 0.500 λ / a  (This is an approximation of `θ₂ - θ₁`)\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is `2θ₁`)\nD) 0.506 λ / a  (This is `θ₂ - θ₁`)\n\nThe problem is that three of the options correspond to distinct, physically meaningful quantities. The choice depends entirely on interpreting the phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\".\n\n*   The most literal interpretation of \"first two\" implies an ordered sequence (the 1st and the 2nd). This supports Interpretation A (`θ₂ - θ₁`).\n*   The overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers (14 out of 15) also supports this interpretation.\n*   While the width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a very important quantity in optics, the phrasing does not point to it as strongly as it points to the difference between the first and second minima.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that the question asks for `θ₂ - θ₁`.

The radius of this resulting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem describes a far-field diffraction pattern, which is correctly identified by all candidates as Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, this specific pattern is known as an Airy pattern. The pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two dark rings (minima).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θ_m` is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number (`k = 2π / λ`).\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) as specified in the problem, the formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. This requires the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular positions are:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated value is `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` is best represented by option B, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Other Options:**\n*   **Interpretation:** The phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" most directly means the separation between the first and second dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`). One candidate answer (Answer 12) considers the possibility that it means the width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), but this is a less common interpretation for this specific phrasing.\n*   **Option D (0.610 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`), not the distance between the first and second.\n*   **Option C (1.220 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side.\n*   **Conclusion:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly perform the calculation for `θ₂ - θ₁`, and the result consistently points to `0.506 λ / a`. The discrepancies in the final letter choice in some answers appear to be due to scrambled option lists within their reasoning, not a flaw in the physics or calculation.\n\nThe correct calculation and the most direct interpretation of the question both lead to the same result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The key is the limit where N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem converges to a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This is a point of universal agreement among all the provided answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physics\nThe problem asks for the intensity pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which corresponds to Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Equation for Minima\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The equation simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is interpreted by the vast majority of the agents as the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\n`Δθ = [(z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Substitute Numerical Values\nWe need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical coefficient for `(λ / a)`:\n`Coefficient = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)`\n`Coefficient ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options and Resolve Discrepancies\nThe calculated value is `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067` is extremely close to `0.506`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Interpretation):** One agent (Answer 12) considers that the question might be asking for the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), which would be `1.220 λ / a` (Option D). However, the phrasing \"distance between the first two minima\" most commonly refers to `θ₂ - θ₁`. The \"angular width of the central maximum\" is the standard term for `2θ₁`. Given that 14 out of 15 agents chose the `θ₂ - θ₁` interpretation, it is the far more likely intended meaning.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Other Options):** Option B, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`), not the distance between the first and second. Option D, `1.220 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular width of the central bright fringe (`2θ₁`).\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Agent Answers):** The candidate answers show confusion with the option letters (A, B, C, D), as they seem to have been assigned randomly for each agent. However, the underlying calculation and the resulting numerical value are consistent across almost all agents. 13 out of 15 agents that perform the calculation arrive at the value `~0.506 λ / a`.\n\nBased on the rigorous calculation and the strong consensus on the interpretation of the question, the correct numerical coefficient is `0.506`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers and the code execution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the first key point: an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a perfect circle as the number of sides, N, tends to infinity. The radius of this resulting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physics\nThe problem describes a diffraction pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which corresponds to Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, this produces a characteristic pattern known as an Airy pattern, consisting of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two dark rings (minima).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the minima in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the J₁(x) function.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Positions\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n*   First root: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe python code executed this calculation:\n`delta_coeff = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * math.pi)`\nThe output was `0.5067`.\n\nSo, the angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated value for the angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular width of the central maximum, `2θ₁`)\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067` is best represented by option D, `0.506`. The minor difference is due to the rounding of the constants used in the problem's options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem specifies an N-sided polygonal aperture where the number of sides, N, is infinitely large. A key detail is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. An apothem is the distance from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which indicates Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two dark rings (minima).\n\n### Step 3: The Formula for Diffraction Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θ_m` is:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate the positions of the first minimum (`θ₁`) and the second minimum (`θ₂`) and then find their difference (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`). This requires the first two non-zero roots of the `J₁(x)` function:\n\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can express the angular positions:\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values for the zeros:\n\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We compare this result with the given options:\n\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 λ / a` is in excellent agreement with option A.\n\n**Careful Points and Common Mistakes:**\n*   **Option B (0.610 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a`), not the distance between the first and second minima.\n*   **Option D (1.220 λ / a):** This value corresponds to the angular width of the entire central bright maximum (`2 * θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side. While this is a valid physical quantity (related to the Rayleigh criterion), it does not match the most direct interpretation of \"the angular distance between the first two minima\" (i.e., the first and the second).\n*   **Interpretation:** The most straightforward interpretation of the question is the spacing between the first and second dark rings, which is `θ₂ - θ₁`. This interpretation leads directly to one of the options.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the provided analyses, backed by a direct calculation based on the zeros of the Bessel function, confirms that the angular distance between the first and second minima is `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: The Physics of Diffraction\nThe far-field diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central maximum surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n### Step 3: Formula for Minima\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values for the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing most naturally refers to the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nAlternatively, using the roots directly:\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options\nThe calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a` is compared with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular width of the central maximum, `2θ₁`)\n\nThe calculated value matches option B almost perfectly. The minor difference is due to rounding.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
