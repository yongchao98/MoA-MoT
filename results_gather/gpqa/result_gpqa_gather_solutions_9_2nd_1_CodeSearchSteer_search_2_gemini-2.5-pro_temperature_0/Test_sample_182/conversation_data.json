Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   The core structure is a six-membered ring (`cyclohex`).\n*   It has one C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n*   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   It has a formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), which contains a C=C double bond.\n*   The carbon skeleton consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the acid, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to completely reduce multiple bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond (forming an ethyl group).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the entire group will become a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the entire group will become a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the ring structure itself is not broken by this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\nThe reaction removes all pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) and all oxygen atoms. The only feature contributing to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) that remains is the original ring.\n*   The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane).\n*   The number of carbon atoms remains 10.\n*   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the product's molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero pi bonds.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n**5.

The overwhelming consensus on the chemical reasoning points to an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Carbon Skeleton:** The molecule has a 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`), a 1-carbon carboxylic acid group, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group. This gives a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Unsaturation:** The molecule has several features that contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):\n    *   One ring (`cyclohex`)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Reagent Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its purpose is to perform a complete reduction, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds and completely reduces oxygen-containing groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkane parts (-CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bonds in the formyl and carboxylic acid groups are reduced, and the oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Preservation of the Ring:** This strong reduction does not break the ring structure. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring. Since the carbon count is preserved (10 carbons), the product is a substituted cyclohexane with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀ (following the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD measures the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **Method 1: By Structure:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has **one ring** and **zero pi bonds** (as it is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n*   **Method 2: By Molecular Formula:** The product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Final Check**\n\nThe calculated value is 1. The provided options are A) 1, B) 0, C) 3, D) 5.

Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring (IHD = 1) with one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\nThe total IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to completely reduce various functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) and removes the oxygen atoms.\n*   Specifically, it reduces both carboxylic acids (-COOH) and aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the ring structure of the molecule.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring is reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD of the final product can be determined by its structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). Therefore, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the product is the sum of these two values:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Molecular Formula**\n1.  **Reactant Carbons**: 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n2.  **Product Formula**: The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbons. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n3.  **IHD Calculation**: Using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2):\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n**5.

The total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Points of Unsaturation (for understanding, not strictly necessary for the final answer):**\n    *   One ring structure.\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction of the given functional groups and multiple bonds.\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane parts. Both -CHO and -COOH are reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Crucially, the reaction does not break the carbon ring.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction saturates all double bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, but preserves the 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH`, `-CHO`, and `-CH=CH₂` groups become `-CH₃`, `-CH₃`, and `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl) respectively.\n*   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated, monocyclic alkane.\n*   The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated from the product's structure or its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (the product is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   Let's count the carbon atoms to determine the carbon skeleton of the product, as this reaction does not alter the number of carbons.\n    *   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   The total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **10 carbons**.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\n*   The reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of various functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The specific transformations are:\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups are completely reduced and the oxygen atoms are removed. Aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) are both reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the ring structure of the molecule is not broken during this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction starts with a molecule containing a ring, multiple double bonds (both C=C and C=O), and oxygen atoms.\n*   The reaction reduces all these features, leaving only a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   The product will be a **cyclohexane ring** (the ring remains, but the double bond within it is removed) with alkyl substituents.\n*   Since all points of unsaturation (except the ring itself) are removed, the product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n*   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   As we determined the product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, quantifies the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Analysis of the Structure**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1.\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (it is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    *   The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency for the final product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the ring.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Carbon Skeleton\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The first step is to determine the total number of carbon atoms, which will be conserved throughout the reaction.\n*   `cyclohex`: A six-carbon ring.\n*   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group, which contains one carbon.\n*   `formyl`: A -CHO group, which contains one carbon.\n*   `vinyl`: A -CH=CH₂ group, which contains two carbons.\nThe total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (aldehydes, carboxylic acids) completely to their corresponding alkane forms. For example, both -CHO and -COOH groups are reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n*   Preserve the carbon skeleton, including the ring structure. The reaction does not break the ring.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon while keeping the 10-carbon skeleton and the ring intact.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula must follow the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the product's molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nThere are two reliable methods to calculate this for the product:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on the structure.** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains **one ring** and, being fully saturated, **zero π bonds**.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant, which is 5 (1 for the ring, 1 for the C=C in the ring, 1 for the C=C in the vinyl group, 1 for the C=O in the formyl group, and 1 for the C=O in the acid group). This corresponds to option D and is a distractor.\n*   The unanimous conclusion from the reasoning of all provided answers is that the IHD of the product is 1. The discrepancies in the final letter choices of the agents appear to be due to different option mappings in their prompts, but their chemical calculation is consistent and correct.\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   The core of the molecule is a six-membered carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n*   The name indicates several features that contribute to unsaturation (double bonds or rings):\n    *   `cyclohex`: One ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: One carbon-carbon double bond within the ring.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): One carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): One carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): One carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   Its function is to completely reduce most functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   Specifically, it will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) to single bonds and remove the oxygen atoms.\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon ring.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\nThe reaction transforms the starting material as follows:\n*   The C=C bond in the `cyclohexene` ring is reduced, resulting in a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The C=C bond in the `vinyl` group is reduced, converting it to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the `formyl` group is reduced, and the entire group becomes a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the `carboxylic acid` group is reduced, and the entire group becomes a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon that still contains the six-membered ring. It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Number of Rings:** The product retains the single cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π Bonds:** The powerful reduction reaction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. Therefore, the number of π bonds in the product is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently shows that all points of unsaturation (all double bonds) are removed by the reaction, but the ring structure remains.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To understand the transformation, we must first identify its key structural features.\n*   **Carbon Skeleton**: The molecule has a six-carbon ring (`cyclohex`), a one-carbon formyl group (-CHO), a one-carbon carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a two-carbon vinyl group (-CH=CH₂). The total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. This carbon skeleton is preserved during the reaction.\n*   **Points of Unsaturation**: The molecule contains several features that contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD): a ring, a C=C double bond within the ring, a C=C double bond in the vinyl group, a C=O double bond in the formyl group, and a C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to perform a complete reduction of the molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups, such as aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), completely to their alkane counterparts. Both groups are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃), and the oxygen atoms are removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction transforms the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon while keeping the 10-carbon skeleton and the ring intact.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD, or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains **one ring** and, being fully saturated, **zero π bonds**.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula**\n    The product is a monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀. Using the IHD formula for a hydrocarbon (IHD = C + 1 - H/2):\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Product vs. Reactant**: The question asks for the IHD of the *product*, not the reactant. The IHD of the reactant is 5, which is a potential distractor.\n*   **Reaction Scope**: It is crucial to recognize that red P and excess HI cause a *complete* reduction, eliminating all double bonds and oxygen atoms, but leaving the ring structure intact.\n*   **IHD Definition**: The final IHD of 1 corresponds solely to the presence of the single ring in the otherwise fully saturated product.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   The core structure is a six-membered ring (`cyclohex`).\n*   It has one C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n*   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   It has a formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), which contains a C=C double bond.\n*   The carbon skeleton consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the acid, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to completely reduce multiple bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond (forming an ethyl group).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the entire group will become a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the entire group will become a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the ring structure itself is not broken by this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\nThe reaction removes all pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) and all oxygen atoms. The only feature contributing to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) that remains is the original ring.\n*   The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane).\n*   The number of carbon atoms remains 10.\n*   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the product's molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero pi bonds.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n**5.

Deconstruct the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Carbon Skeleton:** The molecule has a 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`), a 1-carbon carboxylic acid group, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group. This gives a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Unsaturation:** The molecule has several features that contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):\n    *   One ring (`cyclohex`)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Reagent Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its purpose is to perform a complete reduction, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds and completely reduces oxygen-containing groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkane parts (-CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bonds in the formyl and carboxylic acid groups are reduced, and the oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Preservation of the Ring:** This strong reduction does not break the ring structure. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring. Since the carbon count is preserved (10 carbons), the product is a substituted cyclohexane with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀ (following the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD measures the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **Method 1: By Structure:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has **one ring** and **zero pi bonds** (as it is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n*   **Method 2: By Molecular Formula:** The product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Final Check**\n\nThe calculated value is 1. The provided options are A) 1, B) 0, C) 3, D) 5.

Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring (IHD = 1) with one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\nThe total IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to completely reduce various functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) and removes the oxygen atoms.\n*   Specifically, it reduces both carboxylic acids (-COOH) and aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the ring structure of the molecule.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring is reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD of the final product can be determined by its structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). Therefore, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the product is the sum of these two values:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Molecular Formula**\n1.  **Reactant Carbons**: 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n2.  **Product Formula**: The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbons. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n3.  **IHD Calculation**: Using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2):\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n**5.

The total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Points of Unsaturation (for understanding, not strictly necessary for the final answer):**\n    *   One ring structure.\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction of the given functional groups and multiple bonds.\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane parts. Both -CHO and -COOH are reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Crucially, the reaction does not break the carbon ring.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction saturates all double bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, but preserves the 10-carbon skeleton, including the ring.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH`, `-CHO`, and `-CH=CH₂` groups become `-CH₃`, `-CH₃`, and `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl) respectively.\n*   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated, monocyclic alkane.\n*   The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated from the product's structure or its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the Structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (the product is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   Let's count the carbon atoms to determine the carbon skeleton of the product, as this reaction does not alter the number of carbons.\n    *   `cyclohex`: 6 carbons in the ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): 1 carbon.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): 1 carbon.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): 2 carbons.\n*   The total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **10 carbons**.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\n*   The reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of various functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The specific transformations are:\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups are completely reduced and the oxygen atoms are removed. Aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) are both reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the ring structure of the molecule is not broken during this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction starts with a molecule containing a ring, multiple double bonds (both C=C and C=O), and oxygen atoms.\n*   The reaction reduces all these features, leaving only a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   The product will be a **cyclohexane ring** (the ring remains, but the double bond within it is removed) with alkyl substituents.\n*   Since all points of unsaturation (except the ring itself) are removed, the product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n*   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   As we determined the product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, quantifies the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Analysis of the Structure**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1.\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (it is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    *   The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency for the final product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the ring.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Carbon Skeleton\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The first step is to determine the total number of carbon atoms, which will be conserved throughout the reaction.\n*   `cyclohex`: A six-carbon ring.\n*   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group, which contains one carbon.\n*   `formyl`: A -CHO group, which contains one carbon.\n*   `vinyl`: A -CH=CH₂ group, which contains two carbons.\nThe total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (aldehydes, carboxylic acids) completely to their corresponding alkane forms. For example, both -CHO and -COOH groups are reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n*   Preserve the carbon skeleton, including the ring structure. The reaction does not break the ring.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon while keeping the 10-carbon skeleton and the ring intact.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula must follow the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the product's molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nThere are two reliable methods to calculate this for the product:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on the structure.** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains **one ring** and, being fully saturated, **zero π bonds**.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant, which is 5 (1 for the ring, 1 for the C=C in the ring, 1 for the C=C in the vinyl group, 1 for the C=O in the formyl group, and 1 for the C=O in the acid group). This corresponds to option D and is a distractor.\n*   The unanimous conclusion from the reasoning of all provided answers is that the IHD of the product is 1. The discrepancies in the final letter choices of the agents appear to be due to different option mappings in their prompts, but their chemical calculation is consistent and correct.\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   The core of the molecule is a six-membered carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n*   The name indicates several features that contribute to unsaturation (double bonds or rings):\n    *   `cyclohex`: One ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: One carbon-carbon double bond within the ring.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): One carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): One carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): One carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   Its function is to completely reduce most functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   Specifically, it will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) to single bonds and remove the oxygen atoms.\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon ring.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\nThe reaction transforms the starting material as follows:\n*   The C=C bond in the `cyclohexene` ring is reduced, resulting in a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The C=C bond in the `vinyl` group is reduced, converting it to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the `formyl` group is reduced, and the entire group becomes a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the `carboxylic acid` group is reduced, and the entire group becomes a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon that still contains the six-membered ring. It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Number of Rings:** The product retains the single cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π Bonds:** The powerful reduction reaction eliminates all C=C and C=O double bonds. Therefore, the number of π bonds in the product is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π Bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently shows that all points of unsaturation (all double bonds) are removed by the reaction, but the ring structure remains.
