Identify the System's States and Energy**\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. The energy for each state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nWe need to calculate the energy for all 8 possible configurations. A systematic way to do this is to group the states by their spin configurations.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[3] = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes states with two spins up and one down, and states with one spin up and two down. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, (+1, +1, -1):\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all other states in this category will have the same energy. These states are:\n        *   (+1, +1, -1)\n        *   (+1, -1, +1)\n        *   (-1, +1, +1)\n        *   (+1, -1, -1)\n        *   (-1, +1, -1)\n        *   (-1, -1, +1)\n    *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**.\n\n**3. Determine Energy Levels and Degeneracies**\nFrom the calculations, we have two distinct energy levels:\n*   Energy Level E₁ = -3J, with degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   Energy Level E₂ = J, with degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n*   **Careful Point:** A quick check confirms we have accounted for all states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be written as a sum over the energy levels weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the signs in the exponents. The term e^(-βE₁) becomes e^(-β * -3J) = e^(3Jβ).\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Let's compare this with the given options:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result matches option A exactly.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nAll provided candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical expression Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). However, several of them make a mistake in the final step of matching this result to the correct letter option, often because the options were re-ordered in their response. The mathematical derivation is sound and consistent across all agents, and it points unequivocally to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, I will systematically re-derive the partition function for the given system and then compare the result to the provided options. This process will allow for a clear identification of the correct calculation and the correct corresponding option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the System and States**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Levels and Degeneracies**: The energy is given by `E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]`. We need to find the energy for all 8 states and group them. A reliable way to do this is to consider the two distinct types of configurations.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        *   State (+1, +1, +1): `E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J`\n        *   State (-1, -1, -1): `E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J`\n        *   There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        *   This includes 3 states with two spins up and one down (e.g., +1, +1, -1) and 3 states with one spin up and two down (e.g., +1, -1, -1). This gives a total of 6 states.\n        *   Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, (+1, +1, -1):\n            `E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J`\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the energy function, all 6 of these states have the same energy.\n        *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n3.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum over all states, which can be grouped by energy levels and their degeneracies (g):\n    `Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)`\n    `Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)`\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    `Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))`\n    `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`\n\n4.  **Compare with Given Options**: Now, we compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    *   B) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    *   C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    *   D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    Our calculated expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` perfectly matches option B.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\nAll provided candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. The discrepancies in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, or D) arise because they seem to be referencing different or scrambled lists of options. However, the underlying physics and mathematical derivation are unanimously correct across all candidates. Based on the options provided in the original problem description, the correct choice is B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **State Enumeration**: It is critical to account for all 8 microstates without omission or duplication.\n*   **Energy Calculation**: The energy for each state must be calculated correctly, paying close attention to the signs.\n*   **Degeneracy**: Correctly grouping states by their energy level is essential. There are two energy levels: -3J (with 2 states) and +J (with 6 states).\n*   **Boltzmann Factor**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is `-βE`. A sign error here is a common mistake. For the energy level E = -3J, the term is `e^(-β(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ)`.\n*   **Matching**: The final derived expression must be carefully matched against the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem from first principles to establish a correct answer, and then analyze the provided candidate answers. The core of the task is to calculate the partition function `Z`, which involves summing the Boltzmann factor `exp(-βE)` over all possible states of the system.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Identify all possible states:** The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 unique microstates.\n2.  **Calculate the energy for each state:** For each of the 8 states, I will calculate the energy using the formula `E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]`.\n3.  **Group states by energy:** I will group the states that have the same energy value and count how many states fall into each group. This count is known as the degeneracy of the energy level.\n4.  **Construct the partition function:** The partition function `Z` is the sum of `(degeneracy) * exp(-βE)` for each unique energy level.\n5.  **Compare and decide:** I will compare the resulting expression for `Z` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct choice.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform these calculations systematically and avoid manual errors. The script will iterate through all 8 states, compute their energies, count the degeneracies, and construct the final expression for Z.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the partition function for a system of three spins by enumerating all states.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Each spin can be +1 or -1\n    spin_values = [1, -1]\n    \n    # We will store the energy coefficient for each state.

Define the System and its States**\n*   The system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1.\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Energy and Partition Function**\n*   The energy of a given state is E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 states: Z = Σ_states e^(-βE).\n*   A more efficient method is to group states with the same energy level (Eᵢ) and use their degeneracy (gᵢ): Z = Σ_levels gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ).\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for All Possible States**\nWe need to evaluate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. We can group them by their configuration type.\n\n*   **Case A: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [3] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   **Result for Case A:** There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case B: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes states with two +1 spins and one -1 spin, and states with one +1 spin and two -1 spins. There are 6 such states in total. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, e.g., (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   State 3: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the energy function, all 6 states in this category will have the same energy. These states are:\n        (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n        (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n    *   **Result for Case B:** There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**.

Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This means there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations (microstates) for the system.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\nThe energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates. A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states that have the same energy level and sum their contributions.\nZ = Σ_levels gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nwhere gᵢ is the degeneracy (the number of states) of the energy level Eᵢ.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each State and Find Degeneracies**\nWe can classify the 8 states into two groups based on their spin configurations:\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This group includes the state where all spins are up and the state where all spins are down.\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    There are **2 states** with an energy of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This group includes all states where two spins are up and one is down, or one spin is up and two are down. There are 6 such states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for example, (+1, +1, -1):\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **J**\n    Due to the symmetry of the energy equation, all 6 of these states will have the same energy.\n    The 6 states are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    There are **6 states** with an energy of E₂ = J. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n**5. Construct the Partition Function Z**\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   Contribution from the first energy level (E₁ = -3J):\n    g₁ * e^(-βE₁) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n\n*   Contribution from the second energy level (E₂ = J):\n    g₂ * e^(-βE₂) = 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\nWe compare our calculated result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct partition function Z, we must systematically evaluate the energy for every possible state of the system and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\n**1. System Definition and States**\n*   The system has three spins: S1, S2, S3.\n*   Each spin can be +1 or -1.\n*   This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\nThe energy for each state is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to calculate this for all 8 states. A systematic way is to group the states by their configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. The energy is E = -J(3) = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. The energy is E = -J(3) = -3J.\n    *   There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This comprises states with two spins up and one down, and states with one spin up and two down. Let's take one example: (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. The energy is E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the problem, all other states of this type will have the same energy. These states are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**.\n\n**3. Careful Points in Calculation**\n*   It is crucial to correctly calculate the sum of products (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) for each configuration.\n*   The overall negative sign in the energy formula, E = **-J**[...], must be applied correctly.\n*   The negative sign in the Boltzmann factor, e^(**-β**E), must also be applied. For the first energy level, the exponent becomes -βE₁ = -β(-3J) = +3Jβ. For the second energy level, it becomes -βE₂ = -β(J) = -Jβ.\n*   The degeneracy (the number of states for each energy level) must be counted accurately.

The Energy Function**\nThe energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\n**3. The Partition Function**\nThe partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all 8 microstates. A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states that have the same energy level, count how many states are in each group (the degeneracy), and then sum the contributions from each energy level.\nZ = Σ_levels gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nwhere gᵢ is the degeneracy of the energy level Eᵢ.\n\n**4.

Define the System and States**\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\nThe energy for each state is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The most effective way to solve this is to calculate the energy for each of the 8 states and then group them by energy level.\n\n*   **State 1: All spins aligned (ferromagnetic states)**\n    *   (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**.\n\n*   **State 2: One spin flipped (frustrated states)**\n    *   This category includes states with two spins up and one down, or one spin up and two down. Let's test one configuration, for example, (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the equation, all other 6 states where the spins are not all aligned will have the same energy. These states are:\n        *   (+1, +1, -1)\n        *   (+1, -1, +1)\n        *   (-1, +1, +1)\n        *   (+1, -1, -1)\n        *   (-1, +1, -1)\n        *   (-1, -1, +1)\n    *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**.\n\n**3.

This confirms we have accounted for all possible configurations.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum over all energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5.

Calculate the Energy for Each State and Find Degeneracies**\nWe can classify the 8 states into two groups based on their spin configurations:\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This group includes the state where all spins are up and the state where all spins are down.\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    There are **2 states** with an energy of E₁ = -3J.

Calculate the Energy for All States and Find Degeneracies**\nThe most reliable method is to list all 8 states, calculate their energy, and then group them by energy level.\n\nLet's calculate the term `Sum = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` for each state. The energy will be `E = -J * Sum`.\n\n| State Configuration (S1, S2, S3) | `Sum = S1S2+S1S3+S2S3` | Energy `E = -J * Sum` |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J |\n| | | |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J |\n\nFrom this table, we can group the states by their energy levels:\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J**: This energy level corresponds to 2 states (all spins up or all spins down).
