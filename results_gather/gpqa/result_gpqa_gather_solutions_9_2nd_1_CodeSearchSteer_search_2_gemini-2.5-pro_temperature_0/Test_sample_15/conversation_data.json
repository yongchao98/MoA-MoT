A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer) of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration in this symmetrical molecule results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer).\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two identical halves. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or specific isomer names indicates we are considering a single stereoisomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound has chiral centers and a specific, single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetrical, and the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion in its staggered conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the presence of the double bond. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, there are 3 optically active compounds in the list.

The key features I will look for are:\n1.  **Chiral Centers**: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Symmetry Elements**: The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral, even if it has chiral centers (this is the case for meso compounds).\n3.  **Stereochemical Descriptors**: Names including (R), (S), or other specific stereochemical terms indicate that a single stereoisomer is being considered, which is optically active by definition unless it's a meso compound.\n\nI will go through each compound one by one, count the number of optically active ones, and then select the correct option from the list provided.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # List of compounds with their analysis for chirality/optical activity.\n    # True means optically active, False means optically inactive.\n    compounds_analysis = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The naming conventions that specify stereochemistry, such as (R), (S), or a specific stereoisomer's name, indicate that we are considering a single stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that we are considering a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. A single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule whose mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups and is therefore not chiral.

    "To determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (its mirror image is non-superimposable) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane.

This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration in this symmetrical molecule results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer).\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. C1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`).

This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two identical halves. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups.

This indicates that the compound has chiral centers and a specific, single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetrical, and the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion in its staggered conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the presence of the double bond. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.

Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposing CH₂ group bisects the molecule into two identical halves. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each one for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). Naming a compound with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S) implies we are considering a single, pure stereoisomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has specific chiral centers and that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure (`HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.
