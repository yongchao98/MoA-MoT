In astrophysics, this refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen, the most common element. The goal is to calculate:\n    Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂\n\n    The problem uses the standard bracket notation `[X/Y]`, which is defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1:**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`. We can find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance, `[Si/H]₁`, using the following identity:\n    `[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n    `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2:**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`. We can relate these abundances using the same identity:\n    `[Mg/H]₂ = [Mg/Si]₂ + [Si/H]₂`\n    To find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star_2, `[Si/H]₂`, we rearrange the equation:\n    `[Si/H]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Mg/Si]₂`\n    `[Si/H]₂ = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    The ratio we want to find can be derived from the difference in the `[Si/H]` values of the two stars.\n    `[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = (log10( (n_Si/n_H)₁ ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun )) - (log10( (n_Si/n_H)₂ ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun ))`\n\n    The solar abundance term, `log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun )`, cancels out, leaving:\n    `[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = log10( (n_Si/n_H)₁ ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)₂ )`\n    Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n    `[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = log10( (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂ )`\n\n    Substituting the values we calculated:\n    `0.3 - (-0.3) = log10( Ratio )`\n    `0.6 = log10( Ratio )`\n\n    To find the final ratio, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of 0.6):\n    `Ratio = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.981`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 3.98.

In astrophysics, this is understood to mean the ratio of the silicon abundance fractions relative to hydrogen (the most abundant element). The goal is to calculate:\n    Ratio = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂\n\n    The problem uses the standard bracket notation `[X/Y]`, which is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the number densities (n) of elements X and Y in a star compared to the same ratio in the Sun:\n    `[X/Y] = log₁₀( (nₓ/nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ ) - log₁₀( (nₓ/nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ )`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1:** We need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]₁`. We can use the given values for Star 1 (`[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`) and the standard abundance identity:\n    `[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n    `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2:** Similarly, we need to find `[Si/H]₂` for Star 2 using the given values (`[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`). The relevant identity is `[Mg/H]₂ = [Mg/Si]₂ + [Si/H]₂`. We must rearrange it to solve for `[Si/H]₂`:\n    `[Si/H]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Mg/Si]₂`\n    `[Si/H]₂ = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** The ratio of the abundance fractions can be found from the difference in their logarithmic `[Si/H]` values.\n    `log₁₀(Ratio) = log₁₀( (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ )`\n    From the definition of the bracket notation, this difference is:\n    `log₁₀(Ratio) = [Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂`\n    Substituting the values we calculated:\n    `log₁₀(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\n5.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** To find the final linear ratio, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of the result):\n    `Ratio = 10⁰.⁶`\n    `Ratio ≈ 3.981`\n\n6.  **Match to Options:** The calculated value of ~3.98 is closest to the option **A) ~3.9**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"ratio of silicon atoms\" must be correctly interpreted as the ratio of abundance fractions `(n_Si/n_H)`, not the ratio of the absolute number of atoms in the entire photosphere.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides extra information that is not needed for the calculation. This includes the stellar masses (1.5 and 1.2 M_sun), the specific solar abundances for Fe and Mg, and the methods used (LTE, EW). Recognizing which information is relevant is key to solving the problem efficiently.\n*   **Abundance Identities:** The core of the solution lies in correctly applying the identities that relate different abundance ratios, such as `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]` and its various rearrangements.\n*   **Logarithmic Scale:** The \"dex\" unit signifies a base-10 logarithmic scale. A common mistake is to forget the final step of converting the logarithmic result (`0.6`) back to a linear ratio by taking the antilog (`10^0.6`).\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of ~3.98. The discrepancies between them lie only in incorrectly matching this result to the given lettered options. The correct calculation leads to ~3.9, which is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first determining the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, denoted as `[Si/H]`, for each of the two stars.

I'll rearrange the identity `[Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H]` to solve for `[Si/H]`.\n3.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** The ratio of silicon atoms is `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.

Understand the Goal and Notation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In stellar astrophysics, this refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen (H), the most abundant element. The goal is to calculate:\nRatio = (n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂\n\nThe problem uses the standard bracket notation for elemental abundances:\n`[X/Y] = log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of elements X and Y.\n\n**2. Identify Careful Points and Key Information**\n\n*   **Key Identity:** A crucial property of this notation is that logarithmic abundances can be combined. The most useful identity for this problem is: `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`. This can be rearranged as needed, for example: `[B/C] = [A/C] - [A/B]`.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides extra information that is not needed for the calculation. This is a common feature in physics and astronomy problems to test understanding. The irrelevant data includes:\n    *   The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 M_sun).\n    *   The method of determination (LTE, EW method).\n    *   The specific absolute abundances of Fe and Mg in the Sun (12 + log₁₀(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5, etc.).\n    The calculation relies only on the relative abundance ratios (`[X/Y]`).\n\n**3.

It's easiest to work with the logarithm of the ratio first.\n    `log₁₀(R) = log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₂ )`\n    From the definition of `[X/Y]`, we can show that this difference is equal to the difference in the `[Si/H]` values:\n    `log₁₀(R) = [Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂`\n    Now, substitute the values calculated in the previous steps:\n    `log₁₀(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\n*   **Step 3d: Compute the Numerical Value**\n    To find the final ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of the value):\n    `R = 10^0.6`\n    `R ≈ 3.981`\n\n**4.

In astrophysics, this is interpreted as the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen, the most common element. So, we need to calculate:\nRatio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2\n\nThe problem uses the standard bracket notation for elemental abundances:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of elements X and Y.\n\nA key property derived from this definition, which simplifies calculations, is:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n\nWe can find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]_1`, by applying the identity from Step 1:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe use the same identity: `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`. To find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]_2`, we must rearrange the formula:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio\nThe ratio we want is `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`. The most direct way to find this is to subtract the logarithmic abundances we found in the previous steps.\n\nFrom the definition of `[X/Y]`:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = [log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_sun)] - [log10((n_Si/n_H)_2) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_sun)]`\n\nThe solar abundance term, `log10((n_Si/n_H)_sun)`, cancels out, leaving:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)`:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2 )`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we calculated:\n`log10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the final linear ratio, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of the value):\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n`Ratio ≈ 3.981`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The masses of the stars, the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg, and the observational methods (LTE, EW) are contextual details not required for the mathematical calculation. They are red herrings.\n*   **Correct Identity Usage**: The key is using the identity `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]` and rearranging it correctly for Star 2 (`[Si/H] = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si]`).\n*   **Logarithm Rules**: The final step requires subtracting the logarithmic values (`0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`) and then converting the result back to a linear scale by taking the antilog (`10^0.6`).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 3.98.

Understand the Goal and Notation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In stellar astrophysics, this refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen (H), the most abundant element. The goal is to calculate:\nRatio = (n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂\n\nThe problem uses the standard bracket notation for elemental abundances:\n`[X/Y] = log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of elements X and Y.\n\n**2. Identify Careful Points and Key Information**\n\n*   **Key Identity:** A crucial property of this notation is that logarithmic abundances can be combined. The most useful identity for this problem is: `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`. This can be rearranged as needed, for example: `[B/C] = [A/C] - [A/B]`.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides extra information that is not needed for the calculation. This is a common feature in physics and astronomy problems to test understanding. The irrelevant data includes:\n    *   The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 M_sun).\n    *   The method of determination (LTE, EW method).\n    *   The specific absolute abundances of Fe and Mg in the Sun (12 + log₁₀(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5, etc.).\n    The calculation relies only on the relative abundance ratios (`[X/Y]`).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`.\n    We need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]₁`.\n    Using the identity `[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`:\n    `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`.\n    We need to find `[Si/H]₂`.\n    We use the identity `[Mg/H]₂ = [Mg/Si]₂ + [Si/H]₂` and rearrange it to solve for `[Si/H]₂`:\n    `[Si/H]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Mg/Si]₂`\n    `[Si/H]₂ = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the Final Ratio**\n    The ratio we want is `R = (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂`.

In astrophysics, this is interpreted as the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen, the most common element. So, we need to calculate:\nRatio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2\n\nThe problem uses the standard bracket notation for elemental abundances:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of elements X and Y.\n\nA key property derived from this definition, which simplifies calculations, is:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n\nWe can find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]_1`, by applying the identity from Step 1:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe use the same identity: `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`. To find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]_2`, we must rearrange the formula:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio\nThe ratio we want is `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`. The most direct way to find this is to subtract the logarithmic abundances we found in the previous steps.\n\nFrom the definition of `[X/Y]`:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = [log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_sun)] - [log10((n_Si/n_H)_2) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_sun)]`\n\nThe solar abundance term, `log10((n_Si/n_H)_sun)`, cancels out, leaving:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)`:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2 )`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we calculated:\n`log10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the final linear ratio, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of the value):\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n`Ratio ≈ 3.981`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The masses of the stars, the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg, and the observational methods (LTE, EW) are contextual details not required for the mathematical calculation. They are red herrings.\n*   **Correct Identity Usage**: The key is using the identity `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]` and rearranging it correctly for Star 2 (`[Si/H] = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si]`).\n*   **Logarithm Rules**: The final step requires subtracting the logarithmic values (`0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`) and then converting the result back to a linear scale by taking the antilog (`10^0.6`).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 3.98.

For any three elements A, B, and C:\n    `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n    This can be rearranged as needed, for example: `[B/C] = [A/C] - [A/B]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1:**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    Using the identity `[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]`, we can find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star_1:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2:**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    Using the identity `[Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H]`, we can solve for the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star_2:\n    `[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n    `[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    The ratio we want to find, `R = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`, can be found by taking the difference of the logarithmic abundances:\n    `log10(R) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`\n\n    From the definition of `[X/Y]`, we can show that this difference is equal to the difference in the `[Si/H]` values:\n    `log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2`\n\n    Substituting the values from steps 3 and 4:\n    `log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\n    To find the linear ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of the value):\n    `R = 10^0.6`\n\n6.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    `R = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.981`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value `~3.98` is closest to the value in option A.\n    A) ~3.9\n    B) ~1.2\n    C) ~0.8\n    D) ~12.6\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Correct Interpretation:** The phrase \"ratio of silicon atoms\" refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions `(n_Si/n_H)`, not the absolute number of atoms.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The masses of the stars, the method of measurement (LTE, EW), and the specific solar abundances for Fe and Mg are contextual details not required for the calculation. They are included to test understanding of what information is relevant.\n*   **Consistency of Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical result that the ratio is `10^0.6 ≈ 3.98`. The discrepancies in their final answers arise from incorrectly matching this numerical result to the lettered options.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 3.98, which corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, which in astrophysical terms means finding the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen abundance fractions: `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n\nThe calculation relies on the standard definition of elemental abundance notation:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X/n_Y)_sun )`\n\nA key property derived from this definition, used by all candidate answers, is the ability to combine these logarithmic ratios:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n1.  **Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 1, [Si/H]₁.**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`.\n    Using the identity `[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`:\n    `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n2.  **Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 2, [Si/H]₂.**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`.\n    The identity can be written as `[Mg/H]₂ = [Mg/Si]₂ + [Si/H]₂`.\n    To find `[Si/H]₂`, we rearrange the formula: `[Si/H]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Mg/Si]₂`.\n    `[Si/H]₂ = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances.**\n    The ratio `R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n    The logarithm of this ratio can be found by taking the difference of the `[Si/H]` values for each star:\n    `log10(R) = [Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂`\n    `log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n    To find the ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of the value):\n    `R = 10^0.6`\n    `R ≈ 3.981`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options.**\n    The calculated value `R ≈ 3.981` is closest to the value `3.9`.
