    "This problem involves a particle-antiparticle annihilation process. We can solve it by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Annihilation Reaction:**\n    The process is given by:\n    $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this usually implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest before the annihilation.\n    *   This setup corresponds to the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is zero ($P_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   We are given that the mass of particle A is $m_A$, and its rest mass energy is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. It is reasonable to assume $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ have the same mass.\n    *   By the **Law of Conservation of Momentum**, the total final momentum must be zero ($P_{final} = P_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is converted into the total final energy ($E_{final}$) of the four A particles. This final energy includes both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.\n    *   By symmetry, it is logical to assume that the available energy is distributed equally among the four identical product particles. Therefore, each particle A will have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v_A$).\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   We can find the total energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $469.15 \\text{ MeV} = \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{469.15}{300} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we can find the velocity ($v_A$) from the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = 0.7688c$.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\nWe can use a short Python script for a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (proton and antiproton at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# The final state has 4 particles of type A.
