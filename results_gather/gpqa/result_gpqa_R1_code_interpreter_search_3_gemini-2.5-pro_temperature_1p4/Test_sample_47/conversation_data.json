    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   Starting material: Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   Reagent: Bromine (Br₂).\n*   Reaction: This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom will substitute one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n*   Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   Starting material: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   Reagent: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base.\n*   Reaction: An α-halo ketone treated with a strong base can undergo several reactions. The most characteristic reaction for this system is the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate anion performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the three-membered ring opens to relieve ring strain. The bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the more substituted α-carbon (C6) breaks, leading to a more stable carbanion.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (from water) and acidification of the carboxylate salt gives a cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. This ring contraction is a hallmark of the Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   An alternative reaction would be an E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride (Step 3) is much more characteristic for a carboxylic acid than for an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Therefore, the Favorskii rearrangement is the intended pathway.\n*   Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   Starting material: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   Reagents: Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   Reaction: This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride converts the -OH group of the carboxylic acid into a -Cl group. Pyridine is a non-nucleophilic base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   Starting material: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   Reagent: Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   Reaction: This is a specific, sterically hindered, and mild reducing agent. Its primary use is to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes *without* further reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄.\n*   Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4.**\n*   Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure is a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C-H and C=O bonds of the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon of the ring, the C1-H bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   We can count the distinct hydrogen environments (which correspond to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum):\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the proton on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because they are on a prochiral center. This means they are not chemically equivalent to each other. The same is true for the protons on C5. By symmetry, the \"top\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"top\" proton on C5, and the \"bottom\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"bottom\" proton on C5. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **two** distinct signals. (2 types)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are β to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. By symmetry, the four protons on C3 and C4 give rise to **two** distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n*   Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 7\nB) 6\nC) 10\nD) 8\n\nThe calculated number of distinct hydrogen atoms is 6.\n\n<<<B>>>",
