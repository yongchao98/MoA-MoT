    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two different points in a titration curve: at 25% titration (a buffer region) and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted by adding an equal volume of water.\nInitial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\nInitial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm3\nFinal Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\nUsing the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\nThe concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nThe titration reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COO- + Na+ + H2O\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A-). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains. The solution is now a buffer.\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\nFirst, we find the pKa from the given Ka:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\nThe ratio of the concentrations [A-]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n[A-]/[HA] = (moles of A-) / (moles of HA) = 25% / 75% = 1/3\nNow, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH3COO-). We need to find the concentration of this acetate solution.\n*   Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3\n*   Total volume at equivalence point = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L\n*   Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol\n*   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nAcetate is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH- ions:\nCH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\nWe need to find the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.41 x 10^-10\nNow we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, where [CH3COO-]initial = 0.02 M and 'x' is the change in concentration.\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nAssuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n5.41 x 10^-10 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\nx^2 ≈ (5.41 x 10^-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10^-11\nx = [OH-] ≈ sqrt(1.082 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.29 x 10^-6 M\nNow we calculate pOH:\npOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.29 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.48\nFinally, we calculate the pH at 25°C:\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\nLet's verify with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05 # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020 # L\nvol_water = 0.020 # L\nconc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\nfinal_vol_acid_solution = initial_vol_acid + vol_water\nconc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid_solution\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 3: pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_diluted * final_vol_acid_solution\n# Volume of base needed for equivalence\nvol_base_eq = moles_acid / conc_base\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = final_vol_acid_solution + vol_base_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of acetate: Kb = x^2 / [Acetate]\n# We assume x << [Acetate]\noh_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_eq)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(oh_concentration)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe calculation confirms our results.\npH at 25% titration = 4.26\npH at equivalence point = 8.52\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the initial state after dilution**\n\n1.  **Identify the initial substances and their properties.** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid. Its acid dissociation constant, Ka, is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n2.  **Account for the dilution.** We add 20.00 cm³ of water. This doubles the total volume of the solution, so the concentration of the acetic acid will be halved.\n    *   Initial volume of acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n    *   Initial concentration of acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n    *   Final volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we find the new concentration (M₂).\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the pH at 25% titration**\n\n1.  **Define 25% titration.** This means that 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid have reacted with the NaOH titrant. The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O.\n2.  **Recognize the chemical environment.** After 25% of the acid has been neutralized, the solution contains the remaining 75% of the original weak acid (CH₃COOH) and the newly formed 25% of its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). A solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base is a buffer solution.\n3.  **Choose the correct formula.** The pH of a buffer solution is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [conjugate base] / [weak acid] )\n4.  **Calculate pKa.** pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n5.  **Determine the ratio of base to acid.** At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and thus the concentrations) of the conjugate base to the weak acid is 25% to 75%.\n    *   Ratio = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n6.  **Calculate the pH.** Substitute the pKa and the ratio into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\n**Part 3: Calculating the pH at the equivalence point**\n\n1.  **Define the equivalence point.** This is the point where the moles of NaOH added are exactly equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH. All the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution now contains sodium acetate in water.\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of acid.**\n    *   Moles of acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n3.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH required.**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n4.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n5.  **Recognize the chemical environment.** Acetate (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base. It will react with water (hydrolysis) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n6.  **Calculate Kb.** The base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate can be found from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n7.  **Calculate the [OH⁻].** We can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, but a common approximation for weak bases is [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [Base]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * (0.02 M) ) = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n8.  **Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nThese values match option C.

The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base that hydrolyzes water.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of acid and the total volume at equivalence:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume (in L) = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the weak base:**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   First, find the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate using Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Next, calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]. For a weak base, [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n        [OH⁻] = √( (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Now, calculate pOH and then pH.\n        pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
