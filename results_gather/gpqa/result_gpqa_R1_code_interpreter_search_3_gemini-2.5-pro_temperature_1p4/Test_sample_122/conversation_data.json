    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Frame S: The reference frame of the Galaxy. This is considered the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   Frame S': The reference frame of the supernova ejecta. This is the \"moving\" frame relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame), so this is the proper time, `Δτ` (or `Δt'`). `Δτ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by the simple formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy, `Δt`) and the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta, `Δτ`) are related by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δτ`.\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n5.  **Logical Deduction (Qualitative Analysis):**\n    *   Since the ejecta is moving at a relativistic speed (`v > 0`), the Lorentz factor `γ` will be greater than 1.\n    *   This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt = γ * 50 s > 50 s`).\n    *   The classical distance, without considering time dilation, would be `d_classical = v * Δτ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Since the actual time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 s, the actual distance traveled `d = v * Δt` must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n        B) 2,880,000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n        C) 3,000,000 km (the classical, non-relativistic distance)\n        D) 3,060,000 km (greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   Based on this reasoning alone, option D is the only possible answer.\n\n6.  **Quantitative Calculation:**\n    *   Let's perform the exact calculation to confirm.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δτ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ) = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    I will use a Python script for the final computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\ndt_proper = 50  # proper time in seconds\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_proper\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_galaxy=}\")\n```\n\nThe computed distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.
