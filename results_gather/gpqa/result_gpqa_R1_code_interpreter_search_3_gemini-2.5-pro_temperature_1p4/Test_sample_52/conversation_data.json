    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Provided Information**\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups, resulting in a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows the presence of an ester group. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl (C=O) bond and one C-O bond. This adds at least one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial negative constraint, meaning there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons (C6H4). The presence of only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would typically show two doublets.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the rest of the molecule.\n        *   Let's analyze this: In a group like R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3, proton H(b) is split by proton H(a) into a doublet, and it's also split by the three protons of the adjacent -CH3 group into a quartet. This results in a \"doublet of quartets\" for H(b).\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by its neighbor H(b), resulting in a \"doublet\".\n        *   This confirms the presence of a **-CH=CH-CH3** fragment.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal is accounted for by the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since we know there is an ester group and no -CH2- groups, this second methyl must be part of the ester itself. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3).\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule from the following fragments:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n2.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n3.  An ester group containing a methyl group, such as a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**).\n\nLet's combine these fragments to form a complete molecule. A plausible structure would be Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\nStructure: CH3-CH=CH–(C6H4)–COOCH3\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the data:\n*   It has a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   It has an ester group.\n*   It has a propenyl group with the correct vinyl proton splitting.\n*   It has two distinct methyl groups (one on the vinyl group, one on the ester).\n*   It has no -CH2- groups.\n\n**3. Calculating the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, let's calculate the molecular formula for this proposed structure:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in C6H4 ring) + 3 (in propenyl -CH=CH-CH3) + 2 (in methyl ester -COOCH3) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (on C6H4 ring) + 5 (in propenyl -CH=CH-CH3) + 3 (in methyl ester -COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in ester group -COO-) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's check this result against the given options and use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to verify.\nThe DoU of our proposed structure is: 4 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C bond) + 1 (for the C=O bond) = 6.\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This matches our derived formula and structure.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This requires an extra ring or double bond not suggested by the NMR.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DoU is plausible, this formula has an extra CH2 compared to our derived structure. The NMR explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, so this option is incorrect.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This implies one fewer double bond than our structure, which would likely mean the presence of a -CH2- group (e.g., from reducing the propenyl to a propyl group), contradicting the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a systematic approach to piecing together structural fragments from spectroscopic data and then calculating the molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This establishes the core of the molecule as a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a formula of **C6H4**.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an **ester group** (R-COO-R'). This adds two oxygen atoms (O2) and at least one carbon atom to the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This typically gives rise to two distinct signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The signals are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by one neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):**\n        *   One -CH₃ signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl fragment identified above (-CH=CH-**CH₃**).\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-OCH₂CH₃), and the side chain cannot be a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). This confirms the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃).\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule from the following pieces:\n*   A *para*-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH₃** (Formula: C₃H₅)\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group, for example, a methyl ester group: **-COOCH₃** (Formula: C₂H₃O₂)\n\nLet's combine these fragments to build a plausible molecule, such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n**3. Calculating the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester group) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester group) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verifying with Options**\n\nLet's compare this calculated formula with the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This matches our derived formula.\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: This formula contains an extra carbon atom compared to our structure without any additional hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: This formula has an extra -CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The NMR explicitly states there are no -CH₂ signals.\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: This formula has two extra hydrogen atoms, which would imply the loss of a double bond (e.g., converting the propenyl to a propyl group). This would introduce -CH₂ signals, which are absent.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the molecule has a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogens have been replaced. The core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. An ester functional group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. So, the molecular formula must contain **O₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:** This is the most detailed information source.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃), propyl side chains (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), etc.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄) has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly *para* (1,4) substitution, where you would see two distinct signals (each a doublet) for the chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and very specific splitting pattern that points to a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)** attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`.\n        *   The signal for proton H(b) is split by proton H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the three protons of the -CH₃ group into a quartet. This gives the \"doublet of quartets\".\n        *   The signal for proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a \"doublet\".\n        *   This confirms the presence of a **C₃H₅** fragment (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One -CH₃ signal is from the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH₂- groups, this methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, for example, as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). This fragment would have the formula **C₂H₃O₂** (-COOCH₃) or **C₂H₃O₂** (-OCOCH₃).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified all the pieces of the molecule. Let's add them up to find the total formula:\n    *   **C₆H₄** (from the di-substituted benzene ring)\n    *   **C₃H₅** (from the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃)\n    *   **C₂H₃O₂** (from the methyl-containing ester group, e.g., -COOCH₃)\n\n    Now, sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The calculated molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Check Against the Options:**\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A. Let's quickly verify why the others are incorrect.\n    *   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Matches our deduction.\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: Has an extra carbon but no extra hydrogens compared to our structure, which contradicts the NMR.\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: Has an extra CH₂ group compared to our structure. The NMR explicitly states there are no –CH₂ groups.\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: Has two extra hydrogens, which would imply the loss of a double bond. This would almost certainly create a –CH₂ group, which is ruled out.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine the chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the Core Structure:**\nThe problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means the base of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The formula for this core is **C₆H₄**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n*   **FTIR:** An **ester group** is present. An ester (-COO-) contains two oxygen atoms, so the formula will include **O₂**.\n*   **¹H NMR:** This provides the most detailed clues about the substituents.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a very important constraint. It rules out chains like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** This indicates there are two distinct methyl (-CH₃) groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton next to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The proton next to the methyl group is split into a quartet by the methyl group and then into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This confirms the presence of a **C₃H₅** side chain.\n    *   **One -CH₃ accounted for:** The propenyl group accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Second -CH₃ group:** The second methyl signal must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH₂- groups, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃). This ester fragment has the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\nNow, let's sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n*   From the aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   From the propenyl side chain: **C₃H₅**\n*   From the methyl ester group: **C₂H₃O₂**\n\n**Total atoms:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4.

This would likely create a -CH₂- group (e.g., from a propyl instead of a propenyl chain), which is ruled out.\n\nThe only option that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning process to determine the chemical formula is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This tells us the molecule contains a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogens have been replaced.

An ester functional group (R-COO-R') contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the final molecular formula must contain **O₂**.\n\n3.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum in Detail:**\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (-OCH₂CH₃) or side chains containing consecutive CH₂ units.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A C₆H₄ ring has four protons. Two signals suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a characteristic splitting pattern that unambiguously points to a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.
