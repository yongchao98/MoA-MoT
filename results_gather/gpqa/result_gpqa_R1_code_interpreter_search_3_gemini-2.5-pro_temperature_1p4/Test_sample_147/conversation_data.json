Let the formula of A2 be YFₓ. The atomic mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We can now test integer values for x (the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n    *   x=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (closest is Ca, Ar - unlikely)\n    *   x=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.90 (closest is Br, Se - possible)\n    *   x=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (closest is **Antimony (Sb)**, M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   x=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.80 (closest is Dy, Tb - unlikely)\n    *   x=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 (closest is Bi, Au - possible)\n\n    Let's check the candidate Y=Sb and x=3 more precisely. If A2 = SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ωF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making **Y=Sb** and **A2=SbF₃** a very strong hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of Y with Substance A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it can interact with xenon (Xe). The highest fluoride of antimony, formed by direct fluorination, is antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅.\n    Sb + F₂ → **SbF₅ (A3)**\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is famous for its ability to react with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂) to form salts like [XeF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻. This confirms that **Y is indeed Sb** and **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Substance A1.**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and F₂, and it oxidizes Xenon. The decomposition A1 → SbF₃ + F₂ implies A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF₃, likely containing Sb(V). The main Sb(V) fluoride is SbF₅, which is a colorless liquid and decomposes at a much higher temperature. The properties of A1 (color, low-temperature decomposition) do not match a simple antimony fluoride. This part of the problem may describe an exotic complex or contain a deliberate inconsistency, but it does not prevent us from solving the main question about A4. We have enough information to proceed with Y=Sb.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The core of the problem lies here. We are given the following information:\n    *   A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Elemental Y (Sb) is added to this solution in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5.\n    *   The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n\n    Since Sb(0) is a reactant, it must be oxidized, meaning A4 must be or contain an oxidizing agent. Let's examine the possible molecular weights for A4 from the options provided, assuming A4 is an antimony-fluorine compound.\n\n    *   **A) 160-180:** The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 178.76 g/mol, which falls in this range. Could A4 be SbF₃? No. The reaction would be Sb(0) + Sb(III)F₃. Antimony in the +3 oxidation state cannot oxidize elemental antimony. So, A4 ≠ SbF₃.\n    *   **B) 140-160:** A hypothetical SbF₂ would have a mass of ~159.8 g/mol, but this is not a stable compound.\n    *   **C) 110-130:** No simple antimony fluoride has a mass in this range.\n    *   **D) 220-240:** Let's consider other known stable fluorine-containing species of antimony. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a powerful Lewis acid and reacts with HF to form fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆, one of the strongest known superacids. Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n        M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol.\n\n    This molecular weight, **236.77 g/mol**, falls perfectly within the range **220-240**. Fluoroantimonic acid can exist as a colorless, fuming liquid (often as a solution in HF), which fits the description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Most importantly, this system contains Sb(V), which is capable of oxidizing Sb(0) via comproportionation (the equilibrium SbF₅ + HF ⇌ HSbF₆ ensures the presence of the SbF₅ oxidant).\n\n    While the 1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction is not immediately obvious from standard comproportionation reactions (e.g., 2SbF₅ + 3Sb → 5SbF₃), the fact that HSbF₆ is a well-known, relevant chemical whose molecular weight uniquely fits one of the options makes it the only logical choice for A4.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of an element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The formula of A2 can be written as YFₓ, where x is the oxidation state of Y.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    Given M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and ωF = 0.3196:\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for the atomic mass of Y (M(Y)) in terms of x:\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00x - (0.3196 * 19.00x)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45x\n\n    We can test integer values for x to find a chemically plausible element:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, 40.08 g/mol).\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (closest is Br, 79.90 g/mol).\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is known to form multiple fluorides.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (closest is Dy, 162.50 g/mol).\n    *   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (somewhat close to Bi, 208.98 g/mol).\n\n    Let's verify the choice of Y = Sb and x = 3. If A2 is SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ωF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (or 31.88%).\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%, making Y = Sb and **A2 = SbF₃** a very strong conclusion.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    The problem states that A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony with excess fluorine gas produces antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅.\n    Reaction: Sb + (5/2)F₂ → SbF₅\n    SbF₅ is a very powerful Lewis acid and is well-known for its ability to react with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂) to form salts like [XeF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻. This confirms our identification of Y=Sb and establishes **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    This is the main question. We need to find the molecular weight range of A4. Here are the clues for A4:\n    *   It is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Adding elemental antimony (Y = Sb) to the solution of A4 results in a reaction to form A5.\n    *   The reaction Sb + A4 → A5 implies that A4 is an oxidizing agent, as elemental Sb (oxidation state 0) must be oxidized.\n    *   This means A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state, which is Sb(V).\n\n    Let's analyze the options based on these facts:\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₅?** SbF₅ contains Sb(V) and is an oxidant. Its molecular weight is M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the given ranges.\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₃?** SbF₃ is substance A2. Its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which falls in range A) 160-180. However, SbF₃ contains Sb(III) and cannot oxidize elemental Sb(0). So, A4 cannot be SbF₃.\n    *   **Considering the clues again:** \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" and an oxidizing Sb(V) species strongly suggests a superacid system. SbF₅ reacts with hydrogen fluoride (HF) to form **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**. This exists as a colorless, highly reactive solution and is one of the strongest known acids. Although it contains hydrogen, in the context of advanced chemistry problems, it's often considered a primary compound derived from Sb and F.\n\n    Let's calculate the molecular weight of HSbF₆:\n    M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\n    M(HSbF₆) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 1.01 + 121.76 + 114 = **236.77 g/mol**.\n\n    This molecular weight, 236.77 g/mol, falls squarely within the range **D) 220-240**.\n    The reaction of Sb with HSbF₆ is a plausible redox reaction (comproportionation) where Sb(0) is oxidized by the Sb(V) in the superacid.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the chemical properties and molecular weight calculation, substance A4 is best identified as fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆. Its molecular weight of approximately 237 g/mol fits only in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the properties of Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The general formula for this compound is YFₓ.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of an element in a compound is:\n    ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    We are given ωF = 0.3196. So, we can write:\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00 * x) = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We now test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y, to find a corresponding element with a plausible atomic mass:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Argon (Ar, 39.95). Neither is likely to form the compounds described.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90). While Br forms fluorides, the properties do not perfectly align with the rest of the problem.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This value is exceptionally close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is a well-known element that forms multiple fluorides.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.50). This is a rare-earth element and less likely to be the subject of such a problem.\n\n    Let's confirm with Y = Sb and x = 3. The substance A2 would be SbF₃.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is formed by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it can react with xenon. The direct reaction of antimony with excess fluorine gas produces antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅.\n    Sb + (5/2)F₂ → SbF₅\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is famous for reacting with xenon compounds (like XeF₂) to form salts. This confirms that **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Substance A1.**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony than SbF₃, which points to SbF₅. While SbF₅ is typically a colorless liquid, the chemical transformation (A1 → SbF₃ + F₂) is consistent with A1 being SbF₅. The description of color might be a distractor or refer to an impurity or a polymeric form.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    This is the central part of the question. The clues for A4 are:\n    *   It's a component of a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\"\n    *   It reacts with elemental antimony (Y = Sb). This is a redox reaction where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must contain an oxidizing agent.\n    *   This implies A4 must contain antimony in its higher oxidation state, Sb(V).\n\n    Let's examine the options for the molecular weight of A4, assuming it is a compound containing Sb(V):\n    *   The simplest Sb(V) fluoride is SbF₅. Its molecular weight is 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges.\n    *   The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" containing an Sb(V) species strongly suggests the presence of a superacid. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) reacts with hydrogen fluoride (HF) to form **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**, one of the strongest known acids. It exists as a colorless liquid, fitting the description.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of HSbF₆:\n        M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\n        M(HSbF₆) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol.\n\n    This calculated molecular weight of **236.77 g/mol** falls perfectly within the range **D) 220-240**. The presence of Sb(V) in HSbF₆ makes it a powerful oxidant capable of reacting with elemental antimony. Thus, all clues point to A4 being HSbF₆.\n\n<<<D>>>",

Although it contains hydrogen, in the context of advanced chemistry problems, it's often considered a primary compound derived from Sb and F.\n\n    Let's calculate the molecular weight of HSbF₆:\n    M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\n    M(HSbF₆) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 1.01 + 121.76 + 114 = **236.77 g/mol**.\n\n    This molecular weight, 236.77 g/mol, falls squarely within the range **D) 220-240**.\n    The reaction of Sb with HSbF₆ is a plausible redox reaction (comproportionation) where Sb(0) is oxidized by the Sb(V) in the superacid.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the chemical properties and molecular weight calculation, substance A4 is best identified as fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆. Its molecular weight of approximately 237 g/mol fits only in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the properties of Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The general formula for this compound is YFₓ.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of an element in a compound is:\n    ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    We are given ωF = 0.3196. So, we can write:\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00 * x) = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We now test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y, to find a corresponding element with a plausible atomic mass:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Argon (Ar, 39.95). Neither is likely to form the compounds described.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90). While Br forms fluorides, the properties do not perfectly align with the rest of the problem.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This value is exceptionally close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is a well-known element that forms multiple fluorides.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.50). This is a rare-earth element and less likely to be the subject of such a problem.\n\n    Let's confirm with Y = Sb and x = 3. The substance A2 would be SbF₃.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is formed by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it can react with xenon. The direct reaction of antimony with excess fluorine gas produces antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅.\n    Sb + (5/2)F₂ → SbF₅\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is famous for reacting with xenon compounds (like XeF₂) to form salts. This confirms that **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    This is the central part of the question. The clues for A4 are:\n    *   It's a component of a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\"\n    *   It reacts with elemental antimony (Y = Sb). This is a redox reaction where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must contain an oxidizing agent.\n    *   This implies A4 must contain antimony in its higher oxidation state, Sb(V).\n\n    Let's examine the options for the molecular weight of A4, assuming it is a compound containing Sb(V):\n    *   The simplest Sb(V) fluoride is SbF₅. Its molecular weight is 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges.\n    *   The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" containing an Sb(V) species strongly suggests the presence of a superacid. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) reacts with hydrogen fluoride (HF) to form **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**, one of the strongest known acids. It exists as a colorless liquid, fitting the description.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of HSbF₆:\n        M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\n        M(HSbF₆) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol.\n\n    This calculated molecular weight of **236.77 g/mol** falls perfectly within the range **D) 220-240**. The presence of Sb(V) in HSbF₆ makes it a powerful oxidant capable of reacting with elemental antimony. Thus, all clues point to A4 being HSbF₆.\n\n<<<D>>>"
