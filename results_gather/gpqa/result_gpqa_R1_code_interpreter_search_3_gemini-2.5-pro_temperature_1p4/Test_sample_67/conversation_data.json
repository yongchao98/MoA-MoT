This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `H_initial` are `-γB(m_s ħ)`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n    *   To minimize the energy, `m_s` must be `+1/2` (assuming a positive `γ`, as is conventional).

The energy eigenvalues of `H_initial` are `-γB(m_s ħ)`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n    *   To minimize the energy, `m_s` must be `+1/2` (assuming a positive `γ`, as is conventional). Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z>` is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`, this is the initial state vector.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (`t ≥ 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the field is switched to `B_new = B ĵ` in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution of the system, is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time-evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting our Hamiltonian `H`:\n        `U(t) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y / ħ)`\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n        `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n    *   We can expand this exponential operator using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = I cos(θ) + iσ_n sin(θ)`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `θ = γBt/2`.\n    *   The state vector at time `t` becomes:\n        `|ψ(t)> = [I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)] |+z>`\n    *   We know that `σ_y |+z>` gives `i|-z>`. Substituting this:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> + i sin(γBt/2) (i|-z>) = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Moment**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we first calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   `S_z` acts on its eigenstates: `S_z|+z> = +(ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`, etc.), the expression simplifies to:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos²(γBt/2) - (ħ/2)sin²(γBt/2)`\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A function of the form `A cos(ωt)` has an angular frequency of `ω`.\n    *   By inspection, the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation of `<μ_z(t)>` is `γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>"
