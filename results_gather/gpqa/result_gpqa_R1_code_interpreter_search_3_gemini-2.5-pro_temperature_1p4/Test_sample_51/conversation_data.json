    "This problem requires us to calculate the change in the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms under two different temperature conditions of a star's photosphere. The relationship between the population of energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation, assuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### **1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (1 and 2):\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₁, N₂ are the number of atoms in energy levels 1 and 2.\n*   g₁, g₂ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   E₁, E₂ are the energies of the levels. The difference (E₂ - E₁) is the energy of the transition.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### **2. Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios**\n\nWe are comparing two scenarios for the star:\n1.  **No Spots:** The effective temperature of the photosphere is T_nospots = 6000 K.\n2.  **With Spots:** The overall effective temperature of the photosphere is T_spots = 5500 K.\n\nLet's define the population ratio for each case:\n*   Ratio_nospots = (N₂ / N₁) at T = 6000 K\n    Ratio_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)]\n\n*   Ratio_spots = (N₂ / N₁) at T = 5500 K\n    Ratio_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)]\n\nThe problem states that astronomers observe the overall properties of the star, so we use the overall effective temperatures provided for each case. The other stellar parameters (radius, mass, spot coverage) are context to explain why the effective temperature changes, but are not needed for the core calculation.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Factor of Change**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the two ratios calculated above:\n\nFactor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots\n\nFactor = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)] }\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n\nFactor = exp[ - (E₂ - E₁)/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n### **4. Determine the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁)**\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å).\n\nE₂ - E₁ = ΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n### **5. Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the equation for the factor. We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values\nT_nospots = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spots = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in K\nwavelength = 1448e-10 # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (E2 - E1)\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength\n\n# Calculate the term in the exponent\nexponent = -(delta_E / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n\n```\nRunning this code gives the following output:\n```\nfactor=4.50645068202166\n```\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This problem requires calculating the factor by which the population ratio of two atomic energy levels changes when the temperature of the star's photosphere changes. The key physical principle is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### **1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nAssuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the population of two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (kT)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### **2. Ratios at Two Different Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find this population ratio for two different temperatures:\n*   **T_nospots = 6000 K** (when the star has no spots)\n*   **T_spots = 5500 K** (when the star has spots)\n\nLet's write the ratio for each case:\n*   Ratio_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]\n*   Ratio_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\n\n### **3. The Factor of Change**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of the two ratios:\n\nFactor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots\n\nFactor = [(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) is constant for the given transition and cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\n\nUsing the exponent rule eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we can simplify the expression:\n\nFactor = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n\n### **4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å. We can find this using the Planck-Einstein relation: ΔE = hc/λ.\n\n*   h (Planck's constant) = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) = 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n### **5. Calculation**\n\nWe can now substitute all the known values. It is best to use a script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given Parameters\nT_nospots = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spots = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in K\nwavelength = 1448e-10 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E)\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength\n\n# Calculate the term in the exponent\nexponent_term = (-delta_E / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent_term)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\nThe output of this calculation is `factor=4.50645...`, which is approximately 4.5.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the number of atoms in the two energy levels is about 4.5 times higher when the star is hotter (no spots) compared to when it is cooler (with spots).\n\n<<<B>>>"
