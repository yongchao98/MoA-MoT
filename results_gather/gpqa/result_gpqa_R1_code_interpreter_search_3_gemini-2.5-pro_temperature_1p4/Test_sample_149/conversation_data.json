    "**1. Deciphering the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the provided 1H-NMR data to determine the structure of the initial compound.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for a saturated acyclic amine with 8 carbons is C8H(2*8+1+1)N = C8H18N. The given formula is C8H9NO.\n    *   Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE) = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A value of 5 suggests a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one other double bond (1 DBE), which is consistent with a C=O group.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, t -> n=2), suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d) because its two protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, d -> n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift is appropriate for protons on a carbon attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (benzylic and alpha to a carbonyl).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The different chemical shifts are due to the electronic effects of the two different substituents.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH2), and a phenylacetaldehyde (-CH2-CHO) fragment. Combining these pieces, the only possible structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify its formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a standard **diazotization reaction**. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures) to form a diazonium salt.\n    The -NH2 group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *Product after Step 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride (or 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride).\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat**\n    The diazonium salt is then treated with water and heated. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is displaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (hydrolysis).\n    *Product after Step 2:* **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Mechanism of Aldol Condensation:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻ from KOH) acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O`\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `[HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO → Intermediate alkoxide`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The intermediate alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n            *Addition Product:* `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(C₆H₄OH)-CHO`, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and the H from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This dehydration is highly favorable as it creates a stable, conjugated system.\n            `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(C₆H₄OH)-CHO --(Heat)--> HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄OH)-CHO + H₂O`\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    The structure of the final condensation product is `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄OH)-CHO`.\n    Let's name this compound according to IUPAC rules:\n    - The parent chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde, C=C double bond).\n    - The aldehyde is C1, and the double bond starts at C2, so it's a `but-2-enal`.\n    - There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C2.\n    - There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C4.\n    - The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\nBecause the reaction is heated, the condensation (dehydration) step is expected to go to completion, making the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde the final major product, not the simple aldol addition product.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, formed before dehydration. Not the final product under heat.\nB) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and molecular formula.\nC) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct aldol *condensation* product, favored by heat.\nD) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (missing the hydroxyl groups).\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the Starting Compound (C8H9NO)**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the starting material using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`\n    For C8H9NO: `DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5`\n    A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, typically a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal above 9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (`n+1` rule, `2+1=3` peaks). This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is in the region for a methylene group (`-CH2-`). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (`1+1=2` peaks). This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, as this `-CH2-` is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift suggests it is benzylic (attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This `AA'BB'` pattern is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine group (`-NH2`).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-NH2, -CH2CHO, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring), the structure of the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n    Let's verify its molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This is correct.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we trace the reactions starting with 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n1.  **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The `-NH2` group is converted to `-N₂⁺Cl⁻`.\n    The product is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt)**\n    The diazonium salt is unstable and, upon warming in water, the `-N₂⁺` group (a very good leaving group) is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This is the final step. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on its α-carbon (the `-CH2-` group). When treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** A base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This is followed by protonation to yield a β-hydroxy aldehyde, also known as an aldol addition product.\n        *   Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (A).\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is **heated**, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The `-OH` group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The new double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, making this dehydration product very stable and the expected final product.\n        *   The structure of this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's check the proposed final structure against the options:\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, not the final *condensation* product formed under heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the correct name for the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure (lacks the -OH groups).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation under heat to give the final dehydrated product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>",
