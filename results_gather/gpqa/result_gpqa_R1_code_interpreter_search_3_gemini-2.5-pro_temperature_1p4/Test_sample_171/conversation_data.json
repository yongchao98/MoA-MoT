    "This problem can be solved using the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy levels when a system is in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nFor a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_b$) in an excited energy state 'b' to the number of atoms ($N_a$) in a lower energy state 'a' is given by:\n\n$N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T))$\n\nwhere:\n*   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the respective energy levels.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n*   $T$ is the absolute temperature of the system.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nWe are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. Let's write the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of the same two iron energy levels in each star:\n\nFor star_1:\n$(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_1))$\n\nFor star_2:\n$(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_2))$\n\n**3. Using the Information from the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 compared to star_2:\n\n$(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2$\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:\n\n$(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_2))]$\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, $(g_b / g_a)$, is the same on both sides and cancels out:\n\n$exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_2))$\n\n**4. Solving for the Temperatures**\n\nTo solve this, we can rearrange the equation and take the natural logarithm:\n\n$exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_1)) / exp(-\\Delta E / (k*T_2)) = 2$\n\nUsing the property of exponents ($e^x / e^y = e^{x-y}$):\n\n$exp((\\Delta E / (k*T_2)) - (\\Delta E / (k*T_1))) = 2$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n$ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n\n**5. Substituting the Given Values**\n\nThe problem gives the energy difference $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J. The Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.  Therefore, the pre-factor is:\n\n$\\Delta E / k \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) = 1 K$\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\n$ln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n\n**6. Final Simplification**\n\nNow we combine the terms in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator, which is $T_1*T_2$:\n\n$ln(2) = (T_1 / (T_1*T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1*T_2))$\n\n$ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
