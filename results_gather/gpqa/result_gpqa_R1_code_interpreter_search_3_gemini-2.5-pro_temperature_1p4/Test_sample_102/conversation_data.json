    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nLet's draw the structure and identify the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\n```\n      COCH3 (at C1)\n      / \\\n     |   |\n(C6) -- -- (C2)\n    |     |\n(C5) -- -- (C3)\n     \\ /    \\\n     NO2     Br\n```\n\nKey observation: All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to a benzene ring is crucial, as existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nTo achieve an all-meta substitution pattern (1,3,5), a good strategy is to start by introducing a *meta*-directing group. This will direct the second substituent to the meta position (C3). Then, the two groups will direct the third substituent.\n\nPossible starting *meta*-directors are the acetyl group or the nitro group. Let's explore starting with an acetyl group.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. This introduces the -COCH3 group, which is a meta-director. This is a very good first step.\n\n*   **Step 2: Introduce the next two groups (Br and NO2).** We have two options for the second step: bromination or nitration.\n    *   **Path A: Nitration first.** Acetophenone is nitrated (HNO3/H2SO4). The meta-directing acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 3, forming 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   **Path B: Bromination first.** Acetophenone is brominated (Br2/FeBr3). The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine atom to position 3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Introduce the final group.**\n    *   **Following Path A:** We need to brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring now has two groups: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are strong *meta*-directors.\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -NO2 group directs to C5.\n        Since both groups direct the incoming bromine to the same position (C5), this reaction should be clean and high-yield, producing the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the sequence **Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination** is an excellent route.\n\n    *   **Following Path B:** We need to nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two groups: -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C3).\n        *   The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director and directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director and directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        The directors are in conflict. However, the positions ortho/para to bromine (C2, C4, C6) are also ortho/para to the strongly deactivating acetyl group, making them less reactive. The position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is therefore favored, even though it is also meta to the bromine. This reaction is known to produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. So, the sequence **Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration** is also a viable route.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine which of the given options matches a viable synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence generates aniline in step (ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n    This sequence creates benzenediazonium chloride (iii) and then converts it back to benzene (iv). This is a circular and unproductive synthesis. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    Step (ii) produces p-bromonitrobenzene (major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The ring is extremely deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups, so this reaction is infeasible under normal conditions. Moreover, even if it worked, the directing effects would yield 2-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the wrong isomer. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence correspond exactly to Path B discussed above:\n    *   i) **Acylation:** Benzene -> Acetophenone\n    *   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone\n    *   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n    This is a chemically sound sequence that produces the target molecule as the major product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as they would modify or destroy the target molecule already formed. However, since options A, B, and D contain fundamental chemical errors in their core synthesis, Option C represents the only viable route among the choices. It is common in such questions to find the correct synthetic core embedded within a longer, distracting sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the incorrect options based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry, we are left with Option C as the only plausible choice. The initial three steps of Option C describe a valid synthesis for 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, we must analyze the structure of the target molecule and consider the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of reactions is crucial because existing substituents on a benzene ring direct the position of new substituents.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a ***meta***-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a ***meta***-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an ***ortho, para***-director.\n\n**3. Devise a Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the all-*meta* (1,3,5) substitution pattern, it is most effective to introduce a *meta*-directing group first. Both the acetyl group and the nitro group are *meta*-directors. Introducing an *ortho, para*-director like bromine first would make it very difficult to place the next two groups in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\nLet's start by introducing a *meta*-director. The Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the acetyl group is an excellent first step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.**\n    Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step 2: Add the second group (Bromo or Nitro).**\n    Now we have acetophenone, with the -COCH₃ group at position 1.\n    *   **Path 1 (Bromination):** React acetophenone with Br₂/FeBr₃. The *meta*-directing acetyl group will direct the bromine to position 3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Path 2 (Nitration):** React acetophenone with HNO₃/H₂SO₄. The *meta*-directing acetyl group will direct the nitro group to position 3, forming 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    Both paths are viable at this stage.\n\n*   **Step 3: Add the third group.**\n    *   **Following Path 1 (starting from 3-bromoacetophenone):** We need to nitrate this molecule. We have an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at C1 (a *meta*-director) and a bromo group (-Br) at C3 (an *ortho, para*-director).\n        *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        However, the positions ortho and para to the acetyl group (2, 4, 6) are highly deactivated. The directing influence of the acetyl group is stronger, and both deactivating groups will favor substitution at position 5. Thus, nitration yields the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The sequence is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.**\n\n    *   **Following Path 2 (starting from 3-nitroacetophenone):** We need to brominate this molecule. We have an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at C1 and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3. Both are strong *meta*-directors.\n        *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -Br group to position 5.\n        *   The -NO₂ group also directs the incoming -Br group to position 5.\n        Since both groups direct the new substituent to the same position, this reaction works very well to form the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The sequence is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination.**\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow we check which option matches a valid synthetic route.\n\n*   **A)** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails because the amine's lone pair complexes with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B)** This sequence produces aniline (ii), converts it to a diazonium salt (iii), and then reduces it back to benzene (iv). This is unproductive. **Incorrect.**\n*   **C)** The first three steps are:\n    i) `CH3COCl/AlCl3`: Acylation (Benzene → Acetophenone)\n    ii) `Br2/FeBr3`: Bromination (Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone)\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration (3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one)\n    This three-step sequence perfectly matches the \"Path 1\" we identified above and successfully yields the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct initial synthesis. **Correct.**\n*   **D)** Starts with bromination, followed by nitration to give mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii), a Friedel-Crafts acylation, will not work on this strongly deactivated ring. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, the sequence in option C provides a valid and high-yield pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to devise a synthetic route from benzene to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent chain:** An ethanone attached to a phenyl group (this is an acetophenone derivative).\n*   **Substituents on the phenyl ring:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Review the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical.\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a ***meta***-director.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an ***ortho, para***-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a ***meta***-director.\n\n**3. Devise a Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the most logical strategy is to start by introducing a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to the correct position (position 3). Then, the two existing substituents will direct the third.\n\nLet's start with a Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.**\n    *   Benzene reacts with `CH₃COCl` in the presence of `AlCl₃` to form acetophenone. This introduces the acetyl group (-COCH₃), which is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step 2: Introduction of the second substituent.**\n    *   We can either brominate or nitrate the acetophenone. Let's follow the sequence in option C.\n    *   **Bromination:** Acetophenone is reacted with `Br₂/FeBr₃`. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine atom to position 3, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Introduction of the third substituent.**\n    *   **Nitration:** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone using `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`. The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ at C1 (*meta*-director) and -Br at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n        *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In this case, the position jointly activated by the *ortho, para*-director (-Br) and deactivated by the *meta*-director (-COCH₃) is C5, which is *meta* to both. The strong deactivating nature of the acetyl group at C1 makes positions 2, 4, and 6 less reactive. Therefore, nitration will occur primarily at position 5, yielding the desired product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ...**: This route creates aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails on aniline because the amine's lone pair reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and then back to benzene. This is a chemically pointless loop. **Incorrect.**\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: This sequence follows the exact logic we worked out:\n    1.  **Acylation** of benzene to acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination** of acetophenone to give 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration** of 3-bromoacetophenone to give the target molecule.\n    This is a valid and efficient synthetic route. The subsequent steps listed in the option (iv-vii) are irrelevant as the target molecule is already formed. **Correct.**\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This route starts with bromination, followed by nitration, which yields mainly *p*-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii), Friedel-Crafts acylation, will not work on a ring that is strongly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. **Incorrect.**\n\nTherefore, the only viable sequence of reactions is presented in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

It directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict, but the positions ortho/para to the strong deactivating acetyl group are very unreactive.
