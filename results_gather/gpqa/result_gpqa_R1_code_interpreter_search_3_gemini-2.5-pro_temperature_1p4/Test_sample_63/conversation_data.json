    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B decomposes upon heating into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)₂):** This substance is a powerful dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (it would form a white precipitate of CaCO₃). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the copper is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) that reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of atomic Oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂) in the gas phase, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to water absorption, basic solution, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n*   0.2 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.1 mol N₂\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the products and see if it equals the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g (given)\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our identification and quantification of the products are correct.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n\nSince the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts A and B must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N) atoms. The total mass is accounted for by these elements, so there are no other elements (like metals) in the salts. This indicates they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of H:** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total H = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H atoms.\n*   **Moles of N:** All nitrogen is in the 0.1 mol of N₂.\n    *   Total N = 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N atoms.\n*   **Moles of O:** Oxygen is present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Total O = (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe most common ammonium salts containing only N, H, and O are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   Salt A = Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n    *   Molar Mass = 2(14) + 4(1) + 3(16) = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Salt B = Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Molar Mass = 2(14) + 4(1) + 2(16) = 28 + 4 + 32 = 64 g/mol.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles of A and B. Let this be 'n' moles for each.\n*   Total mass = n × M(A) + n × M(B) = 7.20 g\n*   n × (80 g/mol + 64 g/mol) = 7.20 g\n*   n × (144 g/mol) = 7.20 g\n*   n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 5: Check if the decomposition of these amounts yields the observed products.**\n\nThe decomposition reactions at ~200°C are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nLet's calculate the products from our amounts (n=0.05 mol):\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃:\n    *   The reaction stoichiometry is 2:2:1:4. So, 0.05 mol will produce:\n    *   (0.05 / 2) × 2 = 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   (0.05 / 2) × 1 = 0.025 mol O₂\n    *   (0.05 / 2) × 4 = 0.1 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products from both reactions:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (from nitrite) + 0.05 mol (from nitrate) = 0.1 mol. (Matches our finding)\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol (from nitrate). (Matches our finding)\n*   Total H₂O = 0.1 mol (from nitrite) + 0.1 mol (from nitrate) = 0.2 mol. (Matches our finding)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes a series of reactions that help us identify the gases formed when the salt mixture is heated.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to water absorption, reaction with a base, and reaction with hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nThe decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture yielded:\n*   0.2 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.1 mol N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are composed of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Therefore, the original salts A and B must contain only these elements. Since they are salts and contain no metal, they must be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from the 0.1 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe most common ammonium salts containing only N, H, and O are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 80 g/mol)\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass ≈ 64 g/mol)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains the same number of moles (`n`) of each salt.\nTotal mass = (moles of A × Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B × Molar Mass of B)\n7.20 g = n × (80 g/mol) + n × (64 g/mol)\n7.20 g = n × (144 g/mol)\nn = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Hypothesis with Decomposition Reactions**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of these amounts of salts produces the calculated quantities of gases. The relevant decomposition reactions at this temperature are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (Reaction 1):\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol of N₂\n    *   Produces 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol of H₂O\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (Reaction 2):\n    *   Produces (0.05 mol / 2) × 2 = 0.05 mol of N₂\n    *   Produces (0.05 mol / 2) × 1 = 0.025 mol of O₂\n    *   Produces (0.05 mol / 2) × 4 = 0.1 mol of H₂O\n\n*   **Total Products:**\n    *   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (**Matches**)\n    *   O₂ = 0.025 mol (**Matches**)\n    *   H₂O = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (**Matches**)\n\nThe identification of the salts as ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>",

NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (using reaction 1):\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol of N₂\n    *   Produces 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol of H₂O\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (using reaction 2):\n    *   Moles of N₂ = (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) × (2 mol N₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Moles of O₂ = (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) × (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = 0.025 mol O₂\n    *   Moles of H₂O = (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) × (4 mol H₂O / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = 0.1 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Total Products:**\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (from nitrite) + 0.05 mol (from nitrate) = 0.1 mol (**Matches**)\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol (from nitrate) = 0.025 mol (**Matches**)\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.1 mol (from nitrite) + 0.1 mol (from nitrate) = 0.2 mol (**Matches**)\n\nThe calculations confirm that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Gas Absorption Data to Identify Products**\n\nThe problem describes a chemical analysis of the gases produced when the salt mixture is heated. We can identify each gaseous product and its quantity from the mass changes in the successive tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of atomic oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nIn summary, the decomposition of 7.20 g of the salt mixture produced 0.2 mol of H₂O, 0.025 mol of O₂, and 0.1 mol of N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Original Salts**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are composed only of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. This means the original salts A and B must also be composed of these three elements. As they are salts that decompose fully into gases, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common possibilities are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We are told the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles (`n`) of each salt.\n\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass = 80.0 g/mol)\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass = 64.0 g/mol)\n\nThe total mass is the sum of the masses of each salt:\nTotal Mass = (`n` × M_A) + (`n` × M_B)\n7.20 g = `n` × (80.0 g/mol + 64.0 g/mol)\n7.20 g = `n` × 144.0 g/mol\n\nWe can calculate `n`:\n```python\nn = 7.20 / 144.0\nprint(n)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is `n = 0.05`. This means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Decomposition Products**\n\nNow we check if the decomposition of these quantities of salt matches our findings from Step 1. The thermal decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (using reaction 1):\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   Produces 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol of H₂O.\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (using reaction 2):\n    *   Produces (0.05 / 2) × 2 = 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   Produces (0.05 / 2) × 1 = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   Produces (0.05 / 2) × 4 = 0.1 mol of H₂O.\n\nAdding the products from both reactions:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (**Matches**).\n*   Total O₂ = 0 + 0.025 = 0.025 mol (**Matches**).\n*   Total H₂O = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (**Matches**).\nThe hypothesis is confirmed.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
