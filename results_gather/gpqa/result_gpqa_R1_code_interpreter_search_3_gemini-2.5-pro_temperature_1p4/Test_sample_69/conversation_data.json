    "This is a complex chemical puzzle that requires identifying several unknown substances (A through H) based on a series of reaction clues. The ultimate goal is to determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)\n    *   **Clue 4:** D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n\n2.  **Deconstruct Clue 3:** This is the most chemically restrictive clue. The hydrolysis of product C regenerates the starting solid A and produces two different acids: one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The regeneration of A suggests that C is a compound where A is a central, stable core.\n    *   The formation of two different acids implies that the parts of C that are hydrolyzed contain at least two different non-metallic elements that form acids. A common pair of acids with different strengths is a strong hydrohalic acid (like HCl) and a weak one (HF).\n    *   This leads to the hypothesis that F = HCl (strong acid) and G = HF (weak acid). Therefore, compound C must contain Chlorine and Fluorine atoms in its structure, in addition to the central component A.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Clue 4:** A 1:1 reaction between two gases, D and B, forms a solvent H. This points towards a simple addition reaction.\n    *   Following the lead from Clue 3 (presence of Cl and F), let's consider gases containing these elements. Let's test the hypothesis that B is **Chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃)**, a gas above 11.75 °C. Let's test D as **Hydrogen fluoride (HF)**, a gas above 19.5 °C.\n    *   Reaction: HF(g) + ClF₃(g) -> [ClF₂]⁺[HF₂]⁻ or a similar adduct, H[ClF₄]. Such adducts exist and can function as superacid/fluorinating solvents. So, let's tentatively identify:\n        *   **B = ClF₃**\n        *   **D = HF**\n        *   **H = an adduct of HF and ClF₃**\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate Clue 3 with the new identities:** C + H₂O -> A + HCl + HF.\n    *   This confirms our choice of acids. Now, what is A? Since B is ClF₃ and the hydrolysis products include HCl and HF, C must be a complex formed from A and ClF₃. The hydrolysis of ClF₃ itself produces HCl and HF (`ClF₃ + 2H₂O → 3HF + HCl + O₂`).\n    *   For A to be reformed, it must be a stable species that can coordinate ClF₃ and then be released upon hydrolysis. A very stable solid oxide that comes to mind in the context of fluorine chemistry is **Uranium dioxide (UO₂) **. The uranyl ion (UO₂²⁺) is exceptionally stable.\n    *   Let's hypothesize **A = UO₂**. UO₂ is a solid.\n    *   The hydrolysis of a complex containing a UO₂ core and ClF₃-derived ligands would release the stable UO₂ core and hydrolyze the ligands to HCl and HF. This is a consistent picture.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Clue 1:** A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red).\n    *   This becomes: UO₂(s) + 8ClF₃(g) -> C(bright red).\n    *   Uranium compounds are frequently colored. It is known that UO₂ reacts with ClF₃ to form complexes. While the 1:8 stoichiometry is unusual and may be an error in the puzzle's common transcription, a red complex (C) formed from UO₂ and ClF₃ is plausible. For the purpose of solving the puzzle, we will assume such a complex C exists. A possible (though simplified) structure could be a salt involving the uranyl core and ions derived from ClF₃, like `[ClF₂]⁺` and `[F]⁻`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Clue 2 to find E:** C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous).\n    *   This becomes: C (the red UO₂-ClF₃ complex) + 2HF(g) -> E.\n    *   We are reacting the complex with excess HF. This will likely cause ligand exchange, breaking down the complex and forming a simpler, stable uranium fluoride compound. The most stable and common end-product of fluorinating uranium oxides is Uranyl fluoride.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **E = UO₂F₂** (Uranyl fluoride).\n    *   Is UO₂F₂ \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes, like most soluble uranium compounds, it is highly toxic and radioactive. This fits the description.\n\n7.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   We have identified E as Uranyl fluoride, **UO₂F₂**.\n    *   To find its molecular symmetry group, we need to know its molecular geometry. The central Uranium atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms and two fluorine atoms.\n    *   A simple Lewis structure might suggest a planar D2h geometry, but experimental evidence from gas-phase electron diffraction shows a different structure. The O=U=O atoms form a bent group (angle ~100-110°) and the F-U-F atoms also form a bent group (angle ~90-100°). The molecule has a twofold rotation axis (C₂) that bisects both the O-U-O and F-U-F angles, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain this axis.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Based on the step-by-step deduction, the extremely hazardous product E is UO₂F₂, which has a molecular symmetry of C2v. This corresponds to option A.\n\nSummary of Identities:\n*   A = UO₂ (Uranium dioxide)\n*   B = ClF₃ (Chlorine trifluoride)\n*   C = A red complex of UO₂ and ClF₃\n*   D = HF (Hydrogen fluoride)\n*   E = UO₂F₂ (Uranyl fluoride)\n*   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G = HF (Hydrofluoric acid)\n*   H = Adduct of HF and ClF₃\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (UO₂F₂) is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a chemical puzzle. Let's deduce the identities of the compounds step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`**\n    *   The hydrolysis of compound C regenerates the starting solid A and produces two different acids, one strong and one weak.\n    *   A very common pair of acids with differing strengths are hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and hydrofluoric acid (HF, weak).\n    *   This strongly suggests that **F is HCl** and **G is HF**.\n    *   Therefore, compound C must contain both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio)**\n    *   Following from step 1, the gases B and D are likely the sources of the Cl and F.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that gas **D is HF** (Hydrogen fluoride, gas above 19.5 °C).\n    *   And gas **B is ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride, a powerful fluorinating agent and gas above 11.75 °C).\n    *   The reaction `HF + ClF₃` is known to form adducts which can be used as specialized solvents. This hypothesis is consistent with the clues.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`**\n    *   Substituting our identified gas B, the reaction is `A(s) + 8ClF₃(g) -> C(bright red)`.\n    *   A is a solid that reacts with the extremely powerful agent ClF₃. The fact that A is reformed upon hydrolysis (Clue 3) suggests it's a very stable chemical core. The color \"bright red\" points towards a transition metal or actinide compound.\n    *   A very stable solid oxide is **Uranium dioxide (UO₂) **. The uranyl ion (UO₂²⁺) is famously stable. Let's assume **A = UO₂**.\n    *   So, C is a complex formed from the reaction of UO₂ with ClF₃. Its exact stoichiometry is complex, but its identity as a Uranium-Oxy-Chloro-Fluoride complex is firm. The hydrolysis regenerating the stable UO₂ core is chemically sound.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: `C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`**\n    *   Substituting our identified species, this becomes: `C(Uranium complex) + 2HF(g) -> E`.\n    *   Reacting the complex C with excess HF will drive the reaction towards the simplest, most stable uranium oxyfluoride product. This would be **Uranyl fluoride, UO₂F₂**.\n    *   Is UO₂F₂ extremely hazardous? Yes, as a soluble uranium compound, it is both highly toxic and radioactive. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   So, we identify **E = UO₂F₂**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (UO₂F₂)**\n    *   The final step is to determine the point group of the UO₂F₂ molecule.\n    *   The central atom is U. It is bonded to two O atoms (as the uranyl group, O=U=O) and two F atoms.\n    *   While the `[O=U=O]²⁺` ion is linear on its own, the addition of the two F ligands causes the molecule to adopt a bent, or \"cis\", configuration in the gas phase.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry elements of this structure:\n        *   There is a twofold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the U atom and bisects both the O-U-O and F-U-F angles.\n        *   There are two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the O-U-O atoms, and the other contains the F-U-F atoms.\n    *   A molecule that possesses one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E (UO₂F₂) is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Acids (Clue 3):** The reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)` is the most revealing clue. The formation of two different acids from hydrolysis points towards a compound containing at least two different non-metals that form acids. A classic and very common pair of acids with a significant difference in strength is **hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong)** and **hydrofluoric acid (HF, weak)**. Therefore, we can confidently identify:\n    *   **F = HCl**\n    *   **G = HF**\n\n2.  **Identify the Gases (Clue 4):** Since the hydrolysis of C yields HCl and HF, the precursor compounds B and D must be the source of the chlorine and fluorine. Clue 4 states `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Based on our identification of the acids, a logical candidate for gas D is **hydrogen fluoride (HF)**, which is a gas above 19.5 °C.\n    *   Gas B must contain chlorine and likely fluorine. A common gaseous interhalogen compound is **chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃)**, a gas above 11.75 °C. It is a potent fluorinating and chlorinating agent.\n    *   The reaction `HF + ClF₃` can form adducts like H[ClF₄], which can act as specialized ionizing solvents. This perfectly matches the description of H.\n    *   So, we identify:\n        *   **B = ClF₃**\n        *   **D = HF**\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Compound (Clue 1 & 3):** Now we analyze the first clue: `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`.\n    *   We know B is ClF₃. The reaction is `A(s) + 8ClF₃(g) -> C(bright red)`.\n    *   From Clue 3, we know that C hydrolyzes to reform the solid A. This indicates that A is a very stable chemical core that is complexed by ligands derived from ClF₃ to form C.\n    *   The \"bright red\" color is characteristic of many transition metal and actinide compounds. Given the use of ClF₃, an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, the chemistry of actinides like Uranium is a strong possibility. A very stable solid uranium compound is **Uranium dioxide (UO₂) **. The uranyl ion (UO₂²⁺) is exceptionally stable and is often preserved through reactions.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify **A = UO₂**. Product C is a complex of UO₂ with ClF₃.\n\n4.  **Identify the Hazardous Product (Clue 2):** The final reaction is `C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Substituting our identified species: `(UO₂-ClF₃ complex) + 2HF(g) -> E`.\n    *   Reacting the complex C with excess HF would drive the reaction to completion, forming the simplest and most thermodynamically stable uranium oxyfluoride. This product is **Uranyl fluoride (UO₂F₂) **.\n    *   Is UO₂F₂ \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes. As a soluble uranium compound, it is both highly toxic (a heavy metal poison) and radioactive. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   We identify **E = UO₂F₂**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The final task is to find the molecular symmetry group of E (Uranyl fluoride, UO₂F₂).\n    *   The structure of UO₂F₂ in the gas phase features a central uranium (U) atom. The two oxygen atoms form a bent `O-U-O` group, and the two fluorine atoms form a bent `F-U-F` group. The molecule adopts a `cis` configuration.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry elements of this structure:\n        *   There is one twofold (C₂) axis of rotation that passes through the U atom, bisecting both the O-U-O and F-U-F angles.\n        *   There are two mirror planes (σᵥ) that are perpendicular to each other and contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the U, O, and O atoms. The other plane contains the U, F, and F atoms.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a chemical puzzle that requires deducing the identity of several substances. The key is to work backward from the most chemically specific clues.\n\n1.  **Start with Clue 3: `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`**\n    This clue is the most informative. The hydrolysis of compound C yields two different acids, one strong and one weak. The most common and well-known example of such a pair is **HCl (Hydrochloric acid, strong)** and **HF (Hydrofluoric acid, weak)**.\n    *   Therefore, we can deduce: **F = HCl** and **G = HF**.\n    *   This implies that compound **C** must contain both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F).\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)`**\n    Since C contains Cl and F, the reactant gases B and D must be their source.\n    *   Based on our deduction from Clue 3, a logical choice for gas **D** is **HF** (Hydrogen fluoride, a gas above 19.5 °C).\n    *   Consequently, gas **B** must contain chlorine. A common gaseous fluorinating agent containing chlorine is **ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride, a gas above 11.75 °C).\n    *   The reaction `HF + ClF₃` forms adducts which can be used as specialized solvents. This fits the description of **H**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`**\n    Now we can substitute our identification of B: `A(s) + 8ClF₃(g) -> C(bright red)`.\n    *   From Clue 3, we know that the solid **A** is regenerated upon hydrolysis of C. This suggests A is a very stable core. The reaction involves ClF₃, an extremely powerful fluorinating agent often used in processing nuclear fuel. This, along with the \"bright red\" color, points towards an actinide compound. A very stable solid in this context is **Uranium dioxide (UO₂) **.\n    *   Therefore, we identify **A = UO₂**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: `C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`**\n    Let's substitute the identities of C (a complex of UO₂ and ClF₃) and D (HF): `(UO₂-complex) + 2HF(g) -> E`.\n    *   The reaction of the uranium complex with excess hydrogen fluoride (HF) will lead to the formation of the most stable simple uranium oxyfluoride. This product is **Uranyl fluoride (UO₂F₂) **.\n    *   Uranyl fluoride is a soluble uranium compound, making it both highly toxic and radioactive. This fits the description \"extremely hazardous\" perfectly.\n    *   So, we identify **E = UO₂F₂**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (UO₂F₂)**\n    The final step is to determine the point group for the UO₂F₂ molecule.\n    *   In the gas phase, the molecule is not linear or planar. The central Uranium (U) atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms and two fluorine atoms. The `O=U=O` group is bent, and the `F-U-F` group is also bent, arranged in a *cis* configuration.\n    *   The symmetry elements for this shape are:\n        *   A single C₂ rotational axis that bisects both the O-U-O and F-U-F angles.\n        *   Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the UO₂ part of the molecule, and the other contains the UF₂ part.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically deducing the identity of each unknown substance.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   This is the most revealing clue. A single compound, C, hydrolyzes to form two different acids, one strong and one weak. The most common and textbook example of such a pair is **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, which is a strong acid, and **hydrofluoric acid (HF)**, which is a weak acid.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify **F = HCl** and **G = HF**.\n    *   This also tells us that compound **C** must contain both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: The Reactant Gases**\n    *   `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since C contains Cl and F, the reactant gases B and D must be their source.\n    *   Based on our previous deduction, a logical choice for gas **D** is **HF** (Hydrogen fluoride).\n    *   This means gas **B** must be a compound containing chlorine (and likely fluorine). A common gaseous interhalogen compound is **ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride), a powerful fluorinating agent.\n    *   The reaction `HF + ClF₃` is known to form adducts (e.g., H[ClF₄]) that can function as specialized non-aqueous solvents, which fits the description of **H**.\n    *   So, we identify **B = ClF₃** and **D = HF**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: Identifying the Core Solid**\n    *   `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    *   Substituting B, the reaction is `A(s) + 8ClF₃(g) -> C(bright red)`.\n    *   From Clue 3, we know that A is regenerated upon hydrolysis. This means A is a very stable core. The use of ClF₃, an extremely potent fluorinating agent often employed in nuclear fuel processing, combined with the \"bright red\" color, strongly suggests an actinide compound. The most common stable solid oxide of uranium is **Uranium dioxide (UO₂) **.\n    *   So, we identify **A = UO₂**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: Identifying the Hazardous Product**\n    *   `C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n    *   Substituting our identified species: `(UO₂-ClF₃ complex) + 2HF(g) -> E`.\n    *   Reacting the complex C with excess HF will drive the reaction to form the simplest, most stable uranium oxyfluoride, which is **Uranyl fluoride (UO₂F₂) **.\n    *   Uranyl fluoride is a soluble uranium compound, making it both highly toxic and radioactive. This fits the description \"extremely hazardous\" perfectly.\n    *   We can now confidently identify **E = UO₂F₂**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (UO₂F₂)**\n    *   The final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of UO₂F₂.\n    *   Gas-phase experimental data shows that the UO₂F₂ molecule is not planar. It has a central uranium atom. The O=U=O group is bent, and the F-U-F group is also bent, with the two fluorine atoms in a *cis* position relative to each other.\n    *   The symmetry elements of this structure are:\n        *   One **C₂** rotational axis that passes through the uranium atom and bisects both the O-U-O and F-U-F angles.\n        *   Two perpendicular **σᵥ** (vertical) mirror planes that both contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the UO₂ atoms, and the other contains the UF₂ atoms.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>"
