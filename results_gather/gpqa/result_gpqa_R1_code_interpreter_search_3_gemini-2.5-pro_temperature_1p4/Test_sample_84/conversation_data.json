    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its albedo. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both equations and cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`). This allows for further simplification:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ((2 * a_2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n5.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by the formula: Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength. The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    K = (Δλ_max / λ₀) * c\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is directly proportional to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (Δλ₁ / λ₀) * c / (Δλ₂ / λ₀) * c = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)` is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    So, K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)\n\n7.  **Use the Transit Information:** The problem states the planets were detected by *both* the transit and RV methods. A transit can only be observed if the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees (i.e., the system is viewed edge-on). For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the equation for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)\n\n8.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to find `a` to get the ratio `a₂/a₁`. Let's rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\n9.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁):** Now we can compute the ratio using the formula for `a`. Note that `G` and `M_star` are constants for both planets and will cancel out.\n    a₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p2² / (M_star * K₂²)] / [G * M_p1² / (M_star * K₁²)]\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n10. **Substitute and Calculate:** We have all the pieces to find the final temperature ratio.\n    *   Ratio of planet masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n    *   Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n    First, calculate a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n\n    Now, substitute this into the temperature ratio formula from step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (5/7)² * (3/4)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Final Numerical Calculation:** Perform the final division. This can be done with a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# Masses of the planets in Earth masses\nm_p1 = 7.0\nm_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the planet masses (M_p2/M_p1)\nM_ratio_2_over_1 = m_p2 / m_p1\n\n# From the derivation, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\n# and a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2/M_p1) * (K1/K2)\ntemperature_ratio = M_ratio_2_over_1 * K_ratio_1_over_2\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357.

Our next task is to find `a₂ / a₁`.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Parameters to Radial Velocity (RV):** The problem provides information from the radial velocity method (Doppler shifts). The RV semi-amplitude (K), which is the maximum speed of the star's wobble, can be related to the planet's properties. For a planet in a circular orbit where the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the formula is:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)` is the planet's orbital velocity and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    Substituting `v_p`, we get:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)\n\n6.  **Use the Transit Information:** The problem states that the planets were also detected via the transit method. This is a key piece of information because transits are only observable when the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` is very close to 90°. For `i` ≈ 90°, `sin(i)` ≈ 1.\n    This simplifies the RV formula to:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):** Now we can find the ratio using the formula for `a`.\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n    *   The gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both systems and cancel out.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n9.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light. The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)`\n    The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n10. **Combine the Ratios:** Substitute the expression for `K₁/K₂` back into the equation for `a₂/a₁`:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n    Now, substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio from Step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15 / 28\n\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value of 15/28.\n\n```python\n# M_p2 / M_p1\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Delta_lambda_1 / Delta_lambda_2\nshift_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The final temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is the product of these two ratios.\ntemperature_ratio = mass_ratio_2_over_1 * shift_ratio_1_over_2\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)`\n    The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n10. **Combine the Ratios:** Substitute the expression for `K₁/K₂` back into the equation for `a₂/a₁`:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n    Now, substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio from Step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15 / 28\n\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value of 15/28.\n\n```python\n# M_p2 / M_p1\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Delta_lambda_1 / Delta_lambda_2\nshift_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The final temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is the product of these two ratios.\ntemperature_ratio = mass_ratio_2_over_1 * shift_ratio_1_over_2\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbit. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the planet's semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem provides several conditions that allow for simplification:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   Both planets are stated to have the same albedo, so `A₁ = A₂`, and the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term cancels out.\n    *   The constant `2` also cancels from the square root.\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Connect Observations to Physical Properties:** The problem provides Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) and planet masses (`M_p`). We need to relate these to the semi-major axis (`a`). The Doppler shift is caused by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`), which is induced by the orbiting planet. The maximum radial velocity is the semi-amplitude, K.\n    The formula relating `K` to the planet's properties, for a circular orbit and a planet much less massive than the star, is:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n6.  **Incorporate Transit Information:** The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods. A transit is only seen if the system is edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` ≈ 90°. For this inclination, `sin(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the equation to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K₁²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n9.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler formula states `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`. The maximum shift `Δλ_max` corresponds to `K`.\n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n10. **Combine Ratios:** Substitute the result from step 9 into the equation from step 8:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n    Now substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio from step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    Taking the square root gives the final, simple relationship:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n11. **Final Calculation:** Plug the given values into this final formula.\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n```python\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5.0 / 7.0\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\nshift_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios.\nequilibrium_temp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(equilibrium_temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given choices, it is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
