    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The problem describes radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a process governed by exponential decay statistics. The most crucial property of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom doesn't \"get old\" or \"wear out\". So, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay is irrelevant for predicting its future behavior.\n\n2.  **Define the Goal:** I need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has survived for the first 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating the probability that a brand-new atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   The probability `P(t)` of an atom decaying within a time `t` is given by the formula: `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom *surviving* for a time `t` is `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   So, `P_decay(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Using the formula: `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`.\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   I don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself. I can use this survival probability `P_survive(100) = 0.68` as a basis for my next calculation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   I need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. As established, this is `P_decay(150)`.\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   Now, I need to relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to the value I already know, `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   I can use the rules of exponents: `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the known value: `P_survive(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The final step is to compute `1 - (0.68)^1.5`. This is a calculator task. I will use a Python script to get a precise value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nprob_survive_100 = 0.68\n\n# The probability of survival for 150 minutes can be calculated from this.\n# P_survive(t) = exp(-lambda*t)\n# P_survive(150) = exp(-lambda*150) = exp(-lambda*100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda*100))^1.5\n# P_survive(150) = (P_survive(100))^1.5\nprob_survive_150 = prob_survive_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - P_survive(150)\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survive_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 44.18%, which corresponds to the answer choice 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random process governed by exponential decay statistics. A key property of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom does not \"age\" or get \"weaker.\" Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed is irrelevant to the calculation of its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula: `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant specific to this type of atom.\n    *   The probability that an atom decays within a time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    *   Using the formula: `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n        `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the known survival probability. We don't need to calculate `λ` explicitly; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is the same as finding the probability that a brand new atom of this type would decay in a 150-minute interval. So, we need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the rules of exponents and our known value from step 3:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now substitute the value we found:\n        `P_survive(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n        `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    The final step is to calculate the value of `1 - (0.68)^1.5`. We can use a short Python script for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32\nprob_survive_100 = 1 - 0.32\n\n# The probability of survival for 150 minutes is P_survive(100) raised to the power of 1.5\nprob_survive_150 = prob_survive_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survive_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}\")\n```",

    "The problem has been solved correctly. Here is a summary of the logic:\n\n1.  **Memoryless Property:** Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. The fact that the atom survived for the first 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in the future. We can treat the problem as if we are starting from time t=0.\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Rate:** The probability of decay `P(t)` in a time `t` is `1 - e^(-λt)`. We are given `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the New Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` as `(e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the value from step 2: `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Nature of Radioactive Decay:** A fundamental principle of radioactive decay is that it is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability that an atomic nucleus will decay in a given time interval is constant and does not depend on how long the nucleus has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. We are simply asked to find the probability of this type of atom decaying within a 150-minute period.\n\n2.  **Using the Provided Data to Characterize the Atom:** The probability of decay, `P(t)`, within a time `t` follows the exponential decay law:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find a value related to `λ`:\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Desired Probability:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`:\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can use a mathematical trick to relate this to the value we found in the previous step. Using the rules of exponents:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\n    Now, we can substitute the value we calculated:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%. The closest answer choice is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
