    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The integration values for the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n    Total protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n    Let's check the molecular formulas of the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C5H8O2. It contains 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (e.g., CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. It contains 3+1+1+2+3 = 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n    *   Based on the proton count, the compound must be propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the individual signals and their splitting patterns.**\n    We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d).\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet for 3 protons in this chemical shift region is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-CO-CH3). This corresponds to the protons labeled (d). They are a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group next to a single proton (-CH-CH3). This corresponds to the allylic methyl group (a), which is split by the adjacent vinylic proton (b).\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets for 1 proton means this proton is coupled to one other single proton and a group of three protons. This corresponds to the vinylic proton (b). It is split into a quartet by the adjacent methyl group (a) and into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (c).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet for 1 proton means it is coupled to one other proton. This corresponds to the vinylic proton (c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton (b). Its chemical shift is the highest (most downfield) because it is on a carbon atom directly attached to the electronegative oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\n    The stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   The J-coupling for trans-vinylic protons is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   The J-coupling for cis-vinylic protons is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    The problem states that the doublet at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz. This large value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The molecule is propenyl acetate with a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The problem provides the integration values for each signal: 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n    Summing these gives the total number of protons in the molecule: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula from the options.**\n    *   Propenyl acetate (both cis and trans): The structure is CH3–CH=CH–O–CO–CH3. The molecular formula is C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the NMR data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (both cis and trans): A common structure would be CH3–CH=CH–CH2–O–CO–CH3. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   Based on the total proton count, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and C). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Assign the NMR signals to the structure of propenyl acetate (CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d)).**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) representing 3 protons around 2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetate group). This is the CH3(d) group. It's a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon or oxygen.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) representing 3 protons is a methyl group split by a single adjacent proton. This corresponds to the allylic methyl group, CH3(a), which is adjacent to and split by the vinylic proton H(b).\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets (dq) for 1 proton indicates it is coupled to two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This matches the vinylic proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton H(c) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(a).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet (d) for 1 proton at a high chemical shift (downfield) is characteristic of a vinylic proton on a carbon attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (C=CH–O). This corresponds to H(c). It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent vinylic proton H(b).\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\n    The stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   The typical range for a **trans** coupling constant is J = 12–18 Hz.\n    *   The typical range for a **cis** coupling constant is J = 6–12 Hz.\n    The data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** for the signal at 7.0 ppm. This large value is characteristic of a **trans** arrangement of the vinylic protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is propenyl acetate, and the double bond has a trans configuration. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>",

These are the protons labeled (d). They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a singlet.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) for 3 protons indicates a methyl group next to a single proton (a –CH–CH₃ group). This corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, CH₃(a). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets (dq) for 1 proton indicates it is coupled to a single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This signal corresponds to the vinyl proton H(b), which is split by H(c) into a doublet and by the methyl group CH₃(a) into a quartet.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet (d) for 1 proton at a high chemical shift (downfield) is the other vinyl proton, H(c). It is shifted downfield because it is on a carbon directly attached to the electronegative oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by the adjacent proton H(b).\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):** The geometry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant (*J*) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n    *   For **trans** protons on a double bond, the coupling constant (*J*<sub>trans</sub>) is typically large, in the range of **12–18 Hz**.\n    *   For **cis** protons on a double bond, the coupling constant (*J*<sub>cis</sub>) is smaller, in the range of **6–12 Hz**.\n\n    The data provides a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe NMR data corresponds to a propenyl acetate molecule with a trans double bond.

This signal perfectly describes the vinylic proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by H(c) and into a quartet by the three protons of CH₃(a).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet (d) for a single proton at a downfield chemical shift corresponds to the other vinylic proton, H(c).
