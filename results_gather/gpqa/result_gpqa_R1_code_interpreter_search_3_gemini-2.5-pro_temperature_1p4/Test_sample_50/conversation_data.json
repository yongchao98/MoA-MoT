    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Method**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0). This problem is best solved using the **method of images**.\n\nThe core idea is to replace the complex system of the point charge and the induced charges on the sphere with a simpler equivalent system consisting of the original charge `q` and one or more \"image charges\". These image charges are placed inside the region formerly occupied by the conductor (the sphere) in such a way that the potential on the boundary surface (at r=R) is correctly reproduced (in this case, V=0).\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field outside the sphere is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and a single image charge `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe standard results for the image charge and its position are:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThese values are chosen precisely so that the potential at any point on the surface of the sphere (r=R) due to both `q` and `q'` sums to zero, satisfying the grounded condition.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where potential energy is zero) to its final position `d`.\n\nA general formula for the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i) + (1/2) * ∫(σ * V dS)`\n\nWhere `q_i` are point charges, `V_i` is the potential at their location due to all other charges, `σ` is the surface charge density on conductors, and `V` is the potential on the conductor surfaces.\n\nIn our case:\n*   We have one point charge, `q`.\n*   We have one conductor, the sphere. Since it's grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0.\n\nSo the formula simplifies significantly:\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_other(at q) + ∫(σ * V_sphere dS)]`\nSince `V_sphere = 0`, the integral term vanishes.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_other(at q)`\n\nHere, `V_other(at q)` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. The only other charges are the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\n**4. Using the Image Charge to Find the Potential**\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is exactly equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate this potential:\n*   The potential is created by the image charge `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n*   The location of `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   The location of `q` is at `d`.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential `V_other` at the location of `q` is:\n`V_other(at q) = k * q' / Δx`\n`V_other(at q) = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_other(at q) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Final Calculation of Potential Energy**\n\nNow we substitute this potential back into our energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_other(at q)`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are equivalent to the field and potential created by the original point charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`. The image charge is placed at a specific location inside the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` from the center are given by:\n\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position `d`. A common way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_other`\n\nwhere `V_other` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, the \"other charges\" are the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe method of images provides a crucial shortcut: the potential created by the induced surface charges outside the sphere is exactly equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) that is produced by the image charge `q'` (at a distance `b` from the center).\n\n**3. Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.**\n    The distance is `Δx = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n*   **Calculate the potential at the location of `q` due to `q'`.**\n    This potential is `V_image = k * q' / Δx`, where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n    Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `Δx`:\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Calculate the total potential energy `U` of the system.**\n    Now, we plug this potential into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\nA) `U = -k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula matches option B.

    "This problem is a classic application of the **method of images** in electrostatics. Here is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. The Setup and the Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (V = 0).\n\nThe complex electric field created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface can be simplified.

    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is best solved using the **method of images**.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` located a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V = 0`). The charge `q` will induce a distribution of charge on the surface of the sphere. The potential energy of the system arises from the interaction between the charge `q` and these induced charges.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The method of images allows us to replace the complex system of the point charge and the induced surface charge with a simpler, equivalent system. For the region outside the sphere (`r ≥ R`), the electric potential is identical to the potential created by the original charge `q` and a single \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge is placed *inside* the sphere at a specific location `b` from the center.\n\n    The values for the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the sphere's surface (`V(r=R) = 0`). The standard results are:\n    *   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where energy is zero) to its final position at `d`. A very useful formula for the potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges is:\n\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`\n\n    Where `V_other` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, the \"other charges\" are the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\n4.  **Use the Image Charge to Find `V_other`:** The key insight from the method of images is that the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface is exactly equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    So, we need to calculate the potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) that is produced by the image charge `q'` (at a distance `b` from the center).\n\n    *   First, find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. Since they are on the same line from the center, the distance is `Δx = d - b`.\n        `Δx = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    *   Next, calculate the potential at the location of `q` due to `q'`.
