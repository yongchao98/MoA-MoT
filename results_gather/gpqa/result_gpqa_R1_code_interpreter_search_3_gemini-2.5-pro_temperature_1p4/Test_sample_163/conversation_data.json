The relationship between the total mass (M), the orbital period (P), and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1, K2) is derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**1.

This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. We will make this standard assumption.\nTherefore, v₁ ≈ K₁ and v₂ ≈ K₂.\n\nNow, we can express the semi-major axes in terms of the observed quantities:\na₁ ≈ (P * K₁) / (2π)\na₂ ≈ (P * K₂) / (2π)\na = a₁ + a₂ ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂)) / (2π)\n\nSubstitute this expression for 'a' back into the equation for the total mass:\nM_total ≈ (4π² / (G * P²)) * [(P * (K₁ + K₂)) / (2π)]³\nM_total ≈ (4π² / (G * P²)) * [P³ * (K₁ + K₂)³ / (8π³)]\nM_total ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2πG)\n\nThis final expression shows that the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\nM_total ∝ P * (K_total)³, where K_total = K₁ + K₂.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Mass Ratio:**\n\nWe can now use this proportionality to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂):\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total_1)³] / [P₂ * (K_total_2)³]\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   K₁ₐ = 10 km/s, K₁ᵦ = 5 km/s\n    *   Total K for system 1 (K_total_1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   K₂ₐ = 15 km/s, K₂ᵦ = 10 km/s\n    *   Total K for system 2 (K_total_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, compute the ratio:\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432.

    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to find the ratio of their total masses (M₁ / M₂). The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\n**1. Underlying Physics**\n\nThe relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\nM₁ + M₂ = (4π²a³) / (GP²)\nwhere M₁ + M₂ is the total mass, a is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (a = a₁ + a₂), G is the gravitational constant, and P is the orbital period.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the orbital velocities (v) are related to the orbital radii (a) by v = 2πa / P.\nThe observed quantities are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity, K, which are related to the true orbital velocities by K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the inclination of the orbit.\nSince the systems are eclipsing, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, we can approximate the orbital velocities as v ≈ K.\n\nFrom v ≈ K = 2πa / P, we can write the semi-major axes as:\na₁ ≈ (P * K₁) / (2π)\na₂ ≈ (P * K₂) / (2π)\n\nThe total semi-major axis is a = a₁ + a₂ ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂)) / (2π).\n\nSubstituting this expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Law, we get:\nM_total = M₁ + M₂ ≈ (1 / (2πG)) * P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nThis shows that the total mass of the system is proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n**2. Calculating the Mass Ratio**\n\nWe can use this proportionality to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2):\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_1a + K_1b)³] / [P₂ * (K_2a + K_2b)³]\n\n**3. Plugging in the Values**\n\n*   **For system_1:**\n    *   P₁ = 2 years\n    *   K_1a + K_1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For system_2:**\n    *   P₂ = 1 year\n    *   K_2a + K_2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**4. Computation**\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the mass of system_2.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Law:** The total mass of a binary star system is related to its orbital properties. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) can be determined using a form of Kepler's Third Law that incorporates spectroscopic data. The formula is:\n    M_total = (P / (2πG * sin³(i))) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n    where:\n    *   M_total is the total mass of the two stars.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K₁ and K₂ are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n2.  **Use Key Information from the Problem:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For an eclipse to be observed, the orbital inclination `i` must be very close to 90°. If `i` ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This significantly simplifies the mass equation.\n\n3.  **Establish Proportionality:** With sin³(i) ≈ 1, and recognizing that (2πG) is a constant, the relationship for the total mass simplifies to a proportionality:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n    This means the total mass is directly proportional to the orbital period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Ratio:** To find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their masses, M₁ / M₂. Using the proportionality from the previous step, the constant terms cancel out:\n    M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ᵦ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ᵦ)³]\n\n5.  **Gather the Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n        *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n        *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now, substitute the values into the equation. A python script can perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The ratio of the total masses M1/M2 is proportional to (P * K_total^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total**3)) / (P2 * (K2_total**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value 0.432 is closest to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
