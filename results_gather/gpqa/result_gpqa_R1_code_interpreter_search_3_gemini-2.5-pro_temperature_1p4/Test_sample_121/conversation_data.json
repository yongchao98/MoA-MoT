    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Although the conditions are not the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction (which uses PBr3), the combination of bromine and a base (pyridine) points towards the formation of bromoacetic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process in one pot.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon alpha to both the cyano and ester groups (the most acidic position). The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    2.  **Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining alpha-proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion. This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. The chain consists of the alpha-carbon plus the 5 carbons of the pentane chain, leading to the formation of a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    ```\n          EtOOC  CN\n               \\ /\n                C1\n              /   \\\n         H2C(2)---CH2(6)\n        /           \\\n     H2C(3)         CH2(5)\n        \\           /\n         --CH2(4)--\n    ```\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of signals, we must identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The C1 carbon is attached to four groups: -CN, -COOEt, and the cyclohexane ring via C2 and C6. Because the path around the ring from C1 via C2 is identical to the path via C6 (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-), C1 is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester's C-CO-O fragment (assuming time-averaging due to free rotation).\n\n2.  **Signal Counting:**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 lie on the symmetry plane and are mirror images of each other. They are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The C2 and C6 positions are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic because of their fixed spatial relationship to the different substituents on the prochiral C1 center. Therefore, they are not chemically equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals from this group of four protons. **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the protons on the equivalent C3 and C5 positions are also diastereotopic. This gives another two signals. **2 signals**.\n        *   *Total signals from the ring = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 signals.*\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3) Protons:**\n        *   **-CH3 Protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-O-CH2- Protons:** These two methylene protons are adjacent to an oxygen connected to a prochiral center (C1). While in simpler achiral molecules such protons would be enantiotopic (and give 1 signal), the sterically bulky and complex achiral environment of the substituted cyclohexane ring can restrict rotation and create different time-averaged environments for the two protons. This makes them diastereotopic. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will produce two different signals (which might appear as a complex multiplet). **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Final Tally:**\n    *   Ring signals: 5\n    *   Ethyl group signals: 1 (from -CH3) + 2 (from -O-CH2-) = 3\n    *   Total distinct hydrogen signals = 5 + 3 = **8**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis and the analysis of the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Product 1: Acetic acid to Bromoacetic acid**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. While not the standard Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, the reagents achieve the same outcome. The alpha-protons of acetic acid are made acidic and can be substituted by bromine.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 2: Bromoacetic acid to Ethyl bromoacetate**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH₂-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 3: Ethyl bromoacetate to Ethyl cyanoacetate**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Sₙ2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).** The hydrogens on the central CH₂ group are now significantly acidic because they are alpha to two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group).\n\n4.  **Product 4: Ethyl cyanoacetate to Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a two-step sequence happening in one pot.\n        1.  **First Alkylation:** NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion. This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane chain and displacing one bromine atom.\n            `NC-CH(COOEt)⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br`\n        2.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** Since *excess* NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion. This carbanion then attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, which has a bromine atom, in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. This closes a ring. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\n\n```\n      EtOOC  CN\n           \\ /\n            C(1)\n          /   \\\n     H₂C(2)---CH₂(6)\n    /           \\\n H₂C(3)         CH₂(5)\n    \\           /\n     --CH₂(4)--\n```\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the cyano group (CN), the C1 carbon, the ester group (COOEt), and the C4 carbon of the ring. This symmetry plane dictates which protons are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. They are enantiotopic and therefore chemically equivalent (in a standard achiral NMR solvent). This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **C2/C6 Protons:** Due to the symmetry plane, the set of protons on C2 is equivalent to the set on C6. However, on any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons are not equivalent to each other. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1, making them diastereotopic. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the C3 and C5 positions are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Therefore, these four protons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total signals from the ring = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 signals.*\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid free rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** The two protons of the methylene group are attached to an oxygen, which is connected to the C1 carbon of the ring. C1 is a prochiral center, and its asymmetric environment makes the two methylene protons diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two different signals. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Final Tally:**\n*   Signals from the cyclohexane ring: 5\n*   Signals from the ethyl group: 1 (from -CH₃) + 2 (from -OCH₂) = 3\n*   **Total number of distinct hydrogen signals = 5 + 3 = 8**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the detailed reasoning process to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is the starting material. The reagents are for α-bromination. While the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr₃, this combination achieves the same result: bromination at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Ethanol, H₂SO₄, heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) reacts with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification.

The two protons on the central carbon (α-carbon) are now quite acidic, being positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester carbonyl group).\n\n4.  **Reaction 4: Product 3 + excess NaH, then 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate), a strong base (NaH), and a dihaloalkane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a two-step process in one pot.\n        1.  **Deprotonation and Alkylation:** The strong base, NaH, removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion. This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom via an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        2.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** Because *excess* NaH is used, the second acidic α-proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion. This carbanion then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the newly attached chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.

This symmetry makes certain positions equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton signals:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n    *   **Methyl protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-O-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the prochiral C₁ center of the ring.

This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **C₂ and C₆ protons:** The C₂ and C₆ positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C₂ (and C₆) are diastereotopic because of their different spatial relationships (one \"axial,\" one \"equatorial\") to the substituents on C₁.

They are adjacent to the prochiral C₁ center, making them diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C₄ protons:** The two protons on the C₄ carbon are equivalent as they are interchangeable through the plane of symmetry (enantiotopic). **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C₂ and C₆ protons:** The positions are equivalent by symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are non-equivalent to each other (diastereotopic). Therefore, the four protons at these positions give rise to **(2 signals)**.\n    *   **C₃ and C₅ protons:** Similarly, the positions are equivalent by symmetry, but the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. The four protons at these positions give rise to **(2 signals)**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 + 2 = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 distinct signals.**\n\n<<<C>>>"
