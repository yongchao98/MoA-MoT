    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in this model are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_v + E_J = ħω(v + 1/2) + B J(J + 1)\n    where:\n    *   v is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   J is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n    *   ω is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   B is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: v = 0 and J = 0.\n    Initial state: (v=0, J=0).\n\n3.  **Determine the Final State and Transition Energy:**\n    The problem asks for the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This can be interpreted in two ways:\n    a) The absolute lowest energy jump from the ground state.\n    b) The lowest energy jump involving a change in the vibrational state (a rovibrational transition).\n\n    Let's analyze both possibilities based on the selection rules for photon absorption from the J=0 state:\n    *   **Pure Rotational Transition:** Δv = 0, ΔJ = +1. The final state is (v=0, J=1).\n        ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = [ħω(1/2) + B(1)(2)] - [ħω(1/2) + B(0)(1)] = 2B.\n    *   **Rovibrational Transition:** Δv = +1, ΔJ = ±1. Since J starts at 0, only ΔJ = +1 is possible. The final state is (v=1, J=1).\n        ΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = [ħω(1 + 1/2) + B(1)(2)] - [ħω(1/2) + B(0)(1)] = ħω + 2B.\n\n    Typically, vibrational energy level spacing (ħω) is much larger than rotational energy spacing (2B). Therefore, the rovibrational transition (ħω + 2B) corresponds to a significantly higher energy than the pure rotational transition (2B). Looking at the options provided, they correspond to a higher energy transition. This suggests the question is referring to the fundamental rovibrational transition (v=0 → v=1), which is a common topic in infrared spectroscopy. Thus, the energy of the absorbed photon is ΔE = ħω + 2B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.\n        Convert to kg: μ = 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μR² = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        B = ħ² / (2I) = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.605 × 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   **Vibrational Energy Change (ħω):**\n        ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B = (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.605 × 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE = 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.000921 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is negligible compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light.\n    p = ΔE / c = (4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.407 × 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s).\n\nThis value is very close to option C.

For a rovibrational transition (where both v and J change), the selection rules for photon absorption are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from `J = 0`, only a positive change is possible (ΔJ = +1).\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (`v=0, J=0`) to the final state (`v=1, J=1`).\n\n**2. Photon Energy Calculation**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states:\n\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nTo find ΔE, we must first calculate the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia `I` and reduced mass `μ`.\n\n**3. Calculation of Molecular Properties**\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n\n**4. Photon Momentum**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) by the equation E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the momentum is:\np = ΔE / c = (ħω + 2B) / c\n\nNow, we will use a Python script to perform the numerical calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Constants ---\nh_bar = const.hbar      # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = const.c             # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = const.physical_constants['atomic mass constant'][0]\n\n# --- Given Values ---\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_meters = 2.0e-10  # Bond length in meters\nomega_rad_s = 4.0e14 # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (mu) in kg\nmu_kg = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu) * amu_to_kg\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu_kg * R_meters**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B)\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total transition energy (Delta_E = h_bar*omega + 2*B)\ndelta_E = (h_bar * omega_rad_s) + (2 * B)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the photon's momentum (p = E/c)\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The calculated momentum of the photon is {p:.2e} N*s\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated momentum of the photon is 1.41e-28 N*s\n\nThe calculated momentum is approximately 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s.
