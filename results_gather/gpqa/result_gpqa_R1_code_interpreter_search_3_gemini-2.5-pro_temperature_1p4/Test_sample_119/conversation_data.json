    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `d = 1/plx`. For simplicity, we can ignore the specific units (like parsecs and arcseconds) as we are only interested in the proportionality.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth). Let the shell have a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is `dN = ρ * dV`.\n    *   Substituting the expression for `dV`, we get: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`). To do this, we need to replace the distance variables (`d` and `dd`) with parallax variables (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   We use the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the differential `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. We differentiate the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases, distance decreases. When considering the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `|dd|` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * |dd|`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴)`\n    *   Since `ρ` (star density) and `4π` are constants, we can express this as a proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on the parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **State the Core Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n3.  **Consider Stars in a Distance Shell:** Imagine a thin, spherical shell of space centered on Earth. The shell has an inner radius `d` and an outer radius `d + dd`, where `dd` is a very small thickness.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV ≈ A * dd = 4πd² dd`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this small volume `dV` is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² dd)`\n\n5.  **Change Variables from Distance (`d`) to Parallax (`plx`):** The relationship between the distance to a star and its parallax is inversely proportional:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n6.  **Relate the Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to express the thickness of the shell `dd` in terms of a small change in parallax `d(plx)`. We do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1)`), where `n = -1`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1 / plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = (-1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    When we consider the number of stars in a parallax \"bin\" of width `d(plx)`, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign. The negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases.\n    `dd ≈ (1 / plx²) * d(plx)` for a small positive interval `d(plx)`.\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Equation for `dN`:** Now, we replace `d` and `dd` in our equation `dN = 4πρd² dd` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`: `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`\n    *   Replace `dd` with `(1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    This gives:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`.\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n10. **Determine the Proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for this problem involves combining the concept of uniform spatial distribution with the definition of parallax.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. The shell is at a distance `d` and has a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The exact relationship is `d = 1/plx` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). We will use this relationship to switch our variables from distance to parallax.\n\n4.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we must rewrite the equation for `dN` entirely in terms of `plx`.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`\n    *   Next, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (plx⁻¹) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we count stars in a bin of a certain width, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute these parallax-based expressions back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * |dd|`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n\n    Combining the terms, we get:\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse of parallax to the fourth power.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine how the number of stars per unit parallax changes.\n\n1.  **Core Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars by Distance:** Let's consider a thin, spherical shell of space centered on Earth. The shell has a radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the density of stars (`ρ`) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is simply the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n    This equation gives us the number of stars located at a distance between `d` and `d + dd`.\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** The goal is to express the number of stars in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance. The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    (Where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Changing Variables from Distance to Parallax:** We need to replace both `d` and `dd` in our equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx`. This means `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   Second, we need to find how the shell thickness `dd` relates to a small interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (plx⁻¹) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign just shows that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are counting stars in a parallax \"bin\" of a certain width, we care about the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute these new expressions for `d²` and `dd` back into our equation for the number of stars, `dN`.\n    `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * (dd)`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n\n    Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the term `dN/d(plx)`. To find this, we simply divide both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means that as you look at stars with smaller and smaller parallax (which are farther and farther away), the number of stars you find within a fixed parallax interval (e.g., between 0.01\" and 0.02\") grows very rapidly.\n\n<<<C>>>",
