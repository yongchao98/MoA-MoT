    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nA compound shows optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some allenes and biphenyls). A molecule is achiral (not chiral) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a derivative of biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** It has large, bulky substituents (nitro groups -NO₂ and ester groups -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing the two phenyl rings from rotating freely about the central single bond. This forces the rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other).\n    *   **Chirality:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since all four groups attached to this carbon atom are different, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and therefore exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule's structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* position relative to the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the double-bonded carbons. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). This molecule also possesses a center of inversion, located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism, its diastereomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (plane of symmetry and center of inversion) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Let's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule has bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO₂, and dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups prevent the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond due to steric hindrance.\n    *   **Chirality**: This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. In this twisted state, the molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the molecule is chiral, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis**: We look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. Furthermore, a plane of symmetry bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. This molecule also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality**: The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.

    "A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.
