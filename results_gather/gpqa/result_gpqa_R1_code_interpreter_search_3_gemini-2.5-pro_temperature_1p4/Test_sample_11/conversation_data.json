    "This is a classic two-body decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) is at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ) are created and move apart.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.

    "This problem can be solved using the laws of conservation of energy and momentum for relativistic particles.\n\n### **1. Principles**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, so the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the decay products—the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν)—must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion (`m_πc²`). This must be equal to the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_μ`) and the neutrino (`E_ν`) after the decay.\n\n### **2. Equations**\n\nThe conservation laws give us:\n1.  `p_μ = p_ν = p` (magnitudes of momentum)\n2.  `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n\n*   For the massive muon (μ⁺): `E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`\n*   For the neutrino (ν), we assume it is massless: `E_ν = pc`. The total energy of a massless particle is its kinetic energy, so `KE_ν = pc`.\n\n### **3. Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n`m_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc`\n\nTo solve for `pc` (the neutrino's kinetic energy), we rearrange the equation:\n`m_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`\n\nNow, square both sides:\n`(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n`(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n\nThe `(pc)²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `pc`:\n`pc = KE_ν = ( (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ) / ( 2 * m_πc² )`\n\nPlugging in the given values (`m_πc² = 139.6 MeV` and `m_μc² = 105.7 MeV`):\n`KE_ν = ( (139.6)² - (105.7)² ) / ( 2 * 139.6 )`\n`KE_ν = ( 19488.16 - 11172.49 ) / 279.2`\n`KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\nNow, we find the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_μ`). The total energy is conserved, so we can write:\n`Initial Energy = Final Energy`\n`m_πc² = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + KE_ν`\n`139.6 MeV = KE_μ + 105.7 MeV + 29.8 MeV`\n`KE_μ = 139.6 - 105.7 - 29.8`\n`KE_μ = 4.1 MeV`\n\nUsing the more precise value for `KE_ν`:\n`KE_μ = 139.6 - 105.7 - 29.78 = 4.12 MeV`.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.
