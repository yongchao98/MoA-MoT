    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This immediately suggests isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H) or ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This points to a highly reactive chemical pair.\n    *   **Clue 3: The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze possible simple gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Yes)\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes, but unlikely product from a violent chemical reaction).\n        *   A quick check of other common deuterated gases like CD₄ (10p, 10n), ND₃ (10p, 10n), and D₂O vapor (10p, 10n) also shows they fit this proton-neutron equality. However, D₂ is a very common product in reactions involving deuterides. Let's tentatively identify **W as D₂**.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   277 K is approximately 4°C.\n        *   The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K), which is very close to 277 K.\n        *   Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   If G releases D₂O upon heating, G is likely a deuterated hydroxide (e.g., Al(OD)₃) or a deuterated salt hydrate. For example, 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   From the clues, we have a reaction that produces D₂ gas and a compound that yields D₂O. A common reaction class for this is the reaction of a metal deuteride with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Reaction form: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W).\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A typical keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-R'-COOH. This molecule contains **three** oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group C=O, and two in the carboxylic acid group -COOH).\n        *   For the product to have only two oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (R-COOH → R-CH₂OH).\n        *   This type of reduction requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Clue 7: The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n        *   This strongly points to common, powerful reducing agents. The most famous one is Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH₄. Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄**. Other candidates like NaBD₄ (analog NaBH₄) are typically not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Reagents like CaD₂ (analog CaH₂) are not as common for this purpose.\n    *   Let's verify if **X = LiAlD₄** fits all clues.\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is extremely violent, which fits Clue 2.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits Clue 3.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OH)₃ is a well-known precipitate. Thus, its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate. This fits Clue 4.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ yields Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This fits Clue 4.\n        *   **Substance B:** The D₂O produced has a melting point of ~277 K. This fits Clue 5.\n        *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH, 3 oxygens) to a diol (R-CH(OD)-CD₂OD, 2 oxygens). This fits Clue 6.\n        *   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic chemistry. LiAlD₄ is its direct isotopic analog. This fits Clue 7.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Lightest element: **Hydrogen**. The isotope present is Deuterium (D, or ²H), which has an approximate atomic mass of 2 amu.\n    *   Heaviest element: **Aluminum** (Al). The isotope is ²⁷Al, which has an approximate atomic mass of 27 amu.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" directs us to account for all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula unit.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there is:\n        *   **1 atom** of the heaviest element (Al).\n        *   **4 atoms** of the lightest element (H, as D).\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Total mass of Aluminum atoms) + (Total mass of Hydrogen atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × Mass(Al)) + (4 × Mass(D))\n    *   Cumulative mass ≈ (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of regular water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**\n    *   Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4: \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"**\n    *   This indicates that G is a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. A common example is a metal hydroxide, which dehydrates to a metal oxide. Thus, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₙ. For instance, heating aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would yield aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O).\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 3: \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n    *   Let's check some simple deuterated gases:\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **CD₄ (Deuterated methane):** C (6p, 6n) + 4 * D (1p, 1n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **ND₃ (Deuterated ammonia):** N (7p, 7n) + 3 * D (1p, 1n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **D₂O (Heavy water vapor):** O (8p, 8n) + 2 * D (1p, 1n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. This fits.\n    *   However, the most straightforward interpretation of a substance reacting with water (or heavy water) to produce a gas is the production of hydrogen (or deuterium) gas.\n\n5.  **Synthesize Clues 2, 3, 4, 5: \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G...\"**\n    *   From our analysis, B is D₂O and W is likely D₂. The reaction produces a deuterated product (G) and deuterium gas. This strongly implies that the reactant liquid, Y, must be the source of the deuterium in the products. So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O (liquid Y) → D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₙ (precipitate G).\n    *   For this reaction to occur, substance X must be a very reactive deuteride, capable of reacting with D₂O to release D₂ gas. This is characteristic of reactive metal hydrides/deuterides.\n\n6.  **Analyze Clues 6 & 7: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n    *   A keto acid (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of **three** oxygen atoms.\n    *   The reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to **two**. This means the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. It reacts violently with water and can reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope (Deuterium) would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Analog:** LiAlH₄ is a staple reagent. Fits clue 7.\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This is a known, violent reaction.\n        *   **Products:** It produces D₂ gas (W) and Al(OD)₃ precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This fits all the reaction clues.\n        *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reagent to reduce a carboxylic acid, thus reducing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. This fits clue 6.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Li, Al, and H (as D).\n    *   Using approximate integer atomic masses: Li ≈ 7 amu, Al ≈ 27 amu, H ≈ 1 amu, D ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. There is **1 atom** of the heaviest element (Al) and **4 atoms** of the lightest element (as D).\n    *   The problem states to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nLet's confirm with a python script.\n```python\n# Define the atomic masses of the relevant elements and isotopes.\n# Using integer approximations is sufficient for this multiple-choice problem.\nmass_Al = 27  # Aluminum\nmass_D = 2   # Deuterium (the heavy isotope of the lightest element, Hydrogen)\n\n# The identified substance X is LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n\n# Count the number of atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\nnum_atoms_heaviest_element = 1  # There is one Al atom.\nnum_atoms_lightest_element = 4  # There are four D atoms.\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\n# Cumulative mass = (total mass of heaviest element's atoms) + (total mass of lightest element's atoms)\ncumulative_mass = (num_atoms_heaviest_element * mass_Al) + (num_atoms_lightest_element * mass_D)\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Initial Analysis of Clues:**\n\n1.  **Substance X and its isotope:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. This hints at isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, ¹⁸O, etc.\n2.  **Reaction products (B, G, W):**\n    *   **Substance B:** Its melting point is ~277 K. The melting point of regular water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**. This confirms the heavy isotope is Deuterium.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** G releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide (e.g., M(OD)ₙ) that dehydrates (or \"de-deuterates\") to a metal oxide upon heating.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential gases from the reaction:\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n3.  **The Reaction (X + Y -> W + G):**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a deuterated precipitate (G). Since the products contain Deuterium, the reactant Y is very likely the source, meaning **Y is D₂O** (liquid heavy water).\n    *   The reaction is therefore: X + D₂O → D₂ + Metal Deuteroxide(s). This is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride reacting with heavy water.\n4.  **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (general structure R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to an alcohol (-CH₂OH), a reaction that requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common, powerful reducing agent. The most well-known is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n\n**Identifying Substance X:**\n\n*   Based on the clues, the \"very close analog\" of LiAlH₄ containing the heavier isotope (Deuterium) is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   Let's verify if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n    *   **Reaction with D₂O:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is famously violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** It produces D₂ gas. Correct.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate. Correct.\n    *   **Substance B:** Heating Al(OD)₃ produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O. Correct.\n    *   **Organic Reaction:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing a carboxylic acid to an alcohol, thus reducing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. Correct.\n    *   **Analog:** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a staple in organic synthesis. Correct.\n\nAll clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in one formula unit.\n\n1.  **Identify elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Approximate atomic masses: Li ≈ 7, Al ≈ 27, H ≈ 1.\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n3.  **Sum the masses:**\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄, there is **one atom** of the heaviest element (Al) and **four atoms** of the lightest element's isotope (D).\n    *   The mass of one Aluminum (Al) atom is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   The mass of one Deuterium (D, or ²H) atom is approximately 2 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n```python\n# Atomic mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum, Al)\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Atomic mass of the relevant isotope of the lightest element (Deuterium, D)\nmass_D = 2\n\n# Number of atoms in the formula LiAlD4\nnum_Al = 1\nnum_D = 4\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = (num_Al * mass_Al) + (num_D * mass_D)\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1 & 5: Substance B's Melting Point:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is Deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C.\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n        *   This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first sentence is **Deuterium (D)**, the isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W's Composition:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   Let's check Deuterium gas (D₂), which would be a plausible product. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 4: The Reaction and Precipitate G:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing D₂ (W) and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (B).\n        *   Since the products (D₂ and D₂O) contain Deuterium, the reactant liquid Y must be the source of Deuterium. Therefore, **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n        *   G must be a deuterated compound that loses D₂O upon heating, which is typical for a metal deuteroxide decomposing into a metal oxide. For example: Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + D₂O. So, G is a metal deuteroxide.\n        *   The violent reaction of X with D₂O to produce D₂ gas is characteristic of a highly reactive metal deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 6 & 7: The Organic Chemistry Context:**\n        *   A \"keto acid\" (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) contains **3 oxygen atoms**. The reaction with X produces a product with only **2 oxygen atoms**. This requires the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n        *   The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n        *   The clue that \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points strongly to a common, potent reducing agent. The most famous is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n        *   Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavy isotope (Deuterium) would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of X and the Reaction:**\n\n    *   Let's assume **X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction with D₂O (Y) would be: **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   Heating Al(OD)₃ yields Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful enough reducing agent to perform the described transformation on a keto acid.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)\".\n    *   The elements are: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Using approximate integer atomic masses: Li ≈ 7; Al ≈ 27; H ≈ 1.\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. We have **1 atom of Aluminum** and **4 atoms of Deuterium**.\n    *   The mass of the isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has an approximate mass of 2 amu.\n    *   The mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   The problem asks to sum the masses of *all* instances of these lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Number of Al atoms × Mass of Al) + (Number of D atoms × Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe final calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The first crucial clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of ordinary water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is the deuterium isotope of hydrogen (²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also tells us that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's test Deuterium gas (D₂), which is a plausible product. A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y and Precipitate G:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ (W) and a precipitate G, which upon heating releases D₂O (B).\n    *   Since the reaction products (D₂ and D₂O) are deuterated, the reactant liquid Y must be the source of deuterium. This means **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: `X + D₂O → D₂ + G`.\n    *   The fact that G releases D₂O when heated suggests it's a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (general formula R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH). This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Clue: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly points to a common and powerful reagent. The most famous strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope (Deuterium) is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues. The reaction with heavy water (Y) would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   This reaction is notoriously violent. (✓)\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W).

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 31\nD) 35\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
