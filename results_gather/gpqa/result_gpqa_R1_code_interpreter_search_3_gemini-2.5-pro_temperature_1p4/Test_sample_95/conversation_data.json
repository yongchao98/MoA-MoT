    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main goal is to find the order of magnitude of the entropy (S) of a supermassive black hole.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Distance to the black hole, `d = 10^10` parsecs.\n    *   Angular size of the event horizon, `θ = 10^-17` degrees.\n\n3.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles and Formulas:**\n    *   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Formula:** The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The formula is:\n        `S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`\n        where:\n        *   `S` = Entropy\n        *   `k_B` = Boltzmann constant (~1.38 x 10^-23 J/K)\n        *   `c` = Speed of light (~3.00 x 10^8 m/s)\n        *   `A` = Area of the event horizon\n        *   `G` = Gravitational constant (~6.67 x 10^-11 N m²/kg²)\n        *   `ħ` = Reduced Planck constant (~1.05 x 10^-34 J s)\n\n    *   **Event Horizon Geometry:** For a simple, non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the event horizon is a sphere. Its area `A` is given by:\n        `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`\n        where `R_s` is the Schwarzschild radius.\n\n    *   **Angular Size to Physical Size Relation:** For a very small angle `θ`, the physical diameter `D` of an object at a distance `d` can be approximated by the small-angle formula:\n        `D ≈ d * θ`\n        **Important:** This formula requires the angle `θ` to be in radians. The diameter of the event horizon is `D = 2 * R_s`.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Step-by-Step Calculation Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Convert all given units to a consistent system (SI units).**\n        *   Convert the distance `d` from parsecs to meters.\n        *   Convert the angular size `θ` from degrees to radians.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the physical size (radius) of the event horizon.**\n        *   Use the small-angle formula `2 * R_s = d * θ` (with `d` in meters and `θ` in radians) to find the Schwarzschild radius `R_s`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the area of the event horizon.**\n        *   Use the formula `A = 4 * π * R_s^2` with the `R_s` value calculated in the previous step.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the entropy.**\n        *   Plug the calculated area `A` and the fundamental physical constants into the Bekenstein-Hawking formula `S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`.\n\n    *   **Step 5: Determine the Order of Magnitude.**\n        *   Examine the final result for `S` and identify its power of 10. Compare this with the given options.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan with a Computation Tool:** The calculation involves many constants with high/low powers of 10, making it prone to manual error. Using a Python script is ideal for accuracy and efficiency.\n\n    *   **Python Code Logic:**\n        1.  Import the `math` library for `pi`.\n        2.  Define all the constants (`k_B`, `c`, `G`, `ħ`) and the conversion factor for parsecs to meters.\n        3.  Define the input variables (`d_pc`, `theta_deg`).\n        4.  Perform the unit conversions: `d_m = d_pc * pc_to_m` and `theta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)`.\n        5.  Calculate the Schwarzschild radius: `Rs = (d_m * theta_rad) / 2`.\n        6.  Calculate the event horizon area: `A = 4 * math.pi * Rs**2`.\n        7.  Calculate the entropy: `S = (k_B * c**3 * A) / (4 * G * hbar)`.\n        8.
