    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The structure `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` is a norbornadiene derivative. Norbornadienes are excellent dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions due to their strained double bonds. It has two double bonds, so it can potentially react twice.\n    *   The reagent `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is an unusual name, and its reaction with NaI is not standard. However, a very common and similar reaction is the treatment of **o-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene** with NaI to generate **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene) in situ. This is a highly reactive diene, perfect for Diels-Alder reactions. Given the context (a good dienophile, 2 equivalents of the diene precursor), it is highly probable that the provided name is a typo or an obscure precursor for o-quinodimethane.\n    *   **Assumption:** We'll assume that `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` + NaI generates o-quinodimethane.\n    *   **Reaction:** A double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. The two molecules of o-quinodimethane add to the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n    *   **Product 1:** A large, symmetrical molecule is formed, with the central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core fused to two polycyclic systems derived from the o-quinodimethane. The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C7 atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acidic condition for the deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (`-O-tBu`) at the C7 position is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (`-OH`).\n*   **Product 2:** The same structure as Product 1, but with an -OH group at C7 instead of the -O-tBu group. The C2 symmetry is maintained. Product 2 is a secondary alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2.\n*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Analysis:** The Parikh-Doering reagent is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones. The hydroxyl group at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (`C=O`).\n*   **Product 3:** The same structure as Product 2, but the C7 alcohol is now a ketone. The molecule is a C7-ketone derivative of the double Diels-Alder adduct, and it still retains the C2 symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Condition:** Heated at 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions are often reversible at high temperatures. The reverse reaction is called a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. Product 3 is a double Diels-Alder adduct, and heating it is expected to cause a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This thermal decomposition will break Product 3 down into its constituent parts:\n        *   Two molecules of the diene: **o-quinodimethane**.\n        *   One molecule of the original dienophile skeleton, but with the final C7 functionality: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n    *   **Fate of the intermediates:**\n        *   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a retro-cheletropic reaction to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming **benzene**.\n        *   The two molecules of the reactive intermediate o-quinodimethane will react. The most common reaction for o-quinodimethane in the absence of other trapping agents is dimerization. The major thermal dimerization product is **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene**, formed via a formal [4+4] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The stable organic product remaining in the reaction vessel is the o-quinodimethane dimer, `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`. Benzene is also formed, and CO escapes as a gas. The question asks for \"final product 4,\" which implies a single, specific structure.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene` (C₁₆H₁₆). This molecule consists of two benzene rings linked by two ethylene (`-CH₂-CH₂-`) bridges, forming a central 8-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule is a chair-like structure which possesses a C2 axis of symmetry. This axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two benzene rings and the two ethylene bridges to each other.\n*   **Signal Counting:** Due to this symmetry, we only need to analyze one half of the molecule to count the unique proton environments.\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:**\n        *   The C2 axis makes the two benzene rings chemically equivalent.\n        *   We look at one benzene ring. It is ortho-disubstituted by the two CH₂ groups. There is no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation within this ring fragment itself. Therefore, the four protons on this benzene ring are all chemically distinct from one another.\n        *   This gives **4 unique aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:**\n        *   The C2 axis makes the two ethylene (`-CH₂-CH₂-`) bridges chemically equivalent.\n        *   We look at one bridge, which connects the two benzene rings. Let's label it Ar₁-CH₂(a)-CH₂(b)-Ar₂. The CH₂(a) group and the CH₂(b) group are not in equivalent environments.\n        *   The two protons on CH₂(a) are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center (the molecule as a whole is chiral or has chiral elements). Therefore, they are chemically distinct.\n        *   Similarly, the two protons on CH₂(b) are diastereotopic and chemically distinct from each other.\n        *   The protons on CH₂(a) are in a different environment from the protons on CH₂(b).\n        *   Therefore, all four protons within one half of the aliphatic structure (H₂C(a)-C(b)H₂) are chemically distinct.\n        *   This gives **4 unique aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the unique aromatic and aliphatic signals: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = 8.",
    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to determine the structure of the final product, **4**, and then count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (which corresponds to the number of signals in a proton NMR spectrum).\n\n**Step 1: Reaction 1 to form Product 1**\n*   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The first reactant, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is a norbornadiene derivative. Norbornadienes contain two double bonds and are excellent dienophiles for Diels-Alder reactions due to their ring strain.\n    *   The second reactant's name, `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`, is unconventional. A very common and related reaction involves the treatment of `1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene` with sodium iodide. This reaction generates `o-quinodimethane` (also known as o-xylylene), a highly reactive diene, in situ. Given the context (a good dienophile, 2 equivalents of a diene precursor), it is extremely likely that the provided name is a typo or an unusual isomer that ultimately forms `o-quinodimethane`. We will proceed with this standard assumption.\n    *   The reaction is a double Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The two double bonds of the norbornadiene each react with one molecule of the in-situ generated `o-quinodimethane`.\n*   **Product 1**: A large, symmetrical molecule is formed where the central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton is fused to two additional ring systems derived from the `o-quinodimethane`. The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C7 atom.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 2 to form Product 2**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 1.\n*   **Reagents**: Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Analysis**: These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the C7 position is removed, and a hydroxyl group (-OH) is formed.\n*   **Product 2**: The structure is the same as Product 1, but with an alcohol group at C7 instead of the tert-butoxy group. The molecule is a secondary alcohol and maintains the C2 symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 3 to form Product 3**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2.\n*   **Reagents**: SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Analysis**: The Parikh-Doering reagent is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other functional groups.\n*   **Product 3**: The C7 hydroxyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O). Product 3 is a ketone, and it still retains the C2 symmetry of the preceding structures.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 4 to form Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 3.\n*   **Condition**: Heated at 150 °C.\n*   **Analysis**: Diels-Alder reactions are typically reversible at high temperatures. The reverse reaction is called a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   Product 3, being a double Diels-Alder adduct, will undergo a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating.\n    *   This thermal decomposition breaks Product 3 into its original (or modified) components:\n        1.  Two molecules of the diene: `o-quinodimethane`.\n        2.  One molecule of the dienophile's skeleton: The original dienophile was a norbornadiene derivative. After the previous reaction steps, the C7 position is now a ketone. Therefore, the dienophile fragment released is `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n*   **Fate of the Intermediates**:\n    *   `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a retro-cheletropic reaction to extrude a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   The two molecules of the highly reactive `o-quinodimethane` cannot be isolated under these conditions and will react with each other. The major product from the thermal dimerization of `o-quinodimethane` is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n*   **Final Product 4**: The question asks for the structure of \"final product 4,\" which implies the stable, major organic product. This is the `o-quinodimethane` dimer.\n\n**Step 5: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n*   **Structure of Product 4**: `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`. This molecule consists of two benzene rings linked by two ethylene (`-CH₂-CH₂-`) bridges, forming a central 8-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry**: The most stable conformation of this molecule is a twist-boat form which has D₂ symmetry. This means it has three perpendicular C₂ axes of rotation. For our purpose, it's sufficient to recognize that there is at least one C₂ axis that makes the two halves of the molecule (one benzene ring and one ethylene bridge) chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the Signals**: We only need to analyze the protons in one half of the molecule.\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens**:\n        *   We consider one of the `o`-disubstituted benzene rings (a C₆H₄ group).\n        *   Because the overall molecule is three-dimensional and puckered, there is no plane of symmetry passing through this benzene ring.\n        *   Therefore, the four hydrogen atoms on this one ring are all in chemically different environments.\n        *   This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens**:\n        *   We consider one of the ethylene bridges (`-CH₂-CH₂-`).\n        *   The two CH₂ groups in the bridge are not equivalent. One is attached to one benzene ring, and the other is attached to the second benzene ring, and they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule.\n        *   Now consider one CH₂ group. The two protons on this carbon (geminal protons) are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a stereogenic center (the molecule as a whole is chiral). This means they are chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, all four hydrogen atoms on a single `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge are chemically distinct.\n        *   This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n*   **Total Count**: The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the unique aromatic and aliphatic signals: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product, **4**, and then determine its chemical symmetry to count the number of unique hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene + 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium Iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The first reactant, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is a norbornadiene derivative. Norbornadienes contain two strained double bonds, making them excellent dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   The second reactant, `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`, is an unusually named compound. However, the reaction of `1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene` with sodium iodide is a classic and very common laboratory method for generating `o-quinodimethane` (also known as o-xylylene) in situ. Given the context of a Diels-Alder reaction, it is highly probable that `o-quinodimethane` is the intended reactive intermediate.\n    *   The reaction is therefore a double Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Two molecules of `o-quinodimethane` (generated in situ) add across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n*   **Product 1**: The result is a large, polycyclic molecule with a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core fused to two additional ring systems. This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 1.\n*   **Reagents**: Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Analysis**: These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) is cleaved and replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2**: The structure is the same as Product 1, but with a secondary alcohol group at the C7 position. The C₂ symmetry is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2.\n*   **Reagents**: SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (the Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Analysis**: This is a mild oxidation that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.

This thermal reaction will induce a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction, causing Product 3 to decompose into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: `o-quinodimethane`.\n    2.  One molecule of the modified dienophile core: `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n*   **Subsequent Reactions of Intermediates**:\n    *   `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a retro-cheletropic reaction to extrude a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   The two molecules of the highly reactive `o-quinodimethane` dimerize. The major thermal product of this dimerization is the [4+4] cycloadduct: **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene**.\n*   **Final Product 4**: The stable, major organic product of this final step is the dimer of o-quinodimethane.\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n*   **Structure**: Product 4 is `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`. This molecule has two benzene rings linked by two ethylene bridges (`-CH₂-CH₂-`), forming a central 8-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is not planar. The 8-membered ring adopts a stable, puckered conformation (a twist-boat) that possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This axis relates the two identical halves of the molecule (one benzene ring and one ethylene bridge) to each other.\n*   **Counting Unique Environments**: Due to this symmetry, we only need to analyze the hydrogens on one half of the molecule.\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens**: We consider one of the `ortho`-disubstituted benzene rings. Because the overall molecule is three-dimensional and lacks a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring, the four hydrogen atoms on this ring are all in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens**: We consider one of the ethylene bridges (`-CH₂-CH₂-`). The two CH₂ groups in the bridge are in different environments. Furthermore, the two hydrogens on any single CH₂ group (geminal protons) are diastereotopic because of the chirality of the molecule. This means they are also chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, all four hydrogen atoms on a single `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge are chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the unique aromatic and aliphatic types.\nTotal distinct hydrogens = 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = 8.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, we must first deduce the structure of each intermediate product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction from starting materials to Product 1**\n*   **Reactant 1**: `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` is a norbornadiene derivative. It has two double bonds and is an excellent dienophile for Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reactant 2**: `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` in the presence of sodium iodide (NaI). This specific name is unusual, but the combination of a `bis(dibromomethyl)` precursor with NaI is a classic method for generating a highly reactive diene in situ. The most common and analogous reaction is the treatment of `1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene` with NaI to form `o-quinodimethane` (o-xylylene). We will assume this is the reactive species generated.\n*   **Reaction**: A double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Two equivalents of `o-quinodimethane` (the diene) react with the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative (the dienophile).\n*   **Product 1**: The result is a large, polycyclic molecule where the central norbornane skeleton is fused with two benzo-barrelene type structures. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 1.\n*   **Reagents**: Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Reaction**: These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy (-OtBu) group at the C7 position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 2**: The structure is the same as Product 1, but it is now a secondary alcohol at C7. The C₂ symmetry is retained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2.\n*   **Reagents**: SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation.\n*   **Reaction**: This is a mild oxidation that converts a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The C7 hydroxyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Product 3**: Product 3 is a ketone. The overall C₂ symmetric polycyclic framework remains intact.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 3.\n*   **Condition**: Heating to 150 °C.\n*   **Reaction**: Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, is favored by high temperatures.\n    1.  Product 3 undergoes a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking down into its constituent parts: two molecules of `o-quinodimethane` and one molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    2.  `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a retro-cheletropic reaction, extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    3.  The two molecules of the highly reactive `o-quinodimethane` dimerize. The major product of this thermal dimerization is the [4+4] cycloadduct, which is **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene**.\n*   **Product 4**: The stable organic product referred to as \"4\" is `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms on Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure**: Product 4, `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`, consists of two benzene rings bridged by two ethylene (`-CH₂-CH₂-`) linkers, forming a central 8-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry**: The central 8-membered ring is not planar; it adopts a rigid, puckered conformation. Experimental evidence shows that the stable ground-state conformation at room temperature possesses **C₂ symmetry**. The C₂ axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two identical halves (one benzene ring and one ethylene bridge) to each other.\n*   **Signal Analysis**: Because of this symmetry, we only need to analyze the protons on one half of the molecule.\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons**: Let's consider one of the `ortho`-disubstituted benzene rings. Due to the rigid C₂ symmetry of the entire molecule, this benzene ring itself does not have a local plane of symmetry. Therefore, all four of its hydrogen atoms are in chemically different environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Protons**: Let's consider one of the ethylene bridges (`-CH₂-CH₂-`). Because of the C₂ symmetry, the two `CH₂` groups within this bridge are in non-equivalent positions. Furthermore, within each `CH₂` group, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic (due to the overall chirality of the C₂ conformer) and thus are also non-equivalent. This means all four protons on a single ethylene bridge are chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count**: The total number of unique proton environments is the sum of the aromatic and aliphatic signals: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The intermediate `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and spontaneously loses a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) via a retro-cheletropic reaction to form the stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n    3.  The two molecules of the highly reactive `o-quinodimethane` dimerize. The major product of this thermal dimerization is the [4+4] cycloaddition product, **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene**.\n*   **Product 4**: The stable organic molecule \"Product 4\" is the dimer, `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure**: The final product, `5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`, consists of two benzene rings linked by two ethylene bridges (`-CH₂-CH₂-`), forming a central 8-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry**: This molecule is not planar. The 8-membered ring adopts a puckered, rigid conformation which possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This axis relates the two identical halves of the molecule to each other.\n*   **Analysis of a Single Half**: Due to the C₂ symmetry, we only need to count the unique protons on one half of the molecule.\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens**: Consider one `ortho`-disubstituted benzene ring. Because the overall molecule is three-dimensional and rigid, there is no local plane of symmetry bisecting this ring. Therefore, all four hydrogen atoms on this one ring are in different chemical environments. This gives **4 unique aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens**: Consider one ethylene bridge (`-CH₂-CH₂-`). The two CH₂ groups are not equivalent. Furthermore, the two protons on each CH₂ group (geminal protons) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, all four hydrogen atoms on a single ethylene bridge are chemically distinct from one another. This gives **4 unique aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count**: The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the unique aromatic and aliphatic types:\n    Total = 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**\n\nThere are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
