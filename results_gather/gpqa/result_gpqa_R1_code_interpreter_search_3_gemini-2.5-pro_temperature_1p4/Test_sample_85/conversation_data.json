    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **pyran-2-one:** This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (making it a pyran derivative) and a carbonyl group at the C-2 position. A cyclic ester is called a lactone; this specific one is a δ-lactone.\n*   **tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C-4 position of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 4 (C4) is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups (H, ethyl group, C3, and C5 of the ring). The problem specifies the configuration of this stereocenter as (R) for the product of the first reaction and (S) for the product of the second reaction.\n\nThe structure is a six-membered ring formed by O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-. The carbon with the ethyl group is the stereocenter.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is slightly non-standard, it unambiguously describes a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (also known as 3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\nLet's deduce the structure:\n*   The parent chain is a pentanedioic acid backbone: HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH.\n*   A \"3-ethyl\" group is placed on the central carbon: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\n*   One of the -COOH groups is converted to an isobutyl ester (-COO-CH2CH(CH3)2). This gives the molecule two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n*   The structure is: **HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl**.\n*   The stereocenter is the C3 of the acid chain (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is much less reactive towards LiBH₄ because it first gets deprotonated to form a carboxylate salt, which resists reduction.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at one end of molecule A to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    `A: (X)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` → `Intermediate: (X)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the cyclic ester (lactone). This forms the six-membered ring product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the stereocenter at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must be the same as the stereochemistry of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be the **(R)-isomer**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a reducing agent, often used as its THF complex (BH₃·THF). It has the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄; it selectively and rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while reacting much more slowly with esters.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group of molecule B to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.\n    `B: (Y)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` → `Intermediate: (Y)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the ester group, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone. This also forms the six-membered ring product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, these steps do not involve the stereocenter. The stereochemistry of starting material B is retained in the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)-isomer**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of different reducing agents towards carboxylic acids and esters, as well as the conservation of stereochemistry in reactions that do not involve the chiral center.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a δ-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carboxyl-based functional groups: a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which bears the ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂\n\n**2. Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid first reacts with the hydride source to form a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻), which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group in compound A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains intact.\n        *   (Stereoisomer A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl  --LiBH₄-->  (Intermediate) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The terminal hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone ring and eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and the subsequent cyclization occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5 of the pentanoic acid derivative). The chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product) is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product has the (R) configuration, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration. So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**3. Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent, but with the opposite preference to LiBH₄. Borane selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group in compound B to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains intact.\n        *   (Stereoisomer B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl --BH₃--> (Intermediate) HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester, forming the six-membered lactone ring and eliminating a molecule of isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not involve the chiral center at C3. Its configuration is retained in the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product has the (S) configuration, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration. So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B is the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This question requires understanding the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.

This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-isobutyl`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other.

The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and cyclization) occur at the ends of the carbon chain (C1 and C5), far from the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction sequence. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product has the (R) configuration, the starting material A must also have had the (R) configuration.
