    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$).\n    The relationship is given by: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two systems:\n    - Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    - Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude of a star in a system with a single planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a_* \\sin i}{P}$\n    where:\n    - $P$ is the orbital period.\n    - $a_*$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass.\n    - $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ is edge-on).\n\n    From the definition of the center of mass, $M_* a_* = M_p a_p$, and since the planet's orbital semi-major axis is $a = a_* + a_p$, we can write $a_* = a \\frac{M_p}{M_* + M_p}$. Given that the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_*$), we can approximate $M_* + M_p \\approx M_*$, so $a_* \\approx a \\frac{M_p}{M_*}$.\n\n    From Kepler's Third Law, $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_*+M_p)}$. Again, with $M_p \\ll M_*$, we have $P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G M_*}$.\n    From this, we can express the semi-major axis $a$ in terms of the period $P$:\n    $a \\approx \\left(\\frac{G M_* P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for $a_*$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K$:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sin i}{P} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{G M_* P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\right]$\n    Simplifying this expression yields:\n    $K \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{M_*^2}\\right)^{1/3} M_p \\sin(i) P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Form the Ratio for the Two Systems:**\n    We can see that $K$ is proportional to $P^{-1/3}$, assuming all other parameters are constant.\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n    We are given that the stars have the same mass ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). The problem does not mention the orbital inclinations ($i_1, i_2$), so we make the standard assumption in such problems that they are the same. With these conditions, the relation simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n    Therefore, we can write the ratio for the two systems as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    Now, calculate the numerical value:\n    $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.36443$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final numerical value for confirmation.\nratio_K1_K2 = 5 / 7\nratio_P2_P1 = ratio_K1_K2**3\nprint(f'{ratio_P2_P1:.2f}')\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36\n</execute_result>\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "This problem requires relating the observed Doppler shift of a star to the orbital period of its exoplanet. Here is the logical breakdown:\n\n**1. Relate Observable Data to Physical Quantities:**\nThe method used is the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The observed quantity is the periodic shift of a spectral line, $\\Delta\\lambda$. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star moves towards and away from us. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\n*   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   For Planet #1, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n*   For Planet #2, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the orbital period ($P$) and other system parameters by the following equation:\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**3.

In such problems, unless otherwise specified, it is standard to assume the systems are observed under similar conditions, meaning their orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\nSince $M_p$, $M_*$, and $i$ are the same for both systems, all terms in the equation except $K$ and $P$ are constant.
