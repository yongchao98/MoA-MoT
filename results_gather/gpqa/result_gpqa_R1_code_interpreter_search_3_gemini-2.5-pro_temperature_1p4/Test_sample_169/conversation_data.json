    "An electron is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be represented by a two-component vector (a spinor) in a 2D complex Hilbert space.\n\n**1. Define the Spin State Vector**\n\nThe given spin state is `|ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)`. We can write this as a column vector:\n`|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\n\nWhere `T` denotes the transpose, `i` is the imaginary unit.\n\n**2. Normalize the State Vector**\n\nFor any calculation of physical observables like expectation values, the state vector must be normalized. A state `|ψ⟩` is normalized if the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1`.\n\nFirst, let's find the inner product of the given unnormalized state with itself. The corresponding \"bra\" vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector `|ψ⟩`.\n\n`⟨ψ| = [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [-3i, 4]`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i^2 + 16 = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\nThe norm of the vector is `sqrt(⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = sqrt(25) = 5`.\n\nTo normalize the state, we divide the vector by its norm:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]^T`\nAnd the normalized bra vector is:\n`⟨ψ_norm| = (1/5) * [-3i, 4]`\n\n**3. Define the Spin Operator**\n\nThe spin operator for the y-direction, `S_y`, is given by:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli y-matrix.\n\nGiven `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, the `S_y` operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of `S_y` is calculated using the formula:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩`\n\nLet's first compute the action of the operator `S_y` on the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`S_y |ψ_norm⟩ = ( (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ) * ( (1/5) * [3i, 4]^T )`\n`= (ħ/10) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`= (ħ/10) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T`\n`= (ħ/10) * [ -4i, 3i^2 ]^T`\n`= (ħ/10) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T`\n\nNow, we take the inner product of this resulting vector with `⟨ψ_norm|`:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| (S_y |ψ_norm⟩) = ( (1/5) * [-3i, 4] ) * ( (ħ/10) * [-4i, -3]^T )`\n`= (ħ/50) * [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T`\n`= (ħ/50) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`= (ħ/50) * ( 12i^2 - 12 )`\n`= (ħ/50) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`= (ħ/50) * ( -24 )`\n`= -24ħ / 50`\n`= -12ħ / 25`\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is `-12ħ/25`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 12*hbar/25\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use Python.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector psi = (3i, 4)\npsi = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the Pauli-y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j],\n                    [1j,  0]])\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the expectation value: <psi|sigma_y|psi>\n# psi.conj().T is the bra vector <psi|\nnumerator = psi.conj().T @ sigma_y @ psi\n\n# Calculate the denominator (normalization factor): <psi|psi>\ndenominator = psi.conj().T @ psi\n\n# The expectation value of sigma_y is numerator/denominator\nexp_val_sigma_y = numerator / denominator\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * <sigma_y>\n# The result will be in units of hbar/2. The problem's options are in units of hbar.\n# So, <S_y>/hbar = (1/2) * <sigma_y>\nexp_val_Sy_over_hbar = 0.5 * exp_val_sigma_y\n\n# The coefficients are -12/25\n# -12/25 = -0.48\n# Let's print the numerical result to compare\nprint(f\"Numerical result for <S_y>/hbar: {exp_val_Sy_over_hbar.real}\")\nprint(f\"Fraction -12/25: {-12/25}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nNumerical result for <S_y>/hbar: -0.48\nFraction -12/25: -0.48\n```\nThe python code confirms that the expectation value of `S_y` is `-12/25` in units of `ħ`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
