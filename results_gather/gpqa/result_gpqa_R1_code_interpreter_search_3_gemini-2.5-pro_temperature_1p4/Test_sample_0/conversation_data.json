    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nIn this context, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, each energy level is not a sharp line but has a certain \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE) given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n\nTo solve this, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem (electron-volts and seconds):\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nI will use a python script to verify the calculations.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ)\ndelta_E1 = hbar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n```\nEnergy width of State 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of State 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be larger than the width of the broader energy level.\n\n*   The broader level is the one with the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE).\n*   Comparing the two widths: ΔE₁ (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than ΔE₂ (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV). This is expected, as State 1 has a shorter lifetime.\n\nTherefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that satisfies this condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  10⁻⁴ is much greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷). This would be clearly resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:**  10⁻⁸ is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷.

    "This problem requires applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time to determine the minimum energy separation needed to distinguish between two quantum states.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nHere, ΔE represents the \"energy width\" or natural linewidth of the energy level. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy, but rather an energy distribution with a width. For a state to be clearly defined, its energy must be measured over a period comparable to its lifetime. We can approximate the relationship as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the energy width (in eV).\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state (in seconds).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2.

The Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two energy distributions will overlap so much that they appear as a single, broader level.\n\nWhen the two levels have different widths, the resolution is limited by the level with the *larger* energy width. In this case:\n\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁ (from the state with the shorter lifetime). Therefore, the condition to clearly resolve the two levels is:\n\nEnergy Difference |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow we compare the given options with this condition:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: Is 10⁻⁴ > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷? Yes. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: Is 10⁻⁸ > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷? No.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: Is 10⁻⁹ > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷? No.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: Is 10⁻¹¹ > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷? No.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference significantly larger than the broader energy width, allowing the two states to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is about the natural energy width of quantum states and the conditions required to distinguish between them. The core concept is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle connects the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) with its lifetime (τ). A state with a shorter lifetime has its energy defined less precisely, meaning it has a larger energy width. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy width (ΔE) as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant in units relevant to this problem is ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2.

State 1, with the shorter lifetime, is \"broader\" in energy than State 2.\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo be able to \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the separation between their central energies (let's call it the energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two energy distributions will overlap significantly and be indistinguishable.\n\nThe resolution is limited by the broader of the two levels. In this case, ΔE₁ (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than ΔE₂ (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV). Therefore, the condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is:\n\nEnergy Difference > ΔE₁\nEnergy Difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4.
