    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong, sharp peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and its position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) in this region (downfield of 10 ppm) is a definitive signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**O H**). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded, suggesting they are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are less deshielded, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group:** Now we analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to at least two different types of protons, making its signal complex.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H corresponds to a methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift (around 2.9 ppm) indicates it is a benzylic proton (i.e., the CH group is directly attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        1.  We have a benzylic CH group (from 2.9 ppm).\n        2.  The CH3 group at 1.4 ppm is a doublet, so it's attached to this benzylic CH.\n        3.  The CH3 group at 0.9 ppm is a triplet, so it's part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The CH2 part of this ethyl group is the signal at 1.7 ppm.\n        4.  This ethyl group must also be attached to the benzylic CH.\n        5.  This gives the structure: `Ring - CH(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Compound X**\n    *   Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A, but option A is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Reaction and the Final Product**\n    *   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This is a very powerful reducing agent combination. When it reacts with a carboxylic acid, it completely reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   Final Product: The benzene ring will now have a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. The name of this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our derived product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This structure is incorrect.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We need to determine the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals:\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton (a methine, -CH-) directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This doublet corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to the single proton (the methine group).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) which is adjacent to both the methyl group (making it a quartet) and the methine group (making it a doublet). The combined splitting results in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are a benzylic -CH-, a -CH₃ attached to it, and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) also attached to it. This forms a `CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. Its name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) directly attached to a benzene ring to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The sec-butyl group remains unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule has a sec-butyl group and a methyl group on the benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) relationship. The name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The substituent is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the deduced final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is structurally incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>",
