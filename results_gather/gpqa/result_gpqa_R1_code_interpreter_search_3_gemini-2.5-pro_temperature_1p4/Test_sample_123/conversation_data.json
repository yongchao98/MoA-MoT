    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and exponential decay of particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe number of particles, N, that remain after a time 't' from an initial sample N₀ is given by the exponential decay law:\n$N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$\nwhere τ is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n\nIn this problem, the particles are moving at relativistic speeds. This means we must distinguish between the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, the lifetime in its own rest frame) and its lifetime as observed in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$). Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\nThe decay law in the lab frame is:\n$N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}} = N_0 e^{-t/(\\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n**2. Analyze the First Scenario**\n\n*   Detector radius, R = 30 m.\n*   The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    $t \\approx R/c$\n*   Initial Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = 20$.\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, $N_1/N_0 = 1/3$.\n\nWe can plug these values into our decay equation:\n$1/3 = e^{-(R/c)/(\\gamma_1 \\tau_0)}$\n$1/3 = e^{-R/(c \\gamma_1 \\tau_0)}$\n\nLet's substitute the known value for $\\gamma_1$:\n$1/3 = e^{-R/(20 c \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo solve for the unknown part, $R/(c \\tau_0)$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(1/3) = -R/(20 c \\tau_0)$\n$-\\ln(3) = -R/(20 c \\tau_0)$\n$R/(c \\tau_0) = 20 \\ln(3)$\n\nThe term $R/(c \\tau_0)$ is a constant that depends on the detector setup and the type of particle.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Scenario**\n\n*   We want to find the new Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$.\n*   The desired fraction of particles reaching the detector is $N_2/N_0 = 2/3$.\n*   The distance R and proper lifetime τ₀ remain the same.\n\nWe set up the same decay equation for the new scenario:\n$2/3 = e^{-R/(c \\gamma_2 \\tau_0)}$\n\nWe already found the value of the constant term $R/(c \\tau_0) = 20 \\ln(3)$. Let's substitute it into the equation:\n$2/3 = e^{-(20 \\ln(3))/\\gamma_2}$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma_2$. Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(2/3) = -(20 \\ln(3))/\\gamma_2$\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = -(20 \\ln(3)) / \\ln(2/3)$\n$\\gamma_2 = -(20 \\ln(3)) / (\\ln(2) - \\ln(3))$\n$\\gamma_2 = (20 \\ln(3)) / (\\ln(3) - \\ln(2))$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$\\gamma_2 = (20 \\ln(3)) / \\ln(3/2)$\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nWe can now compute the value of $\\gamma_2$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.18.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Particle Decay and Time Dilation**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial sample, N₀, after a time, t, is described by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$\n*   Here, $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab than their lifetime in their own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). This effect is called time dilation and is given by the formula: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n*   Here, $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n*   **Combining the formulas:** We can substitute the time-dilated lifetime into the decay equation: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/(\\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n**2. Define the Time of Flight**\n\n*   The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius R = 30 m.\n*   They are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity, v, is extremely close to the speed of light, c. We can approximate $v \\approx c$.\n*   The time, t, it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the inner wall is the time of flight: $t = R/v \\approx R/c$\n\n**3. Set Up the Equation for the First Scenario**\n\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector: $N/N_0 = 1/3$.\n*   Initial Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_1 = 20$.\n*   Radius: R = 30 m.\n\nSubstitute these values and the time of flight into the combined decay equation:\n$1/3 = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma_1 \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma_1 \\tau_0)}$\n$1/3 = e^{-R / (20 c \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo solve for the unknown constant term, $R/(c\\tau_0)$, which encapsulates the particle's properties and the detector's size, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(1/3) = -R / (20 c \\tau_0)$\n$-\\ln(3) = -R / (20 c \\tau_0)$\n$R / (c \\tau_0) = 20 \\ln(3)$\n\nThis value is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup.\n\n**4. Set Up the Equation for the Second Scenario**\n\n*   Desired fraction of particles reaching the detector: $N/N_0 = 2/3$.\n*   The new Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, is what we need to find.\n*   The constant term, $R/(c\\tau_0)$, remains the same.\n\nThe equation for this new scenario is:\n$2/3 = e^{-R / (c \\gamma_2 \\tau_0)}$\n\nNow, substitute the constant value we found in the previous step:\n$2/3 = e^{-(20 \\ln(3)) / \\gamma_2}$\n\n**5. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\nTo isolate $\\gamma_2$, we again take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(2/3) = -(20 \\ln(3)) / \\gamma_2$\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = - (20 \\ln(3)) / \\ln(2/3)$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$:\n$\\gamma_2 = - (20 \\ln(3)) / (\\ln(2) - \\ln(3))$\n$\\gamma_2 = (20 \\ln(3)) / (\\ln(3) - \\ln(2))$\nAnd using the property $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$ again:\n$\\gamma_2 = (20 \\ln(3)) / \\ln(3/2)$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of $\\gamma_2$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2 based on the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18841443905321\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19.
