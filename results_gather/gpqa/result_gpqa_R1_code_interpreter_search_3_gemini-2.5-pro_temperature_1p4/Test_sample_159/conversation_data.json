    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem concerning Fraunhofer diffraction.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Geometry:** The problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'a' of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall the Theory:** The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` of the light at an angle `θ` relative to the central axis is given by the formula:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ 2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern (θ=0).\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, given by `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\n3.  **Locate the Minima:** The intensity minima (the dark rings in the pattern) occur at angles `θ` where the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`. Let `z_n` be the n-th positive zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The condition for the minima becomes:\n    `k * a * θ_n = z_n`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angular Position of the Minima:** We substitute `k = 2π / λ` into the equation:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum, we get:\n    `θ_n = (z_n * λ) / (2π * a) = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ (z₂ / (2π)) - (z₁ / (2π)) ] * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function and Compute the Coefficient:** We need the values of the first two positive zeros (`z₁` and `z₂`) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. We can use a scientific library to find these accurately and compute the final coefficient.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Find the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1 (J1).\n# The jn_zeros function returns an array of the first 'nt' zeros of the function J_nu.\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = zeros[0]\nz2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance: (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"The first zero (z1) is: {z1:.5f}\")\nprint(f\"The second zero (z2) is: {z2:.5f}\")\nprint(f\"The angular distance is delta_theta = coefficient * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The calculated coefficient is: {coefficient:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe first zero (z1) is: 3.83171\nThe second zero (z2) is: 7.01559\nThe angular distance is delta_theta = coefficient * (lambda / a)\nThe calculated coefficient is: 0.5068\n\nThe calculation shows that the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.5068 * (λ / a)`.\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    A) 0.506 λ / a\n    B) 0.500 λ / a\n    C) 0.610 λ / a (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`, not the distance between minima.)\n    D) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to the Rayleigh criterion for the angular resolution, which is also based on the position of the first minimum.)\n\nThe calculated value of `0.5068 * (λ / a)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
