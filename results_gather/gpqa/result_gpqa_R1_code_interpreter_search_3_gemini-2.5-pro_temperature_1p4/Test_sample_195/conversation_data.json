    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The core principle we'll use is the conservation of total energy. In a relativistic system, the total energy of the particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest mass energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$). The total energy of the *system* is the sum of the particle's energy and its potential energy, $U(x)$.\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    This total energy must remain constant throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ corresponding to this force is:\n    $U(x) = \\int_0^x -F(x') dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Motion at Two Key Points:** We can equate the total energy of the system at two specific points in its oscillation:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude ($x=A$)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The particle's energy is $E_{particle} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 = mc^2$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position ($x=0$)**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The particle's energy is $E_{particle} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n        *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, we can set the energies from the two points equal to each other:\n    $E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A)$\n    $\\gamma_{max} mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $v_{max}$. First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation. First, invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression matches option (C) exactly.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    *   B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic limit)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n\n<<<C>>>",
