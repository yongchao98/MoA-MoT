    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay in a hydrogen atom, starting from the `|n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` state (3s state) and ending in the `|n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` state (1s ground state). The process occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The options suggest that the intermediate state is one of the `|n=2, l=1, m'⟩` states (2p states).\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    For a transition to be allowed, the change in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number, `Δn`: any integer (`n_initial ≠ n_final`).\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number, `Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1`.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number, `Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition: `|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`**\n    *   Initial state: `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩`, so `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n    *   The options specify the intermediate state has `n'=2`.\n    *   Applying the `Δl` selection rule: `l' = l + Δl = 0 ± 1`. Since `l` cannot be negative, we must have `l' = 1`. This confirms the intermediate state is a p-state (`l=1`).\n    *   Applying the `Δm` selection rule: `m' = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1)`. Thus, the possible values for `m'` are `0, +1, -1`.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition: `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`**\n    *   Final state: `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`, so `n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0`.\n    *   Let's check if transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed.\n    *   Intermediate state `l'=1`, final state `l_f=0`. So `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`. This is allowed.\n    *   `Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - m'`.\n        *   If `m'=-1`, `Δm = +1`. Allowed. Route: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`.\n        *   If `m'=0`, `Δm = 0`. Allowed. Route: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`.\n        *   If `m'=1`, `Δm = -1`. Allowed. Route: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`.\n    *   All three routes are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio: the fraction of atoms that decay via that specific channel.\n    The overall probability of the cascade `|i⟩ → |k⟩ → |f⟩` (where `|k⟩` is the intermediate state) is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, `P(|i⟩ → |k⟩) = Γ(|i⟩ → |k⟩) / Γ_total(|i⟩)`, assuming the intermediate state `|k⟩` decays to `|f⟩` with certainty. In our case, the 2p state (`|2,1,m'⟩`) can only decay to the 1s state (`|1,0,0⟩`) via a dipole transition, so the probability of the second step is 1 for any of the routes.\n    Therefore, we need to find the relative probabilities of the first transition: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩` for `m' = -1, 0, 1`.\n\n6.  **Use the Wigner-Eckart theorem for transition rates:**\n    The transition rate `Γ(|n,l,m⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩)` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    `Γ ∝ |⟨n',l',m'| **d** |n,l,m⟩|²`\n    Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The rate is proportional to:\n    `Γ ∝ |⟨n'l'||r||nl⟩|² × |⟨l,m; 1,q|l',m'⟩|²`\n    where `⟨...|...⟩` is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, `q = m' - m`, and `r` is the radial position operator.\n\n7.  **Apply to the first transition `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`:**\n    *   Initial state: `l=0, m=0`.\n    *   Final state: `l'=1`. `m'` can be `-1, 0, 1`.\n    *   The radial part, `|⟨2,1||r||3,0⟩|²`, is the same for all three possible final states.\n    *   The angular part depends on `m'`:\n        *   For `m'=1` (corresponds to `q=1`): We need `|⟨0,0; 1,1|1,1⟩|²`.\n        *   For `m'=0` (corresponds to `q=0`): We need `|⟨0,0; 1,0|1,0⟩|²`.\n        *   For `m'=-1` (corresponds to `q=-1`): We need `|⟨0,0; 1,-1|1,-1⟩|²`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:**\n    For coupling angular momenta `j₁=0` and `j₂=1`, the only possible total angular momentum is `J=1`. The corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients `⟨j₁,m₁; j₂,m₂|J,M⟩` are `⟨0,0; 1,m₂|1,m₂⟩ = 1`.\n    Therefore, for all three cases (`m'=-1, 0, 1`), the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is `1² = 1`.\n\n9.  **Determine the branching ratios:**\n    Since both the radial integral and the angular factor are the same for the transitions to `m'=-1`, `m'=0`, and `m'=1`, the transition rates are equal:\n    `Γ(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩)`\n    The total transition rate to the `n=2, l=1` manifold is the sum of these three equal rates. The branching ratio for any one of these paths is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\n    `Probability = Γ / (Γ + Γ + Γ) = Γ / (3Γ) = 1/3`.\n    This means that each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` is a valid path, and its probability is `1/3`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the correct transition route and its probability.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Process**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step de-excitation of a hydrogen atom. This is a cascade decay process.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 1s (ground) state.\n*   **Process:** The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is a real intermediate state, $|k\\rangle$.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the correct path (i.e., the intermediate state $|k\\rangle$) and the probability (branching ratio) of that specific path.\n\n### **2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor a transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the electric dipole interaction, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n1.  **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Angular momentum conservation:** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($n \\neq n'$).\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Transition Path**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the two steps of the decay.\n\n**Step 1: First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$)**\n\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1$. Since the orbital quantum number must be non-negative ($l' \\ge 0$), we must have $l'=1$. So the intermediate state must be a 2p state. This is consistent with all the options.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. Thus, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state are $m' = -1, 0, +1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition ($|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ ($m'=-1$), then $\\Delta m = +1$. This is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,0\\rangle$ ($m'=0$), then $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,1\\rangle$ ($m'=1$), then $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n\n**Conclusion:** All three decay routes are possible according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the intermediate 2p state can only decay to the 1s state via an E1 transition.\n\nThe rate of an electric dipole transition is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle k | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function is spherically symmetric. Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the available magnetic sublevels of the final state. The three final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) are degenerate in the absence of an external magnetic field.\n\nThus, the transition rates to each of the three possible intermediate states must be equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total transition rate from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is the sum of the rates to each sublevel:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$\n\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for any single one of these channels is the rate for that channel divided by the total rate:\n$P(\\text{one channel}) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis means each of the three allowed paths has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **5. Final Check**\n\nLet's review the options based on our findings:\n*   A) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   B) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n*   C) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   D) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, and the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n\nThe correct route and probability combination is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1.

Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$. This means the intermediate state must be a 'p' state. All options correctly identify the intermediate state as having $l=1$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. Thus, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state are $m' = -1, 0, +1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition ($|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n\n*   Final state quantum numbers: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed change.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ ($m'=-1$), then $\\Delta m = -(-1) = +1$. This is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,0\\rangle$ ($m'=0$), then $\\Delta m = 0$.

This is allowed.\n\n**Conclusion:** All three decay routes proposed in the options are physically possible according to the selection rules. The problem is to find the probability of a specific route.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the intermediate 2p state can only decay to the 1s state via an E1 transition. We need to find the relative rates of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element. By the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this can be split into a radial part and an angular part.\n$ \\Gamma \\propto |\\langle n'l'||r||nl\\rangle|^2 \\times |\\langle l,m; 1,q|l',m'\\rangle|^2 $\nwhere $\\langle ... \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\nLet's analyze the factors for the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   **Radial Part:** The radial integral $\\int R_{21}^*(r) r R_{30}(r) r^2 dr$ depends only on $n, l, n', l'$. It is the same for all three destination states since they only differ in $m'$.\n*   **Angular Part:** The angular part is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling the initial state's angular momentum ($l=0$) with the photon's angular momentum (dipole photon, so $L=1$) to get the final state's angular momentum ($l'=1$). The relevant coefficient is $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$. For coupling any angular momentum with $l=0$, this coefficient is always 1.\n\nSince both the radial and angular parts of the calculation are identical for the transitions to $m'=-1, 0, 1$, the transition rates must be equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nAlternatively, a simpler symmetry argument can be used:\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In the absence of any external fields, space is isotropic (there is no preferred direction). Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the available degenerate sublevels of the final p-state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n\nSince there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (branching ratio) for any single one of them is:\n$ P(\\text{any single route}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of desired routes}}{\\text{Total number of possible routes}} = \\frac{1}{3} $\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid decay route.\n*   The probability of this specific route occurring is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n<<<D>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct transition route and its probability.\n\n### **1. Understand the Process**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step de-excitation of a hydrogen atom. This is a cascade decay process.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 1s (ground) state.\n*   **Process:** The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is a real intermediate state, $|k\\rangle$.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the correct path (i.e., the intermediate state $|k\\rangle$) and the probability (branching ratio) of that specific path.\n\n### **2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor a transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the electric dipole interaction, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n1.  **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Angular momentum conservation:** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($n \\neq n'$).\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Transition Path**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the two steps of the decay.\n\n**Step 1: First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$)**\n\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1$. Since the orbital quantum number must be non-negative ($l' \\ge 0$), we must have $l'=1$. So the intermediate state must be a 2p state. This is consistent with all the options.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. Thus, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state are $m' = -1, 0, +1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition ($|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ ($m'=-1$), then $\\Delta m = +1$. This is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,0\\rangle$ ($m'=0$), then $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,1\\rangle$ ($m'=1$), then $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n\n**Conclusion:** All three decay routes are possible according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the intermediate 2p state can only decay to the 1s state via an E1 transition.\n\nWe need to find the relative rates of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states. A powerful argument can be made from symmetry:\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$), which means its wave function is spherically symmetric.\n*   In the absence of any external fields (which is assumed unless stated otherwise), space is isotropic, meaning there is no preferred direction.\n*   The three possible final states of the first transition, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy.\n\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of space, the atom has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the available degenerate sublevels of the final state.\n\nTherefore, the transition rates to each of the three possible intermediate states must be equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total transition rate from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is the sum of the rates to each sublevel:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$\n\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for any single one of these channels is the rate for that channel divided by the total rate:\n$P(\\text{one channel}) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis means each of the three allowed paths has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **5. Final Check**\n\nLet's review the options based on our findings:\n*   A) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   B) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n*   C) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   D) Path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, and the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n\nThe correct route and probability combination is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
