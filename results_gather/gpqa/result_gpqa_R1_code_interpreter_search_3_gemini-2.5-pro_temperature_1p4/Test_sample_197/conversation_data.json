The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given as c(Co) = 10^-2 M. The species are:\n    *   Free Co(II) ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+`      ; β1 = `[[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-])` = 9\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]`     ; β2 = `[[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2)` = 40\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-`    ; β3 = `[[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3)` = 63\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-`   ; β4 = `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4)` = 16\n\n3.  **Set up the mass balance equation for cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    c(Co) = `[Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n4.  **Express concentrations in terms of the free Co(II) ion:**\n    Using the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n5.  **Substitute into the mass balance equation:**\n    c(Co) = `[Co^2+] + (β1[Co^2+][SCN-]) + (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) + (β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3) + (β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n    c(Co) = `[Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distribution coefficient (α):**\n    The fraction (αn) of any single species `[Co(SCN)n]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration c(Co).

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and equilibria:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given as `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`. The species present are:\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n2.  **Understand the stability constants (β):**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn), which relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n3.  **Write the mass balance equation for cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all individual cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n4.  **Express total concentration in terms of the free cobalt ion:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the mass balance equation:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1[Co^2+][SCN-]) + (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) + (β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3) + (β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the distribution coefficient (α) for the desired species:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex. This percentage is the fraction of this species (its distribution coefficient, α₂) multiplied by 100.\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving an expression that only depends on the known stability constants and the ligand concentration:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    The problem states `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`. This is a reasonable assumption for the free ligand concentration because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (`0.1 M >> 10^-2 M`), so the amount of `SCN-` that gets bound into complexes is negligible compared to the total `SCN-` concentration.\n\n6.  **Perform the numerical calculation:**\n    To simplify the calculation, let's calculate the denominator (let's call it D) first.\n    *   `D = 1 + (β1 * 0.1) + (β2 * 0.1^2) + (β3 * 0.1^3) + (β4 * 0.1^4)`\n    *   `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    *   `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    *   `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, calculate the numerator for `α2`:\n    *   `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate `α2`:\n    *   `α2 = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    Finally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\n    *   Percentage = `α2 * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n    This value corresponds to option C.

We can plug these values directly into the formula for `α2`.\n\n    *   Calculate the numerator:\n        `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   Calculate the denominator:\n        `Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1^1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    *   Calculate `α2` and the percentage:\n        `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n        Percentage = `α2 * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%, which corresponds to option C.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can verify this calculation using a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator in the distribution coefficient formula for the desired species, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all possible species (from n=0 to n=4)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482278\n</execute_result>\nThe script confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
