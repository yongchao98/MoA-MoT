    "The user wants to find the comoving distance to a quasar given its spectral properties and a specific cosmological model.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Interpret the Astrophysical Observation:** The problem states that the spectrum of a quasar has a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, and for wavelengths shorter than this, the flux drops significantly. This spectral feature is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line in high-redshift objects. The sharp drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is caused by the absorption of light by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds along the line of sight, an effect known as the Lyman-alpha forest. The peak at 790 nm can, therefore, be identified as the redshifted Lyα line.\n\n2.  **Determine the Redshift (z):** The redshift `z` of an object relates the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) of a spectral line to its rest-frame wavelength (`λ_rest`). The formula is:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n    The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen is a well-known value: `λ_rest = 121.6 nm`.\n    Given the observed wavelength `λ_obs = 790 nm`, we can calculate the redshift:\n    `z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1`\n\n3.  **Use the Cosmological Model:** The problem specifies a flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) model with the following parameters:\n    *   Hubble constant, `H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹`\n    *   Matter density parameter, `Ω_m = 0.3`\n    *   Dark energy density parameter, `Ω_Λ = 0.7`\n    *   Since `Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1`, the universe is flat as stated.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Comoving Distance:** The comoving distance (`D_c`) is the proper distance between two objects at a fixed cosmological time (in this case, the present time, where the scale factor `a=1`). For a flat ΛCDM universe, it is calculated by integrating over redshift:\n    `D_c = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')`\n    where:\n    *   `D_H` is the Hubble distance, `D_H = c / H₀`, with `c` being the speed of light.\n    *   `E(z)` is the dimensionless Hubble parameter, given by `E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ)`.\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** This integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be computed numerically. We can use a Python script with scientific libraries (`scipy`) to perform this calculation.\n\n    *   **Step 1:** Calculate the redshift `z`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Calculate the Hubble distance `D_H`.\n    *   **Step 3:** Define the integrand `1 / E(z')`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Numerically integrate the function from 0 to `z`.\n    *   **Step 5:** Multiply the result of the integral by `D_H` to get the comoving distance in Mpc.\n    *   **Step 6:** Convert the distance from Mpc to Gpc (1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc) and compare it with the given options.\n\nThis entire calculation can be efficiently performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the physical and cosmological constants\nlambda_obs = 790.0  # Observed wavelength in nm\nlambda_rest_lya = 121.6  # Rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength in nm\nH0 = 70.0  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nomega_m = 0.3  # Matter density parameter\nomega_lambda = 0.7  # Dark energy density parameter\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the redshift (z)\nz = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest_lya) - 1\n\n# Define the inverse of the dimensionless Hubble parameter, E(z)\n# This is the integrand for the comoving distance calculation\ndef integrand(z_prime):\n    return 1.0 / np.sqrt(omega_m * (1 + z_prime)**3 + omega_lambda)\n\n# Perform the numerical integration from 0 to z\nintegral_value, integral_error = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n\n# Calculate the Hubble distance in Mpc\nDh = c / H0\n\n# Calculate the comoving distance in Mpc\nDc_mpc = Dh * integral_value\n\n# Convert the comoving distance to Gpc\nDc_gpc = Dc_mpc / 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"The calculated redshift is z = {z:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The comoving distance is {Dc_gpc:.2f} Gpc\")\n```\n>>>",
