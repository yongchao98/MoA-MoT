    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n        *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n        *   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The final state we are interested in is the one where the measurement yields specific eigenvalues.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_{l1}\\hbar$. We want this to be $-\\hbar$, which means $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_{l2}\\hbar$. We want this to be $-\\hbar$, which means $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is described in the uncoupled basis as $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability**\n    In quantum mechanics, the probability of a system in an initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ being found in a final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ after a measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2$.\n    In our case, this is:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    A fundamental principle in this problem is the relationship between the total and individual angular momentum components. The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The corresponding quantum numbers are related by: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    *   For the **initial state** $|\\psi\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total z-component quantum number is $m = -1$. This means the state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   For the **target final state** $|\\phi\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, the individual z-component quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. The total z-component quantum number for this state would be $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Result**\n    The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m = -1$. The desired final state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m_{final} = -2$.\n    The measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is an internal process and does not change the total z-component of the angular momentum of the system. Therefore, the total quantum number $m$ must be conserved.\n    Since the initial state has $m = -1$, any possible outcome of the measurement of $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ must satisfy the condition $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$.\n    The outcome we are interested in is $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (-1, -1)$, which gives a sum of -2. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome is impossible.\n\n5.  **Formal Conclusion using Orthogonality**\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ can be written as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|1, m_{l1}; 1, m_{l2}\\rangle$ but only for those pairs where $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible pairs are $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\n    The state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is not part of this expansion.\n    Formally, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and the final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Because the eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal:\n    $\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis: $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   This means the two electrons are in p-orbitals ($l_1=1, l_2=1$).\n        *   Their total orbital angular momentum is $l=2$.\n        *   The z-component of their total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome. The measurement is of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $m_l\\hbar$ for an individual electron corresponds to the quantum number $m_l$. So, for the desired outcome, we must have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   This outcome corresponds to the uncoupled basis state: $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Probability Calculation:**\n    The probability, $P$, of measuring the outcome represented by state $|\\phi\\rangle$ when the system is initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2$\n    Substituting our states:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n    The term inside the brackets, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$\n    This means the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers must also add up:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n    This relationship acts as a \"selection rule\". A coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$, but *only* if they satisfy the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n4.  **Check the Selection Rule:**\n    *   For the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, the individual quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of the final state's quantum numbers matches the initial state's total quantum number:\n        $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   We see that the sum is -2, but the total m-quantum number of the initial state is -1. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The violation of the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ means that the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In more formal terms, these two states are orthogonal with respect to the total $L_z$ operator because they have different eigenvalues ($-2\\hbar$ and $-1\\hbar$, respectively).\n    Therefore, their inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n    And the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nIt is impossible to measure individual z-components that sum to a value different from the total z-component of the initial state.\n\n<<<A>>>",
