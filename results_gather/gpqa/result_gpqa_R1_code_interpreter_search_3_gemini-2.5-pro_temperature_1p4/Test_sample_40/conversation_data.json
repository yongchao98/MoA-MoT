    "This is a classic problem in special relativity that involves the addition of velocities. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Define the Frames of Reference**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the two relevant frames of reference:\n\n*   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n*   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass at a constant velocity.\n\n**2.

The problem gives this as `v`.\n*   **u':** The velocity of the light beam as measured *within* the glass (i.e., in the glass's own frame of reference, S'). This is the speed of light in the glass medium itself.\n*   **u:** The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n**3. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass Frame (u')**\n\nThe index of refraction of a material, `n`, is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that material (`u'`).\n\nThe formula is: `n = c / u'`\n\nThe problem states that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Substituting this value into the formula gives:\n\n`n = 1 / u'`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `u'`, the speed of light as measured within the glass frame:\n\n`u' = 1/n`\n\n**4. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\nTo find the speed of light as seen by the observer in the laboratory (`u`), we cannot simply add the velocities (`v + u'`) as we would in classical mechanics. We must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nSince we are given `c = 1`, the formula simplifies to:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v)`\n\n**5. Substitute and Simplify**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `u'` (which is `1/n`) into the velocity addition formula:\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v )`\n\nThis is a complex fraction. To simplify it, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n`u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\nNow, distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\nNumerator: `n*(1/n) + n*v = 1 + n*v`\nDenominator: `n*1 + n*(v/n) = n + v`\n\nCombining the simplified numerator and denominator, we get the final result:\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
