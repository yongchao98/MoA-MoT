    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Knowns and Unknowns\n**Given:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus at rest: `E_M = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The more massive fragment `m1` has a rest mass twice that of the lighter fragment `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   `T1` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n\n**To find:**\n*   The difference between the relativistic `T1` (`T1_rel`) and the classical `T1` (`T1_classical`).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Q-value\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\nFrom the given relations:\n*   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n*   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This Q-value is entirely converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T_total = T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (T1_rel)\nIn relativistic mechanics, we must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, we can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2`.\nKinetic energy is `T = E - m_0c^2`, so `E = T + m_0c^2`.\nSubstituting E gives: `(pc)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)`.\n\nSince `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2c^2)`\n\nWe also know `T2_rel = Q - T1_rel = 3 - T1_rel`. Substituting this into the equation:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2*(3 - T1_rel)*(99)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = (9 - 6*T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (594 - 198*T1_rel)`\n\nThe `T1_rel^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1_rel = 9 - 6*T1_rel + 594 - 198*T1_rel`\n`396*T1_rel = 603 - 204*T1_rel`\n`396*T1_rel + 204*T1_rel = 603`\n`600*T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the massive fragment is `T1_rel = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Classical Calculation of T1 (T1_classical)\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives the ratio of kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still `Q = 3 GeV`.\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# All energies are in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Relativistic calculation of T1\n# Solved from T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q-T1)^2 + 2*(Q-T1)*m2c2\n# This simplifies to T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2) / (2*Q + 2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2)\nT1_rel = (Q**2 + 2 * Q * m2c2) / (2 * Q + 2 * m1c2 + 2 * m2c2)\n\n# Classical calculation of T1\n# Solved from m1*T1 = m2*T2 and T1+T2=Q\n# This simplifies to T1 = (m2/(m1+m2)) * Q\nT1_classical = (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)) * Q\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_rel - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(difference_MeV)\n```\n\n5.0\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n\n### 1. Determine the rest masses of the fragments.\nWe are given:\n*   `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other)\n*   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass)\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, we can find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nLet's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of `m1`: `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of `m2`: `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final rest-mass energy. This difference in mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nSetting them equal:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nThis means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nSince `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the correct (relativistic) formula.\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of rest-mass energy `m_0c^2` and kinetic energy `T`, so `E = T + m_0c^2`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`(pc)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)`\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2c^2)`\n\nWe know that `T2_rel = Q - T1_rel = 3 - T1_rel`. Let's substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1_rel) * (99)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396 * T1_rel = (9 - 6 * T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (594 - 198 * T1_rel)`\n\nThe `T1_rel^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396 * T1_rel = 9 - 6 * T1_rel + 594 - 198 * T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel = 603 - 204 * T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel + 204 * T1_rel = 603`\n`600 * T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the difference.\nThe difference between the correct value (`T1_rel`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`) is:\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a detailed step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Given Information and Goals\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus, `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter fragment `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Goal: Find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_rel`) and its classically calculated kinetic energy (`T1_classical`).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies using `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`):\n    `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the decrease in rest-mass energy, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n`Q = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\nFrom this, we can relate their kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\nTherefore:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`\n\nUsing the mass ratio `m1 = 2*m2`:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m₀`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m₀c^2`. We can rearrange the energy-momentum relation to solve for momentum:\n`(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m₀c^2)^2 = (T + m₀c^2)^2 - (m₀c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m₀c^2)`\n\nConservation of momentum (`|p1| = |p2|`) means `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2c^2)`\n\nWe know that `T2_rel = Q - T1_rel = 3 GeV - T1_rel`. Let's substitute the known values (all in GeV):\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1_rel) * (99)`\n\nExpand the terms:\n`T1_rel^2 + 396 * T1_rel = (9 - 6 * T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (594 - 198 * T1_rel)`\n\nThe `T1_rel^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396 * T1_rel = 9 - 6 * T1_rel + 594 - 198 * T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel = 603 - 204 * T1_rel`\n\nNow, solve for `T1_rel`:\n`396 * T1_rel + 204 * T1_rel = 603`\n`600 * T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial Conditions and Relationships\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nFrom the given relationships, we can determine the rest-mass energy of each fragment. Let's work with rest-mass energies directly:\n*   `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n*   `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is `T_total = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`. We can write:\n*   `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n*   `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nTherefore:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\nThis means the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\nIn relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m₀` is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy `T` is `T = E - m₀c^2`.\nFrom these, we can derive the momentum-kinetic energy relation: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m₀c^2)`.\n\nAgain, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2c^2)`\n\nWe know that `T2_rel = Q - T1_rel = 3 - T1_rel`. Substituting this along with the rest-mass energies (all values in GeV):\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1_rel) * (99)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396 * T1_rel = (9 - 6 * T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (594 - 198 * T1_rel)`\n\nThe `T1_rel^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396 * T1_rel = 603 - 204 * T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel + 204 * T1_rel = 603`\n`600 * T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# All energies are in GeV.\n\n# Given initial rest-mass energy\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass.\n# Let this be the total final rest-mass energy.\nfinal_rest_mass_energy = 0.99 * Mc2\n\n# We are given that m1 = 2*m2, which means m1c2 = 2*m2c2.\n# So, m1c2 + m2c2 = final_rest_mass_energy\n# 2*m2c2 + m2c2 = final_rest_mass_energy\n# 3*m2c2 = final_rest_mass_energy\nm2c2 = final_rest_mass_energy / 3.0\nm1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2\n\n# The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy.\nQ = Mc2 - final_rest_mass_energy\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# In classical mechanics, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n# T1 + T2 = Q => T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# Conservation of momentum p1=p2 means (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2.\n# The relativistic relation is (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m0c^2).\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# Using T2 = Q - T1, we can solve for T1.\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c2\n# This simplifies to:\n# T1 * (2*Q + 2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2\nT1_rel = (Q**2 + 2 * Q * m2c2) / (2 * Q + 2 * m1c2 + 2 * m2c2)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution to find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1c^2` (more massive) and `m2c^2` (less massive), based on the given information.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which implies `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the total rest-mass energy of the fragments:\n        `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    2.  Substitute `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2` into the sum:\n        `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    3.  Find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n        `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released from the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Formula:** `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n*   **Calculation:**\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\n*   **Classical Formulas:**\n    *   Kinetic Energy: `T = p^2 / (2m)`\n    *   From `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `2*m1*T1 = 2*m2*T2`, which simplifies to `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Find the ratio of kinetic energies:\n        `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n        So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    2.  Use the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n        `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n        `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n        `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n        `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\n\nWe again use the conservation of momentum, but with the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:**\n    *   Energy-Momentum Relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c^2)^2`\n    *   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy `T` as: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m₀c^2)`.\n    *   From `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Set the momentum terms equal:\n        `T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(m1c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2*T2_rel*(m2c^2)`\n    2.  Substitute `T2_rel = Q - T1_rel = 3 - T1_rel` and the rest-mass energies (in GeV):\n        `T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2*(3 - T1_rel)*(99)`\n    3.  Expand and simplify the equation:\n        `T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = (9 - 6*T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (594 - 198*T1_rel)`\n        The `T1_rel^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `396*T1_rel = 603 - 204*T1_rel`\n    4.  Solve for `T1_rel`:\n        `396*T1_rel + 204*T1_rel = 603`\n        `600*T1_rel = 603`\n        `T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the two values for T1.\n\n*   `Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>"
