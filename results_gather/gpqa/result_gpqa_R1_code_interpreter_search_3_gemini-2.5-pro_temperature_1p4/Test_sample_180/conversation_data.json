    "This is a problem about the solar neutrino spectrum. To solve it, we need to understand which nuclear reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how their fluxes compare.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **The event:** The pp-III (proton-proton III) branch of solar fusion stops.\n    *   **Timing:** The event happened ~8.5 minutes ago, and neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light. Light takes about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun. This means the effects of this change are just becoming observable on Earth now.\n    *   **The Goal:** Calculate the approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) to the flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   **The Constraint:** All other reaction branches (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) are unaffected.\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources:** We need to know the primary sources of solar neutrinos and their energy spectra.\n    *   **pp-I Chain:** The main `p+p -> d+e+νe` reaction produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos up to 420 keV. These do not fall into our energy bands.\n    *   **pp-II Chain:** This branch includes the reaction `7Be + e- -> 7Li + νe`. This is an electron capture reaction that produces neutrinos at a discrete energy (a \"line\"). The most prominent line is at **861 keV** (with a smaller one at 384 keV). The pp-II branch is **unaffected** by the change.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:** This branch involves the beta decay `8B -> 8Be* + e+ + νe`. This produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos up to ~15 MeV. **This is the source that has stopped.** Before stopping, these `8B` neutrinos would have contributed some flux to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** The `13N` and `15O` decays produce continuous neutrino spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These reactions are **unaffected** and contribute flux to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   The `8B` neutrinos are gone.\n        *   The `pp` neutrinos are below this energy range.\n        *   The `7Be` line is outside this band.\n        *   Therefore, the *only* remaining sources of neutrinos in this band are the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle (`13N` and `15O`). The flux here is relatively low.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The `8B` neutrinos are gone.\n        *   Like Band 1, this band receives a relatively low flux from the CNO cycle's continuous spectra.\n        *   **Crucially**, this band contains the extremely intense `7Be` neutrino line at 861 keV from the pp-II chain. Since the pp-II chain is unaffected, this strong source remains.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   The flux in Band 2 is completely dominated by the `7Be` line. The contribution from the CNO cycle in this band is negligible in comparison. So, `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(7Be line)`.\n    *   The flux in Band 1 consists only of the contribution from the CNO cycle in that 100 keV window. So, `Flux(Band 1) = Flux(CNO in 700-800 keV)`.\n    *   The ratio is therefore: `Ratio ≈ Flux(CNO in 700-800 keV) / Flux(7Be line)`.\n\n5.  **Order-of-Magnitude Estimation:**\n    *   Let's use data from the Standard Solar Model.\n    *   The total flux of the `7Be` line at 861 keV is approximately **~5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**.\n    *   The *total* flux of all CNO neutrinos (`13N` + `15O`) is approximately **~5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. This total CNO flux is spread out over an energy range of more than 1.5 MeV.\n    *   Notice that the `7Be` line flux is already about 10 times larger than the *entire* CNO flux.\n    *   The flux in Band 1 (`Flux(CNO in 700-800 keV)`) is only the small fraction of the total CNO flux that falls within that 100 keV window. The CNO spectrum is spread over about 1500 keV, so a 100 keV window contains roughly 1/15th of the total CNO flux (this is a simplification, but good for an estimate).\n    *   `Flux(Band 1)` ≈ (1/15) * `Flux(CNO total)` ≈ (1/15) * 5 x 10⁸ ≈ 3.3 x 10⁷.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2)` ≈ `Flux(7Be line)` ≈ 5 x 10⁹.\n    *   Ratio ≈ (3.3 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = (3.3/5) * 10⁻² ≈ 0.66 x 10⁻².\n\n    This result, 0.0066, is very close to 0.01.\n\n    In summary, Band 1 contains a small fraction of the relatively weak CNO flux, while Band 2 contains the extremely strong `7Be` line flux. The flux in Band 2 is therefore about two orders of magnitude (a factor of 100) larger than the flux in Band 1. The ratio of Band 1 to Band 2 should thus be around 1/100 or 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State (Before the Change):**\n    The Sun produces neutrinos through several fusion reaction chains. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains (I, II, and III) and the CNO cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum (either a continuous spectrum or a discrete energy line).\n    *   **pp-I Chain:** The main `p + p → d + e⁺ + νₑ` reaction produces low-energy neutrinos (up to 420 keV). These are not in our energy bands of interest (700-900 keV).\n    *   **pp-II Chain:** The electron capture reaction `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ` produces a very prominent, monoenergetic line of neutrinos at **861 keV**. This is the key contributor to the 800-900 keV band.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:** The beta decay `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ` produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos up to about 15 MeV. These \"Boron-8\" neutrinos contribute to both the 700-800 keV band and the 800-900 keV band.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** Reactions like `¹³N` decay and `¹⁵O` decay also produce neutrinos with continuous spectra that extend into the 700-900 keV range.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Change:**\n    The problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n    *   This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases immediately.\n    *   The problem also states that **all other reactions remain as they were**. This is crucial. The pp-II chain and the CNO cycle continue to operate normally.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n    Since the neutrinos travel from the Sun to Earth in about 8.3 minutes, an event that happened 8.5 minutes ago is now observable on Earth. We need to calculate the ratio of the fluxes in the two bands *without* the `⁸B` neutrinos.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Contribution is now zero.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: The line is at 861 keV, which is *outside* this band. Contribution is zero.\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: Energy is too low. Contribution is zero.\n        *   **Remaining source:** The continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`). This is the only source of flux in this band.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Contribution is now zero.\n        *   **Remaining source 1:** The extremely strong, monoenergetic **`⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV**. This line is from the pp-II chain, which is unaffected. It falls squarely within this band.\n        *   **Remaining source 2:** The continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** also contributes some flux in this band.\n\n4.  **Compare the Fluxes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   `Flux (Band 1)` = Flux from CNO cycle in the 700-800 keV window.\n    *   `Flux (Band 2)` = Flux from the `⁷Be` line + Flux from CNO cycle in the 800-900 keV window.\n\n    Now, let's compare the magnitudes of these sources using standard solar model data:\n    *   Total `⁷Be` line flux: ~ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/(cm²·s). This is an enormous flux concentrated at a single energy.\n    *   Total CNO cycle flux (sum of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O`): ~ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/(cm²·s). This flux is spread out over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV).\n\n    The flux from the CNO cycle in any given 100 keV window (like our bands) is only a small fraction of its total flux. In contrast, the flux in Band 2 is almost entirely composed of the massive `⁷Be` line flux. The contribution from the CNO cycle in Band 2 is negligible compared to the `⁷Be` line.\n\n    Therefore, we can approximate:\n    *   `Flux (Band 1)` ≈ A small fraction of the CNO flux.\n    *   `Flux (Band 2)` ≈ The `⁷Be` line flux.\n\n    The ratio is `Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)`.\n    Numerically:\n    *   The total `⁷Be` line flux is about **10 times larger** than the *total* CNO flux.\n    *   `Flux (Band 1)` is only a small fraction of that already smaller CNO flux.\n    *   This means `Flux (Band 2)` is significantly larger than `Flux (Band 1)`, by about two orders of magnitude (a factor of ~100).\n\n    The ratio `Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)` will be approximately 1/100, or 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **The Scenario:** A hypothetical event where the pp-III branch of the Sun's fusion process stops.\n    *   **The Constraint:** All other reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue as normal.\n    *   **The Timing:** The event happened ~8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun-Earth distance is about 8.3 light-minutes, the consequences of this event are just now observable on Earth. This detail confirms we should analyze the \"new\" state of the Sun.\n    *   **The Question:** Calculate the approximate ratio of neutrino flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) to the flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   `Ratio = Flux (700-800 keV) / Flux (800-900 keV)`\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources and Their Energies:**\n    We need to know which solar reactions produce neutrinos and in what energy ranges.\n    *   **pp-I Chain:** The primary `p + p` reaction produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos up to 420 keV. These are irrelevant as they are below both our energy bands.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:** This involves the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`). It produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV). In the normal Sun, these `⁸B` neutrinos would contribute to the flux in both Band 1 and Band 2. **However, the problem states this reaction has stopped, so its contribution is now zero.**\n    *   **pp-II Chain:** This chain is crucial. It includes the electron capture reaction `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ`. This reaction does *not* produce a continuous spectrum; it produces mono-energetic (line) neutrinos. The most prominent line by far is at **861 keV**. The problem states the pp-II chain is **unaffected**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** Reactions within this cycle, primarily the decay of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O`, produce continuous neutrino spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. The CNO cycle is also **unaffected**, so it continues to contribute neutrinos in both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Remaining Flux in Each Band:**\n    With the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, we look at the remaining sources for each band.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: No (too low energy).\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: No (stopped).\n        *   `⁷Be` line neutrinos: No (the line is at 861 keV, outside this band).\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of flux in this band is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: No.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: No.\n        *   `⁷Be` line neutrinos: **Yes!** The extremely intense 861 keV line falls directly in the middle of this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux in this band comes from two sources: the CNO cycle's continuous spectrum and, most importantly, the powerful `⁷Be` line.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    The problem now boils down to comparing the CNO flux in Band 1 to the `⁷Be` + CNO flux in Band 2. To do this, we need the approximate flux magnitudes from the Standard Solar Model.\n\n    *   **`⁷Be` Line Flux:** The total flux from this single line is immense, approximately **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle Flux:** The *total* flux from the main CNO sources (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` combined) is about **5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**.\n\n    Let's compare these two sources: The `⁷Be` line flux is about **10 times larger** than the *entire* flux from the CNO cycle.\n\n    Now, let's look at our bands:\n    *   `Flux (Band 2)` is dominated by the `⁷Be` line. The CNO contribution in this 100 keV window is a small fraction of its total flux, making it negligible compared to the ~5 x 10⁹ from the `⁷Be` line. So, `Flux (Band 2) ≈ 5 x 10⁹`.\n    *   `Flux (Band 1)` is only the small fraction of the total CNO flux (~5 x 10⁸) that falls within the 700-800 keV window. The CNO flux is spread over ~1700 keV, so a 100 keV window contains roughly 1/17th of the total. Let's approximate this as a factor of 10 for simplicity. So, `Flux (Band 1)` is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the total CNO flux. `Flux (Band 1) ≈ (1/10) * 5 x 10⁸ = 5 x 10⁷`.\n\n    **Final Ratio Calculation:**\n    `Ratio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)`\n    `Ratio ≈ 10⁷ / 10⁹`\n    `Ratio ≈ 10⁻² = 0.01`\n\nThe flux in the 800-900 keV band, dominated by the `⁷Be` line, is about 100 times larger than the flux in the 700-800 keV band, which only contains a small portion of the much weaker CNO flux.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to understand the composition of the solar neutrino flux in two specific energy bands, given a hypothetical change in the Sun's fusion processes.\n    *   **Hypothetical Change:** The pp-III (proton-proton III) reaction chain stops.\n    *   **Unaffected Reactions:** The pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle reactions continue as normal.\n    *   **Timing:** The change happened ~8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun is about 8.3 light-minutes away. This means we are observing the Sun in its new state, *after* the pp-III chain has stopped.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the ratio of the flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) to the flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV). Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:** We must identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos that fall into our energy bands of interest.\n    *   **pp-I Chain (`p+p`):** Produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to a maximum of 420 keV. These are **below** both Band 1 and Band 2.\n    *   **pp-III Chain (`⁸B` decay):** This produces neutrinos with a high-energy continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. Normally, this would contribute to both bands. However, the problem states **this source has been turned OFF**. So, its contribution is zero.\n    *   **pp-II Chain (`⁷Be` capture):** This is the crucial part. This reaction produces mono-energetic neutrinos (a \"line spectrum\"), not a continuous one. The overwhelmingly dominant line is at **861 keV**. This reaction is **unaffected** by the change.\n    *   **CNO Cycle (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O` decay):** These reactions produce neutrinos with continuous spectra that extend up to 1.2 MeV and 1.7 MeV, respectively. They contribute to both energy bands and are **unaffected**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Flux in Each Band (Post-Change):**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   Contribution from `pp-I`: Zero (energy too low).\n        *   Contribution from `pp-III` (`⁸B`): Zero (turned off).\n        *   Contribution from `pp-II` (`⁷Be`): Zero (the 861 keV line is outside this band).\n        *   **Result for Band 1:** The only source of neutrinos in this band is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle**.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   Contribution from `pp-I`: Zero.\n        *   Contribution from `pp-III` (`⁸B`): Zero.\n        *   Contribution from `pp-II` (`⁷Be`): **Yes**. The very intense 861 keV line falls directly in the middle of this band.\n        *   Contribution from `CNO Cycle`: **Yes**. The continuous spectrum also contributes some flux here.\n        *   **Result for Band 2:** The flux is composed of the **`⁷Be` line AND the CNO cycle** contribution.\n\n4.  **Compare Flux Magnitudes:**\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO (in the 700-800 keV window)`\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be (861 keV line) + Flux_CNO (in the 800-900 keV window)`\n\n    Now, we need to compare the scale of these fluxes. According to the Standard Solar Model:\n    *   The total flux from the `⁷Be` line is enormous, around 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n    *   The total flux from all CNO sources combined is much smaller, around 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n\n    Notice that the flux from the **`⁷Be` line alone is about 10 times greater than the *entire* flux from the CNO cycle.**\n\n    Therefore, in Band 2, the flux from the `⁷Be` line completely dominates the small contribution from the CNO cycle. We can approximate:\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_⁷Be ≈ 5 x 10⁹`\n\n    The flux in Band 1 is only the small portion of the CNO flux that happens to fall in that 100 keV window. Since the total CNO flux (~5 x 10⁸) is already 10 times smaller than the `⁷Be` flux, this small fraction will be much smaller still. The ratio is:\n\n    `Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (a small fraction of CNO flux) / (⁷Be flux)`\n\n    Since `CNO flux ≈ 0.1 * ⁷Be flux`, the ratio is approximately:\n\n    `Ratio ≈ (a small fraction) * 0.1`\n\n    This result will be a small number, significantly less than 0.1. A factor of 100 difference is a very reasonable estimate. A ratio of 1/100 = 0.01 is the most plausible answer.\n\n    Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is dominated by the huge `⁷Be` line, while the flux in Band 1 is a small piece of the much weaker CNO flux. The flux in Band 2 is about two orders of magnitude (a factor of ~100) larger than the flux in Band 1.\n\nThe ratio Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) is approximately 1/100.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **The event:** The pp-III (proton-proton III) branch of solar fusion stops.\n    *   **The timing:** The event happened about 8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Earth is about 8.3 light-minutes from the Sun. This means the effect of the pp-III branch stopping is observable on Earth right now.\n    *   **Unaffected processes:** All other reactions, specifically the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycles, are stated to remain unchanged.\n    *   **The goal:** Calculate the approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands: Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV). The required ratio is `Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Neutrino Sources and their Energies:**\n    We need to determine which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy ranges and how the hypothetical event affects them.\n\n    *   **pp-I Chain:** The fundamental `p+p` reaction produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with energies up to 420 keV. These are well below the energy bands of interest (700-900 keV), so their contribution is zero in both bands.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:** This branch produces high-energy neutrinos from the decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`). These `⁸B` neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to ~15 MeV. In a normal Sun, they would contribute flux to both Band 1 and Band 2. However, the problem explicitly states that this branch has **stopped**. Therefore, the contribution from `⁸B` neutrinos is now zero.\n    *   **pp-II Chain:** This chain is crucial. It includes the electron capture reaction `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ`. This process produces mono-energetic neutrinos (a \"line spectrum\"). The most significant line is at **861 keV**. The problem states that the pp-II chain is **unaffected**, so this source remains active.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** The decays of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` in this cycle produce continuous spectra of neutrinos that extend up to 1.2 MeV and 1.7 MeV, respectively. These spectra pass through both Band 1 and Band 2. The CNO cycle is also **unaffected**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Composition of Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   Contribution from `pp-I`: Zero (energy too low).\n        *   Contribution from `pp-III (`⁸`B)`: Zero (reaction has stopped).\n        *   Contribution from `pp-II (`⁷`Be)`: Zero (the 861 keV line is outside this band).\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of neutrino flux in this band is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle**.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   Contribution from `pp-I`: Zero.\n        *   Contribution from `pp-III (`⁸`B)`: Zero.\n        *   Contribution from `pp-II (`⁷`Be)`: **YES**. The very strong, mono-energetic line at **861 keV** falls directly within this band.\n        *   Contribution from `CNO Cycle`: **YES**. The continuous CNO spectrum also contributes some flux in this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is the sum of the **`⁷Be` line** and the **CNO cycle** contribution.\n\n4.  **Compare the Flux Magnitudes to find the Ratio:**\n\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO (in 700-800 keV window)`\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be (861 keV line) + Flux_CNO (in 800-900 keV window)`\n\n    To estimate the ratio, we need to compare the relative strengths of the `⁷Be` flux and the `CNO` flux. Standard Solar Model data tells us:\n    *   The total flux from the `⁷Be` line is immense, roughly **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n    *   The total flux from the main CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is much smaller, roughly **5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n\n    From this, we can see that the `⁷Be` line flux is about **10 times larger** than the *entire* flux from the CNO cycle combined.\n\n    Now let's re-evaluate the bands:\n    *   The flux in **Band 2** is dominated by the huge `⁷Be` line (~5 x 10⁹). The contribution from the CNO cycle in this small 100 keV window is negligible in comparison. So, `Flux(Band 2) ≈ 5 x 10⁹`.\n    *   The flux in **Band 1** consists only of a small slice of the much weaker CNO flux. Since the total CNO flux (~5 x 10⁸) is already 10 times smaller than the `⁷Be` flux, a small slice of it will be orders of magnitude smaller.\n\n    **Calculation:**\n    The flux in Band 2 is dominated by a source (`⁷Be` line) that is ~10 times stronger than the *total* source for Band 1 (`CNO` cycle). Furthermore, Band 1 only receives a fraction of that total CNO flux. This implies that the flux in Band 2 is roughly two orders of magnitude (a factor of 100) larger than the flux in Band 1.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio `Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)` is approximately `1 / 100 = 0.01`.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa.
