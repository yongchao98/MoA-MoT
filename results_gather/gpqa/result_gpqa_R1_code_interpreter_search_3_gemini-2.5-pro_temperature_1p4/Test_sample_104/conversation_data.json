    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to equate two physical phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n    *   **Phenomenon 1 (Rotational Modulation):** A star has one clean hemisphere and one hemisphere partially covered in dark (cooler) spots. As the star rotates, we see either the bright face or the dimmer, spotted face, causing a periodic change in brightness.\n    *   **Phenomenon 2 (Exoplanet Transit):** A planet passes in front of an unspotted star, blocking a fraction of its light and causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\n    The goal is to find the radius of the planet (relative to the star's radius) that would produce a brightness dip of the same magnitude as the one caused by the spots.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux from the Star:** The amount of energy (and thus, brightness or flux) radiated by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that Flux (F) is proportional to the area (A) and the fourth power of the temperature (T).\n    *   `F ∝ A * T⁴`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we are viewing the unspotted hemisphere.\n    *   The area we see is the projected disk of the star, `A_star = π * R_star²`.\n    *   The temperature is the star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   So, `F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff⁴`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we are viewing the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere is a composite of two types of surfaces.\n    *   **Spotted Area:** The spots cover a fraction `f = 0.20` of this hemisphere. The area of the spots on the projected disk is `A_spots = f * A_star`. The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`. The flux from this part is `∝ A_spots * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   **Unspotted Area (on the spotty face):** The remaining part of this hemisphere is normal photosphere. The area is `A_unspotted = (1 - f) * A_star`. The temperature is `T_eff = 6000 K`. The flux from this part is `∝ A_unspotted * T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Total Minimum Flux:** We sum the contributions from both parts.\n        `F_min ∝ (A_unspotted * T_eff⁴) + (A_spots * T_spot⁴)`\n        `F_min ∝ ((1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴) + (f * A_star * T_spot⁴)`\n        `F_min ∝ A_star * [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Signal from Spots:** The amplitude is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   The term `A_star` (and any other constants of proportionality) will cancel out.\n    *   `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n6.  **Model the Signal from an Exoplanet Transit:** During a transit, the planet blocks a portion of the star's light. The fractional drop in brightness is simply the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n    *   `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n7.  **Equate the Two Signals and Solve:** The problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots is the same as the transit depth from the hypothetical planet.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** Now, I will plug in the given values into the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\ntemp_ratio_p4 = (T_spot / T_eff)**4\namplitude = f * (1 - temp_ratio_p4)\n\n# The transit depth for an exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spots.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrpl_rstar_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{rpl_rstar_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>0.3113\n\n9.  **Final Analysis:** The calculated value for `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3113.
