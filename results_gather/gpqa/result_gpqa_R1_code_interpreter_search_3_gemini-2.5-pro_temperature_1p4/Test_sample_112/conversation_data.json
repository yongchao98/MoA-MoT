    "*   **Analysis of the Provided Data**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. Its position is consistent with the C=O of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C double bond (alkene) stretch.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of signals for vinyl-hydrogens is definitive proof of a C=C double bond in the molecule's structure.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of information. This mass corresponds to the `[COOH]+` fragment. This fragment is formed by the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carboxyl group and is highly diagnostic for carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Putting the Clues Together**\n\nThe combination of the FTIR and Mass Spec data provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The FTIR and 1H NMR data both confirm the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Chemical Formulas**\n\nWe need to find the formula that represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid with 6 carbon atoms. Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option. The DoU indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nThe structure we've identified has:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for 1 DoU.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene), which accounts for 1 DoU.\n*   Total required DoU = 2.\n\nAdditionally, a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately rules out options A and C.\n\nLet's check the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen. Incorrect. (DoU = 6 + 1 - 10/2 = 2)\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens. Correct number of oxygens.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU matches our required value of 2 (one C=C and one C=O). This is a perfect match.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen. Incorrect. (DoU = 6 + 1 - 12/2 = 1)\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens, but its DoU is incorrect.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This DoU can only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, but not the C=C bond confirmed by NMR and FTIR. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data—an unsaturated carboxylic acid—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the reasoning process for identifying the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:** This technique identifies functional groups based on how they absorb infrared light.\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in this region (spanning ~2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is the hallmark of an O-H stretch within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. Its position is consistent with the C=O of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n        *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=C double bond stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n        *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n    *   **1H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:** This technique gives information about the hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n        *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene functional group.\n        *   **NMR Conclusion:** Confirms the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** This technique provides the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecule and its fragments.\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, `[COOH]+`:\n            *   Carbon (C) = ~12 amu\n            *   Oxygen (O) = ~16 amu\n            *   Hydrogen (H) = ~1 amu\n            *   Mass of [COOH] = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n        *   The observation of this fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n    *   The combined evidence points unequivocally to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain:\n        *   A -COOH group (which has **two oxygen atoms**).\n        *   A C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Proposed Chemical Formulas using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our identified structure has one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond, so it must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen atom. Incorrect, as a carboxylic acid requires two.\n        *   **C) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen atom. Incorrect.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** Has the correct number of oxygens for a carboxylic acid. Let's check its DoU:\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            *   This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond. It represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. Incorrect.\n        *   **B) C6H10O2:** Has the correct number of oxygens. Let's check its DoU:\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            *   This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. **This is the correct formula.** An example of such a compound is 2-hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound. Then, this structural information can be used to determine the correct molecular formula from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **alkene** functional group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify what common chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, which we suspect is present from the FTIR data.\n    *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1\n    *   Total Mass of -COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45\n*   The detection of a fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator for a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize All Evidence and Evaluate the Formulas\n\nFrom the combined spectroscopic data, we have definitively identified two key features of the unknown molecule:\n1.  It is a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH), which means its molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It is **unsaturated**, containing at least one **C=C double bond**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these two facts.\n\n*   A) C6H10O: Incorrect. Only one oxygen atom.\n*   C) C6H12O: Incorrect. Only one oxygen atom.\n\nThis leaves us with options B and D. To distinguish between them, we use the concept of **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\nThe formula is: **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)**\n\nOur identified structure has one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This formula represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical formula **C6H10O2** is the only one that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most telling feature. A very broad absorption centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond. Its specific location is consistent with the C=O of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption indicates the presence of a C=C double bond, meaning the molecule is an **alkene**.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their confirmed presence in the NMR spectrum provides definitive proof of the **alkene** functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key fragment. We calculate its composition:\n    *   Mass of Carbon = 12 amu\n    *   Mass of Oxygen = 16 amu\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen = 1 amu\n    *   The fragment `[COOH]+` has a mass of 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence:**\n*   All three techniques point to the same conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   This means the molecule must contain:\n    *   **Two oxygen atoms** (from the -COOH group).\n    *   A C=C double bond in addition to the C=O double bond.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Chemical Formulas:**\n*   First, we can eliminate any formula that does not have two oxygen atoms. This rules out **A) C6H10O** and **C) C6H12O**.\n*   We are left with B) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2. To differentiate them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, which tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   `DoU = C + 1 - (H / 2)`\n*   Our molecule has one C=O pi bond and one C=C pi bond, so it requires a **DoU of 2**.\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid and contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond. So, it is incorrect.\n\n*   **For B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our required structure (one C=O bond + one C=C bond). This is the correct formula.\n\n<<<B>>>",
