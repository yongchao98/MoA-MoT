    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The correct approach is to determine the moles of each species, allow them to react, and then calculate the pH based on the final composition of the solution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n*   **Volume:**\n    *   CH3COOH: 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   HCl: 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Ba(OH)2: 300 mL = 0.300 L\n*   **Moles:**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of HCl (strong acid) = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 mol of H+ ions.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base) = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates to yield two OH- ions per formula unit. Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the neutralization reactions:**\nThe reactions will occur in steps. The strongest acid and strongest base will react first.\n\n*   **Step A: Reaction between strong acid (H+ from HCl) and strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n    *   Since there is more OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n*   **Step B: Reaction between the remaining strong base (OH-) and the weak acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining from Step A = 0.10 mol\n    *   Again, the base is in excess. All the weak acid will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH3COO- (acetate) formed = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- remaining = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\nThe final solution contains 0.05 mol of excess OH- (a strong base) and 0.05 mol of CH3COO- (a weak base) in a total volume.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n*   The pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base (OH-), as its contribution will be much greater than the OH- produced by the hydrolysis of the weak acetate ion.\n*   **Concentration of excess OH-**:\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_ba_oh2 = 0.3 * 0.300\n\n# Moles of H+ and OH- from strong electrolytes\nmoles_h_plus_strong = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_minus_strong = 2 * moles_ba_oh2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization reactions\n# Strong acid vs Strong base\noh_minus_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_minus_strong - moles_h_plus_strong\n\n# Remaining strong base vs Weak acid\noh_minus_excess = oh_minus_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: Calculate pH\n# Total volume\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300  # in Liters\n\n# Concentration of excess OH-\nconc_oh_excess = oh_minus_excess / total_volume\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n12.62\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.
