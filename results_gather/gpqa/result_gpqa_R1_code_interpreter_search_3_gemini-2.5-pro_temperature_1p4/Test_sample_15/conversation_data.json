    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in the same plane. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry within the molecule (the molecular plane itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The important part of the name for this analysis is the stereochemical descriptor `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The `(3aR,7aS)` notation indicates that the molecule has at least two chiral centers with a specific, defined absolute configuration. This means we are considering a single, specific stereoisomer. The complex and unsymmetrical nature of the molecule, including the `(E)-chloromethylene` group, makes it highly improbable that the molecule possesses any internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or center of inversion) that would render it achiral. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and specified as a single stereoisomer, therefore optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric in its connectivity, with two identical halves (`-CH(CH3)COOH`). When the two chiral centers have opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is possible for the molecule to be a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. If we draw the Fischer projection for the (2R, 3S) isomer, we can see a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (2R)\n        ------- (plane of symmetry)\n      CH3 ---|--- H    (3S)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   Because it possesses a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso compound) and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the compound above.\n    *   **Analysis:** This isomer has the (R,R) configuration. Its mirror image would be the (S,S) isomer. The (R,R) and (S,S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and specified as a single enantiomer, therefore optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and specified as a single enantiomer, therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Analysis:** The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` or the equivalent `cis,cis,cis` or simply `all-cis` refers to the diastereomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing \"up\"). This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral elements.\n        *   **Chiral centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The `CH` in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the carbonyl group (C=O), the adjacent CH2, the CH, and the bond between the two methyl groups. This plane bisects the cyclopentyl ring. The presence of this plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   Optically **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Optically Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   Optically **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   Optically **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Optically Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and are present as a single enantiomer (or a non-racemic mixture).

This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer. The complex, bridged bicyclic structure is inherently asymmetric. The presence of specified chiral centers (`3aR`, `7aS`) in such a structure, which lacks any obvious symmetry, confirms that the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a specific chiral stereoisomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The molecule's connectivity is symmetrical around the C2-C3 bond. The stereochemical descriptors are opposite (`R` and `S`). This combination creates a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry that lies between the two chiral carbons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3, with the same configuration (`R` and `R`). This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and the two are not superimposable. Therefore, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral.

This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C₃) and, more importantly, three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ).

The carbon atom in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.

    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must analyze each one to see if it is chiral. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and exists as a single enantiomer or a non-racemic mixture. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image.

The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` indicate that this is a single, specific stereoisomer of a complex molecule. The presence of defined chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a) in an asymmetric, rigid bicyclic structure ensures the molecule is chiral.
