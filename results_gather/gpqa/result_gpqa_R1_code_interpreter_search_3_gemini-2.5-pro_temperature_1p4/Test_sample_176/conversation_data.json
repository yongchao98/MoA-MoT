    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), i.e., the factor L1 / L2.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the formula:\n        L = 4πR²σT⁴\n        where R is the star's radius, T is its effective surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the effective surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which its emission spectrum peaks (i.e., where it appears brightest). The formula is:\n        λ_max = b / T\n        where b is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the luminosity ratio:**\n    To find the factor by which L1 is greater than L2, we calculate the ratio L1 / L2.\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\n    The constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁² / R₂²) * (T₁⁴ / T₂⁴)\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the given information about radii:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n5.  **Use the given information about peak wavelength to find the temperature ratio:**\n    The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. This means their peak wavelengths (λ_max) are equal.\n    λ_max,1 = λ_max,2\n\n    According to Wien's Law (λ_max = b/T), if the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must also be the same.\n    b / T₁ = b / T₂\n    T₁ = T₂\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1\n\n6.  **Analyze the other given information (mass and radial velocity):**\n    *   **Mass (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂):** This information is not required for calculating luminosity using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which depends on radius and temperature. It is extraneous information.\n    *   **Radial Velocity (v₁ = 0 km/s, v₂ = 700 km/s):** This information relates to the Doppler shift of the starlight. When astronomers \"determine\" an intrinsic property of a star like its peak emission wavelength (to find its temperature), they first correct for the Doppler shift caused by its motion. Therefore, the statement \"determined the wavelengths ... and found that they are the same\" implies that the rest-frame wavelengths are the same, which correctly leads to the conclusion that T₁ = T₂. The velocity information is a distractor, intended to test whether one understands which physical quantities are relevant.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final luminosity ratio:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nTo be certain, we can perform the calculation using a simple python script.\n```python\n# Given ratio of radii\nR1_div_R2 = 1.5\n\n# As per Wien's Law, same peak wavelength implies same temperature.\n# So the ratio of temperatures is 1.\nT1_div_T2 = 1.0\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_div_R2)**2 * (T1_div_T2)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\n2.25\n\nThe calculation confirms that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2). The problem provides information about the stars' radii, masses, peak emission wavelengths, and radial velocities. It also specifies that the stars should be treated as black bodies.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The formula is:\n    *   `L = σ * A * T⁴`\n    *   Where `L` is luminosity, `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `A` is the surface area of the star, and `T` is the effective surface temperature.\n    *   For a spherical star, the surface area `A = 4 * π * R²`, where `R` is the radius.\n    *   Substituting the area, the formula becomes: `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to find the factor by which L1 is greater than L2, which is the ratio L1 / L2.\n    *   `L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴`\n    *   `L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴`\n    *   The ratio is: `L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)`\n    *   The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n        `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information to find the Ratios:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio (R1/R2):** The problem states, \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\" This means `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):** The problem doesn't give the temperatures directly. However, it states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This relates to Wien's Displacement Law:\n        *   `λ_max = b / T`, where `λ_max` is the peak wavelength and `b` is Wien's constant.\n        *   If `λ_max` for Star_1 is equal to `λ_max` for Star_2, then:\n            `b / T1 = b / T2`\n        *   This implies `T1 = T2`, which means the temperature ratio `T1 / T2 = 1`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Extraneous Information:**\n    *   **Mass:** The mass information (`M1 = 1.5 * M2`) is not needed for the Stefan-Boltzmann Law calculation, which depends only on radius and temperature. It is extra information intended to see if I will try to use a mass-luminosity relation, which is not the correct approach here given the other information.\n    *   **Radial Velocity:** The radial velocities (0 km/s and 700 km/s) would cause a Doppler shift in the observed light. However, when astronomers determine intrinsic properties like a star's temperature from its spectrum, they correct for this shift. The statement \"determined the wavelengths... and found that they are the same\" implies they are comparing the intrinsic, rest-frame wavelengths. Therefore, this information is also a distractor.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now I can substitute the derived ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula.\n    *   `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n    *   `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴`\n    *   `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1`\n    *   `L1 / L2 = 2.25`\n\n7.  **Final Confirmation:** The result is exactly 2.25. This matches option B. I can use a quick python script to double-check the simple arithmetic.\n```python\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2 is given.\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n\n# Wien's Displacement Law states that peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature (lambda_max = b/T).\n# Since the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same.\n# Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is 1.\nT1_over_T2 = 1.0\n\n# The ratio of luminosities is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L is proportional to R^2 * T^4.\n# So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe code confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>",
