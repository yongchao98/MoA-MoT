    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%), is crucial. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This 3:1 ratio is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes exist in a natural abundance of roughly 75% and 25%, respectively).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, ³⁵Cl=35):\nThe molecular formula for all four options is C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\nAll options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H bond stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal falls in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Carboxylic acid. (Possible)\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Aldehyde and phenol, not a carboxylic acid. (Eliminated)\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Carboxylic acid. (Possible)\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester. Lacks the O-H group and the C=O stretch would be at a higher frequency. (Eliminated)\n\nWe are now left with options A and C.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The signal is a singlet ('s') because this proton does not typically couple with other protons, and the integration ('1H') confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** We have two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet representing two equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet representing two other equivalent protons.\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the protons on the other.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on the NMR splitting pattern:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (*ortho*) ring. All four aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (*para*) ring. It has a plane of symmetry. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are also equivalent. This symmetry leads to the observed pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields its neighboring protons more than the chlorine atom does, so the downfield signal at 8.02 ppm corresponds to the protons next to the -COOH group, and the 7.72 ppm signal corresponds to the protons next to the -Cl.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAll pieces of evidence point to the same structure. The MS data confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum specifically identify a para-substitution pattern. Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope (M+2) Peak:** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion, is a key clue. The relative intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak (at 156) to the M+2 peak (at 158) is 100% to 32%, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion:** This 3:1 isotopic pattern is the characteristic signature of a molecule containing a single **chlorine** atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   Let's verify the molecular weight of the proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n    *   MW = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are consistent with this molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness results from extensive hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region and is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid - (Possible)\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde - (Eliminated, it's an aldehyde and a phenol)\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid - (Possible)\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate - (Eliminated, it's an acid chloride/ester, lacks the O-H group)\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nWe are now left to decide between 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum is the deciding factor.\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive proof of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms our conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region signals (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets ('d'), and each integrates to two protons ('2H').\n    *   This simple pattern (two signals for four protons) indicates a high degree of symmetry. This is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) molecule. It lacks symmetry, and all four aromatic protons would be chemically different. This would result in a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals (multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) molecule. Due to symmetry, the two protons next to the -COOH group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the -Cl group are equivalent. This leads to exactly two signals in the aromatic region. The two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets, each representing two protons. This perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence:\n*   **MS** shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, shows a para-disubstitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of each piece of spectroscopic data to elucidate the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the molecule with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. The ratio of the M⁺ to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is a characteristic 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weight of the options (all have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 156 g/mol. All options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that signifies the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate the options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Is a carboxylic acid. (Possible)\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. (Eliminated)\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Is a carboxylic acid. (Possible)\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate: Is an acid chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride type), not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group. (Eliminated)\nWe are now left with options A and C.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\nThis spectrum will differentiate between the 2-chloro (ortho) and 4-chloro (para) isomers.\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its appearance as a singlet (s) is typical. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to solving the problem.\n    *   We see two signals, both of which are doublets (d).\n    *   Each doublet integrates to two protons (2H).\n    *   This simple \"two doublets, each for 2H\" pattern is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule means there are only two types of aromatic protons. The protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent. These two sets of protons are adjacent to each other, so they split each other into doublets.\n*   **Comparing remaining options:**\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It is unsymmetrical, and all four aromatic protons are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It possesses the necessary symmetry to produce a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, perfectly matching the provided NMR data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAll three spectroscopic techniques point to the same structure. The MS shows a chlorine-containing compound with MW=156. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum are only consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. Therefore, the unknown compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in chemical structure elucidation, where we use data from multiple spectroscopic techniques to piece together the structure of an unknown molecule. Let's analyze each piece of evidence step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent elements.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at **m/z = 158** (two mass units heavier than the M⁺ peak) has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%).
