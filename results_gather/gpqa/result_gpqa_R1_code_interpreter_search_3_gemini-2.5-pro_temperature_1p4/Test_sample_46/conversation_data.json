    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency. The formula is:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n        Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n    *   For C9H11NO2:\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is typical for an ester. It is too high for an amide (typically 1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and within the range for ketones and aldehydes, but an ester is a strong possibility given the other data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet signal integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet signal integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the characteristic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃) or an ether.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the labile protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, are highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely ortho to an electron-donating group (like the -NH₂ group).\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the carbonyl of an ester).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From our analysis, we have the following fragments: a primary amine (-NH₂), an ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃), a carbonyl group (C=O), and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Assembling these fragments leads to a structure with a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with an -NH₂ group and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the proposed options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has all the required features: a primary amine (-NH₂), an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), and a para-disubstituted ring. It matches all the spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (two N-H bands). The carbonyl stretch would be at a lower frequency. It also lacks the correct NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (-CONH₂) and is meta-substituted. While the IR might show two N-H bands, the carbonyl frequency is likely lower, and the NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern than two doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this structure, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is definitive for a -CH₂- group attached to an oxygen.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the spectroscopic data are consistent only with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. A secondary amine would show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group stretch**. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical amide (which usually appears around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the characteristic pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The methylene (-CH₂-) protons are split into a quartet by the adjacent methyl (-CH₃) protons, and the methyl protons are split into a triplet by the adjacent methylene protons. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, which is consistent with an ester structure: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadening is due to chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar moment. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The ring has two substituents: one electron-donating and one electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH₂) shields the adjacent protons, causing them to appear more upfield (at 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOR) deshields the adjacent protons, causing them to appear more downfield (at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Fragments and Evaluate the Options\nBased on the analysis, the compound contains:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all our findings: a para-substituted ring with an -NH₂ group and an ethyl ester group.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (should have one N-H peak) and the NMR. The C=O stretch would also be at a lower frequency.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (amide C=O is at the wrong frequency) and is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this ester, the ethyl group is part of the acyl portion (-COCH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) signal would appear around 2.5 ppm (next to a C=O), not at 4.5 ppm (next to an O).\n\nTherefore, the only structure that is consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically interpreting each piece of spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 π bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a definitive characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (usually < 1690 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an **ester group (C=O)** that is conjugated with the benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group as part of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the labile protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The signal is broad due to chemical exchange and coupling to nitrogen. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is the classic splitting pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the protons ortho (adjacent) to it, causing them to appear at a higher field (upfield, 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the protons ortho to it, causing them to appear at a lower field (downfield, 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the pieces of evidence:\n*   We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's verify this structure with the given options.\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring. The formula is C9H11NO2. This matches all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex NMR aromatic pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Here, the ethyl group would be part of the acyl chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>",
