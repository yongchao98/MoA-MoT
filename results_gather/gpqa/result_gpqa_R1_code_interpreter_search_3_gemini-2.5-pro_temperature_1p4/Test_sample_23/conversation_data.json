    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\nZ is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, or 0.1428.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nH% = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of molecule) = (y * Atomic Mass of H) / (x * Atomic Mass of C + y * Atomic Mass of H)\n\nUsing approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we can test general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n*   For alkanes (CnH2n+2): H% = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n=6 (hexane), H% = 14/86 ≈ 16.3%. This is not a match.\n*   For alkenes/cycloalkanes (CnH2n): H% = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.2857%. This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is exactly 14.28%.\n\nThis excellent match strongly indicates that Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The condition that \"Z does not react further with hydrogen\" confirms that it is a saturated compound, fitting the description of a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction and the compounds in mixture Y.**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. This points to a specific type of reaction known as catalytic hydrogen transfer or Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. In this reaction, unsaturated cyclic compounds are converted into a mixture of the corresponding aromatic compound (by losing hydrogen - oxidation) and the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (by gaining hydrogen - reduction).\n\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which is characteristic of aromatic compounds and saturated alkanes/cycloalkanes. We also know that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Since Z is the saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), the other component of Y must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n\nLet's assume the simplest possible carbon skeleton for this type of reaction, which is a six-membered ring (n=6).\n*   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the formula CnH2n for n=6 and is widely used as a solvent, as stated in the problem.\n*   The corresponding aromatic compound is **Benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}**.\n*   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, fitting the description.\n\nWe must also check if the hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of Benzene (C6H6) gives Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of Cyclohexane (C6H12) results in no reaction, as it is already saturated.\n*   Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Cyclohexane (Z). This is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the compounds in mixture X and calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that disproportionates to form the equimolar mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}. Let the two liquids in mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the atoms on the reactant side must equal the atoms on the product side.\n*   **Carbon atoms:** Since the products are both C6 compounds, A and B must also be C6 compounds.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total in the products.\n    Total H atoms = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane\n    Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\nThis means the two molecules in mixture X have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo be consistent, the compounds A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons that can undergo this reaction. They have an average of 9 hydrogens each. The most logical candidates are:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n*   **A Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**\n\nLet's check the reaction:\nC6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\nThe diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogens. The alkene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining these 2 hydrogens. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction that produces an equimolar mixture, perfectly matching the problem's description.\n\nThe problem also states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n*   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n*   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies the non-conjugated one, so A is **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Both of these compounds will decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both C6H8 and C6H10 will produce only cyclohexane (C6H12), which is Z. All conditions are met.\n\n**Step 4: Final calculation.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is given by the formula: `H% = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we have `H% = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   The given percentage, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x` or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula for n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated (like cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). The cyclohexane component of Y will not react with hydrogen. Therefore, the other component of Y must be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Since this other component does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound. The only aromatic compound with a 6-carbon ring that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction from mixture X to mixture Y.**\n    *   The problem states that an equimolar mixture X of two liquids (let's call them A and B) reacts to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids (benzene and cyclohexane).\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation, which in this context (heating with a platinum catalyst) points to a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`\n    *   Because the products are C6 compounds, the reactants A and B must also be C6 compounds, likely based on a six-membered ring.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n    *   Let's focus on the hydrogen atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of benzene and one molecule of cyclohexane).\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Benzene) + (H atoms in Cyclohexane)\n    *   Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the consistency of the solution.**\n    *   The problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components (A and B) are unsaturated. They also hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane. The most plausible candidates are a cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Let A = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and B = Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Check hydrogen sum: 8 + 10 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Check the reaction: `C6H8 + C6H10 --> C6H6 + C6H12`. In this reaction, the diene (C6H8) loses two hydrogens to become benzene, and the cyclohexene (C6H10) gains those two hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer producing an equimolar product mixture.\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated double bonds in mixture X. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there exists a non-conjugated isomer: cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   Thus, a mixture of cyclohexa-1,4-diene and cyclohexene fits all conditions of the problem for mixture X. This confirms our reasoning.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we calculated to be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % of H = (y × Atomic Mass of H) / (x × Atomic Mass of C + y × Atomic Mass of H)\n\nUsing integer atomic masses for simplicity (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), the formula becomes:\n0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). We can assume this is the intended ratio.\ny / (12x + y) = 1/7\n7y = 12x + y\n6y = 12x\ny = 2x\n\nThis means the general formula for the hydrocarbon Z is CnH2n. The problem also states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. Let's check if cyclohexane, C6H12, fits the data. For C6H12, n=6, and the formula is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is:\nMass % of H = 12 / (6×12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\nThis matches perfectly. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We already know one component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which is true for saturated compounds like cyclohexane. The other component must also not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of the cyclohexane component of Y yields no reaction, as it's already saturated.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y must be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\nAn aromatic compound would fit this description, as they do not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions. The only aromatic C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\nThus, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y and find the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y (benzene and cyclohexane).\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n\nThis reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to become benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to become cyclohexane.\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene and one molecule of cyclohexane.\n\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = (H atoms in benzene) + (H atoms in cyclohexane)\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = 6 + 12\nTotal H atoms in mixture X = 18\n\n**Verification:**\nMixture X must contain two C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons that, when hydrogenated, give only cyclohexane. They must not have conjugated double bonds. A plausible combination is cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n*   Reaction: C6H8 + C6H10 --> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the alkene gains 2H to become cyclohexane, producing an equimolar mixture.\n*   Both are unsaturated (will decolorize bromine water).\n*   Neither has conjugated bonds (cyclohexa-1,4-diene has isolated double bonds).\n*   Both hydrogenate to C6H12.\nAll conditions are met.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.
