    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group).\n*   A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   These methylene groups are the alpha-carbons, and they each have **two alpha-hydrogens**.\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from aromaticity makes this tautomerization very favorable.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   The most common feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to **four different groups**, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will therefore exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and a center of inversion. More simply, the molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are **achiral**.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires us to analyze the chemical properties of four different organic compounds to determine which ones fit the given criteria.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds and are not attached to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are -CH₂- groups. These carbons are alpha to the carbonyl groups and each has **two alpha-hydrogens**. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus highly stable compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (carbon-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since it is bonded to four different groups, this carbon is a **chiral center**. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) group on each of the double-bonded carbons. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
