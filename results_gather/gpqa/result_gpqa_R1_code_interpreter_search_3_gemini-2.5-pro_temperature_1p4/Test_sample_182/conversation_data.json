    "This problem requires us to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product of a specific chemical reaction. Let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is attached at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens on the ring:\n        *   C1 (bonded to COOH, C2, C6): 1 H\n        *   C2 (bonded to CHO, C1, C3): 1 H\n        *   C3 (double-bonded to C4): 1 H\n        *   C4 (double-bonded to C3): 1 H\n        *   C5 (bonded to vinyl, C4, C6): 1 H\n        *   C6 (bonded to C1, C5): 2 H\n        *   Ring Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7 H.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens on the substituents:\n        *   -COOH: 1 H\n        *   -CHO: 1 H\n        *   -CH=CH₂: 3 H\n        *   Substituent Hydrogens = 1+1+3 = 5 H.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the reactant to check our work.\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the vinyl group) + 1 (for the C=O in the carboxylic acid) + 1 (for the C=O in the formyl group) = 5. This confirms the structure and formula.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction and identify the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P / HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon forms.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Formyl group/aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkene (C=C)** bonds are reduced to alkane (C-C) bonds. The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and the double bond in the cyclohexene ring is also saturated.\n\nThe reaction will not break the carbon ring. Therefore, the product will have the same carbon skeleton as the reactant but will be fully saturated.\n*   The **cyclohexene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The **-COOH** at C1 becomes **-CH₃**.\n*   The **-CHO** at C2 becomes **-CH₃**.\n*   The **-CH=CH₂** at C5 becomes **-CH₂CH₃** (an ethyl group).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. All double bonds have been removed, and all oxygen atoms have been eliminated.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe product retains all 10 carbon atoms from the reactant (C₁₀). Since it is a saturated monocyclic alkane, it will fit the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\nFor n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated in two ways:\n\n1.  **From the structure:** IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product (a substituted cyclohexane) = 1.\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product (it's fully saturated) = 0.\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n2.  **From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀):** The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n    For C₁₀H₂₀:\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n```python\n# The final product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n# A saturated hydrocarbon with one ring has the general formula C_n H_{2n}.\n# The number of carbon atoms from the reactant is 10.\n# So the product has the formula C10H20.\n# Let's calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for C10H20.\n# IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n# In our case, C=10, H=20, N=0.\nC = 10\nH = 20\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
