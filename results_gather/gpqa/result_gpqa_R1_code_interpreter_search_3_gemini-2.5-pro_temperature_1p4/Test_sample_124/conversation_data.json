    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential energy is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means that the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n2.  **Separate the Schrödinger Equation:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator equations, one for each Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z).\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial q_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $q_i = x, y, z$.\n\n3.  **Recall the 1D Harmonic Oscillator Energy:** The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Energy of the 3D System:** The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n5.  **Define the Principal Quantum Number and Energy Levels:** Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The possible values for $n$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, ...$ since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n    The energy levels of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n6.  **Identify the Third Excited State:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. The minimum $n$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). The energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. We need to find the number of ways to choose three non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n=3$.\n    This is a combinatorial problem. The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$. Plugging this into the formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level is 10.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The third excited state has an energy of $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10.

Understanding the System**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$. This shows that the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is equivalent to three independent 1D harmonic oscillators, one for each coordinate axis, with the same angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\n**2. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the 3D system, the total energy E is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$). The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**3. Identifying the Third Excited State**\n\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to the minimum value of $n$. The minimum value is $n=0$ (when $n_x = n_y = n_z = 0$).\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level up, corresponding to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (i.e., different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$) that have the same energy.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?\n\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
