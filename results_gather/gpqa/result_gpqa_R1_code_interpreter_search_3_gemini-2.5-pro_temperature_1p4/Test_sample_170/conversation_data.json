    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), specifically bromination. The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Activating groups speed up the reaction, while deactivating groups slow it down.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Activating groups** (like alkyl groups -CH3, -C2H5) are **ortho, para-directors**.\n    *   **Deactivating groups** (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5) are **meta-directors**.\n    *   **Halogens** (like -Cl) are an exception: they are **deactivating** but are **ortho, para-directors**.\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the **para-isomer**.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's analyze each substance:\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating group and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating group but is an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating group and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\nWe can separate the substances into two main categories:\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will produce very little para-isomer. The main product will be meta. The substances are 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These will produce significant amounts of ortho and para isomers. The substances are 1, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the para yield for any substance in the first group (2, 4, 6) will be much lower than for any substance in the second group (1, 3, 5). The final ordering will look like: (group of 2, 4, 6) < (group of 1, 3, 5).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The amount of para-product is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position. We need to compare the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivating group and the strongest meta-director. It will produce the *least* amount of para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is the next strongest.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is the weakest deactivator among the three.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is:\n4 < 6 < 2\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends mainly on steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\nLet's compare the substituents: -CH3, -C2H5, and -Cl.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The steric bulk (size) of the groups increases in the order -CH3 < -C2H5. A larger alkyl group causes more hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring the para position more. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher percentage of para-product than toluene (1).\n    *   Typical para yield for bromination of Toluene (-CH3) is ~67%.\n    *   The para yield for Ethylbenzene (-C2H5) will be higher than 67%.\n\n*   **Halogens (-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. Due to their strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect), they deactivate the ring, especially at the ortho position. Combined with steric hindrance, this results in a very high preference for the para position.\n    *   Typical para yield for bromination of Chlorobenzene (-Cl) is very high, around 88%.\n\nSo, comparing the typical para-isomer yields:\nYield(-CH3) < Yield(-C2H5) < Yield(-Cl)\n(~67%)   <   (>67%)    <   (~88%)\n\nThis gives the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group:\n1 < 5 < 3\n\n**5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors produce far less para-isomer than the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\nThe problem involves electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), specifically bromination. The key factors influencing the outcome are the properties of the substituent already on the benzene ring (`C6H5-`):\n\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents direct the incoming electrophile (`Br+`) to specific positions.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the bromination to the positions adjacent (ortho) and opposite (para) to them. They include alkyl groups (`-CH3`, `-C2H5`) and halogens (`-Cl`).\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the bromination to the meta positions. They are typically electron-withdrawing groups containing multiple bonds to electronegative atoms, such as `-NO2`, `-COOH`, and `-COOC2H5`.\n\n2.  **Para-Isomer Yield:**\n    *   For **meta-directors**, the para-isomer is a very minor byproduct. The stronger the meta-directing effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   For **ortho, para-directors**, the para-isomer is a major product. The ratio of para to ortho product depends largely on **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible and thus increasing the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, let's classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Substances 1 (C6H5-CH3) and 5 (C6H5-C2H5):** The `-CH3` (methyl) and `-C2H5` (ethyl) groups are alkyl groups. They are **ortho, para-directors**.\n*   **Substance 3 (C6H5-Cl):** The `-Cl` (chloro) group is a halogen. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Substances 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), 4 (C6H5-NO2), and 6 (C6H5-COOH):** The `-COOC2H5` (ethyl ester), `-NO2` (nitro), and `-COOH` (carboxylic acid) groups are all **meta-directors**.\n\nThis allows us to form two distinct groups. The meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors will produce a significantly higher yield. Therefore, the final ordered list will have all the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nOrder: `{Group of 2, 4, 6} < {Group of 1, 3, 5}`\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of their deactivating/meta-directing effect. We need to compare the deactivating strength of `-NO2`, `-COOH`, and `-COOC2H5`.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n`−NO2` > `−COOH` > `−COOC2H5`\n\n*   **Substance 4 (`-NO2`)** has the strongest deactivating group. It is the most powerful meta-director and will produce the **least** amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Substance 6 (`-COOH`)** is the next strongest deactivator.\n*   **Substance 2 (`-COOC2H5`)** is the weakest deactivator of the three, meaning it will allow for a slightly higher (though still very small) yield of the para-isomer compared to the others in this group.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) in substance 5 is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`) in substance 1. The larger ethyl group creates more steric hindrance at the adjacent ortho positions, which makes the remote para position more favorable for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: `1 < 5`\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyls with Halogen (1, 5 vs. 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is a special case. While it is an ortho, para-director, its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect significantly deactivates the ring, especially at the ortho positions. This electronic effect, combined with steric factors, leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. Typically, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 88% para-isomer, which is higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups according to the initial separation.\n\n1.  Start with the ordered meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n2.  Follow with the ordered ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Principles**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), where an electrophile (in this case, derived from `Br2`, so `Br+`) attacks the electron-rich benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring plays a crucial role in determining two key aspects:\n\n*   **Directing Effect:** This determines which positions (ortho, meta, or para) the incoming `Br` will attach to. Substituents are either **ortho, para-directors** or **meta-directors**.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The physical size of the substituent can block the positions adjacent to it (the ortho positions), making the position opposite to it (the para position) more accessible.\n\nOur goal is to arrange the substances by the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents and Create Groups**\n\nThe most significant factor determining para-isomer yield is the directing effect. Meta-directors produce almost no para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors produce a substantial amount.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Very low para-yield)**\n    *   These groups strongly withdraw electrons from the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. The para position is highly disfavored.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2:** `-NO2` is a powerful deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** `-COOH` is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** `-COOC2H5` is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High para-yield)**\n    *   These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3:** `-CH3` is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5:** `-C2H5` is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** `-Cl` is deactivating but is an ortho, para-director.\n\nThis classification immediately tells us that any substance from Group 1 will have a lower para-yield than any substance from Group 2. The final order will be: `{Group 1} < {Group 2}`.\n\n### **3. Rank Substances Within Group 1 (Meta-Directors)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the tiny amount of para-isomer formed is inversely proportional to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs meta. A stronger meta-director will produce even less para-product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n\n*   **Substance 4 (-NO2)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the **least** amount of para-isomer.\n*   **Substance 6 (-COOH)** is the next strongest deactivator.\n*   **Substance 2 (-COOC2H5)** is the weakest deactivator in this group, so it will produce the most para-isomer (although still a very small amount).\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **4. Rank Substances Within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors)**\n\nFor these substances, we are comparing the ratio of para to ortho product. The primary factor here is steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent blocks the ortho positions, favoring attack at the less hindered para position.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is larger than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased steric bulk hinders the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is a special case. It is strongly electron-withdrawing by induction, which deactivates the ortho positions significantly. This electronic effect, combined with its size, results in a very high selectivity for the para position (the para-isomer often accounts for ~88% of the ortho/para mixture). This selectivity is generally greater than for alkylbenzenes.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **5. Assemble the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the rankings of the two groups, we get the final sequence.\n\n*   Start with the meta-directors, from lowest to highest para-yield: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Continue with the ortho, para-directors, from lowest to highest para-yield: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
