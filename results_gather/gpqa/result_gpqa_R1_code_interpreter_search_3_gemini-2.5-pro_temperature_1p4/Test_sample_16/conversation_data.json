    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or KCa-EDTA) for the complex, which is $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. This 'x' will also be the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The dissociation constant ($K_d = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$) is very small. This indicates that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from a solution initially containing the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the relevant equilibrium.**\n    The problem provides a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will dissociate slightly into its constituent ions, Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the formation constant (K_f) to the dissociation constant (K_d).**\n    The problem gives the formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ (also known as $K_f$), which corresponds to the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no free calcium or EDTA ions are initially present.

    "This problem requires us to determine the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) at equilibrium in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$.
