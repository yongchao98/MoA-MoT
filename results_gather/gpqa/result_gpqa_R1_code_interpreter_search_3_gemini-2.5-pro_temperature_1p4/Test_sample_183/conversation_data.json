    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and analyze the relationship between the substituents.\n- The parent ring is benzene.\n- At C1, there is an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n- At C2, there is a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu).\n- At C3, there is a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThe substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n- **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n- **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, so it often favors para-substitution over ortho.\n- **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe final structure has two ortho,para-directors (-OEt, -tBu) ortho to each other, and one of them (-OEt) is meta to a meta-director (-NO2). Synthesizing this specific arrangement is non-trivial and often requires careful strategic planning, such as using blocking groups or exploiting less common directing effects.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to see if it can lead to the desired product in high yield. We must consider the major products of each reaction.\n\n**Option A)** `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\nThis sequence is flawed from the beginning. Step (iv) is the diazotization of an amine (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the intermediate from step (iii) (a substituted benzenesulfonic acid) does not have an amino group. This option is chemically incorrect as written.\n\n**Option B)** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   **i) HNO3/H2SO4 on benzene:** -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   **ii) Fe/HCl on nitrobenzene:** -> Aniline.\n*   **iii) tBuCl/AlCl3 on aniline (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. So, this step would produce m-tert-butylaniline. Alternatively, under different conditions, it might give p-tert-butylaniline, but yields are typically low.\n*   Let's assume the reaction proceeds, and for the sake of finding a path to the target, we consider the minor *ortho* product: **o-tert-butylaniline**. A high-yield synthesis wouldn't rely on a minor product, but let's explore this path as it's the only one that can place the tBu group at the C2 position relative to a nitrogen-based group at C1.\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on o-tert-butylaniline:** This is nitration in strong acid. The amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). We have -NH3+ at C1 and -tBu at C2.\n    *   The -NH3+ group is a *meta*-director (directs to C3 and C5).\n    *   The -tBu group is an *ortho,para*-director (directs to C4 and C6).\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. The reaction would likely yield a mixture of products with low yield, making it unsuitable for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. However, among the possible positions, only substitution at C3 would lead to the required 1,2,3 pattern. Let's hypothetically assume that some of the required **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** is formed.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline. This creates a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** (Let's assume the steps are reordered logically, as hydrolysis must follow diazotization). This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** (Williamson Ether Synthesis). This converts the phenol (-OH) to an ethoxy ether (-OEt). This yields the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **What about steps vi) SO3/H2SO4 and vii) dilute H2SO4?** These are sulfonation and desulfonation steps. Their placement in the middle of the sequence as written in the option is illogical. They might be typos or indicate a more complex, unstated purpose.\n\nDespite the low-yield and questionable steps (alkylation of aniline, nitration with conflicting directors) and the jumbled order, this is the only sequence that contains a potential (though flawed) pathway to the correct 1,2,3-substituted isomer.\n\n**Option C)** `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   i) -> tert-butylbenzene\n*   ii) -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para is the major product, blocking the C4 position).\n*   iii) Nitration. The -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) both direct to C2. -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nThis sequence locks the substituents into a 1,2,4-pattern, which cannot lead to the 1,2,3-target molecule.\n\n**Option D)** `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   i) -> tert-butylbenzene\n*   ii) -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product).\n*   iii) -> p-tert-butylaniline.\n*   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline (anilinium ion). The -NH3+ at C1 (m-director) and -tBu at C4 (o-director) both direct to C3 and C5. -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nThis sequence locks the substituents into a 1,3,4 pattern, which also cannot lead to the 1,2,3 target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll options are significantly flawed, either containing chemically nonsensical steps or leading to the wrong isomer based on established directing rules. However, Option B is the only one where a hypothetical (albeit low-yield and mechanistically questionable) path to the correctly substituted final product can be constructed. The question likely relies on the student ignoring the low yields and assuming the desired isomer is formed at each conflicting step, and also ignoring the illogical placement of the sulfonation/desulfonation steps. By assuming that o-alkylation of aniline occurs, and that the subsequent nitration yields the required 3-nitro isomer, this path uniquely arrives at the target.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, including the directing effects of various substituents and the sequence in which they are introduced. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene in high yield.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group** (-OEt) at C1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group** (-tBu) at C2.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,2,3. This is a sterically crowded arrangement, which suggests the synthesis will require careful planning.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director. It's a key precursor for forming a diazonium salt, which can be replaced by many other groups (like -OH, which can be converted to -OEt).\n*   **-NH3+ (Anilinium ion)**: In strong acid, an amino group is protonated to form an anilinium ion, which is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes**\n\nLet's evaluate each option by predicting the major product of each step.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by nitration and sulfonation. Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The intermediate produced after step (iii) does not have an amino group, so this step is chemically impossible in this sequence. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   i) `tBuCl/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: The bulky t-Bu group directs the sulfonation to the para position. -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This blocks the para position.\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The t-Bu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-Bu group (C2). -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   The resulting substitution pattern is 1,2,4, which cannot be converted to the required 1,2,3 pattern. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `tBuCl/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The bulky t-Bu group directs nitration mainly to the para position. -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. -> p-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group becomes -NH3+ (a meta-director) and the -tBu group is an ortho-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the position between them (C3 relative to -NH3+, C3 relative to -tBu). -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   The resulting substitution pattern is 1,3,4, which cannot be converted to the required 1,2,3 pattern. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this route. Although some steps have potential yield issues, let's see if the logic leads to the correct product. The sequence of steps in the option is jumbled, so we will rearrange them into a chemically logical order for analysis, as this is likely a formatting error in the question.\n    *   **i) `HNO3/H2SO4` on benzene:** -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   **ii) `Fe/HCl` on nitrobenzene:** -> Aniline. This creates the amino group needed for diazotization later.\n    *   **iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on aniline:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic as the Lewis acid reacts with the basic amine. However, it's the only step in any option that could introduce the t-Bu group *ortho* to the nitrogen functional group, establishing the crucial 1,2 relationship. Let's assume the desired *o-tert-butylaniline* is formed, even if in low yield.\n    *   **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on o-tert-butylaniline:** In strong acid, we have the o-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ is a meta-director (directs to C3 and C5) and the -tBu is an o,p-director (directs to C4 and C6). There are competing effects, but nitration at C3 is a possible outcome, giving *3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline*. This establishes the correct 1,2,3 arrangement.\n    *   **v) `NaNO2/HCl` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** This converts the amine (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **viii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt:** This replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding *2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*.\n    *   **ix) `NaOH/EtBr` on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide ion attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ethoxy ether. This gives the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   The steps `vi) SO3/H2SO4` and `vii) dilute H2SO4` are extraneous and misplaced but do not invalidate the core synthetic pathway.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy eliminating the other options which lead to incorrect isomers or involve impossible reactions, Option B remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, route to the target molecule. It correctly uses the versatility of aniline and diazonium salt chemistry to construct the complex 1,2,3 substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a systematic breakdown of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe desired product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The substituents are an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3, meaning all three groups are on adjacent carbons. This is a sterically hindered arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS)**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. Its bulkiness strongly disfavors ortho substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is a precursor to the diazonium group (-N2+), which is an excellent leaving group and can be replaced by -OH.\n*   **-NH3+ (Anilinium)**: When an amine is in strong acid, it becomes protonated. The anilinium ion is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's analyze the major products expected from each reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is incorrect because step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The product from the preceding steps (a nitrated and sulfonated tert-butylbenzene) does not contain an amino group. Thus, this option is chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The bulky t-Bu group directs the large -SO3H group to the para position.\n    *   iii) Nitration. The t-Bu group (ortho-directing) and the -SO3H group (meta-directing) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position at C2 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to -SO3H). The product is 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This sequence establishes a **1,2,4 substitution pattern**, which cannot be converted to the desired 1,2,3 pattern of the target molecule. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para product is heavily favored over the ortho product due to the steric hindrance of the t-Bu group.\n    *   iii) Reduction of the nitro group → p-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In the acidic medium, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. Both the -NH3+ group at C1 and the -tBu group at C4 direct the new nitro group to the C3 position.\n    *   This sequence establishes a **1,3,4 substitution pattern**. This is also the wrong isomer. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This option appears to contain some misplaced or extraneous steps (`vi`, `vii`), and some steps are chemically problematic for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. However, let's trace the core transformations to see if they can lead to the correct isomer.\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with `tBuCl/AlCl3`. **(Note: This reaction is known to fail in practice because the Lewis acid catalyst deactivates the ring by complexing with the basic amino group.)** However, assuming for the sake of the problem that the intended *ortho* product is formed, we get o-tert-butylaniline. This is the only way in any of the options to establish the crucial 1,2 relationship between the nitrogen and the tert-butyl group.\n    *   iv) Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline. (The regiochemistry is complex, but this is a possible, though likely minor, product that leads to the target's 1,2,3 pattern).\n    *   v) Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) of the amino group → a diazonium salt.\n    *   viii) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   ix) Williamson Ether Synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) on the phenol → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they either involve impossible reactions or lead to the wrong isomers (1,2,4 or 1,3,4 patterns). Option B is the only sequence that outlines a plausible (though synthetically very challenging and low-yielding in reality) pathway to the correct 1,2,3-substituted product.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe final product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-butyl (-tBu) at C2, and Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and competing directing effects.\n\n### 2. Key Synthetic Transformations\n\nTo get an ethoxy group (-OEt), a common method is the Williamson ether synthesis, which requires a phenol (-OH) group. A phenol can often be made from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. This suggests that a key intermediate will be an aniline derivative.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will trace the major products for each proposed synthetic route.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director, but its large size strongly favors substitution at the para position. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`.\n*   iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This reaction is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from the previous steps does not contain an amine group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a chemically impossible step. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n*   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Again, the bulky -tBu group directs the large sulfonyl group to the para position, forming `p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n*   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming electrophile to the position ortho to the -tBu group. The product is `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This route leads to a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which is the wrong isomer. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration gives `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` as the major product.\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group yields `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of `p-tert-butylaniline`. In the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C4 is an ortho-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position. The product is `3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This route leads to a 1,3,4-substitution pattern, which is the wrong isomer. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\nThis sequence is long, and the numbering seems disordered, but let's trace the core chemical transformations to see if it leads to the correct product.\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4` on benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl` on nitrobenzene → **Aniline**. This correctly forms the crucial amine intermediate.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on aniline. While Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic in practice (the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amine), let's assume the question intends for the reaction to proceed. To get the target molecule, the -tBu group must be introduced ortho to the amine, yielding `o-tert-butylaniline`.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on `o-tert-butylaniline`. The amine becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), a meta-director. So the -NH3+ at C1 directs to C3, and the -tBu at C2 directs to C4 and C6. For the final product, nitration must occur at C3, giving `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. This creates the required 1,2,3 pattern.\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl` on the amino group creates the diazonium salt.\n*   viii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis of the diazonium salt) replaces the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`.\n*   ix) `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt), yielding the final target: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The steps `vi) SO3/H2SO4` and `vii) dilute H2SO4` are extraneous to the core pathway and likely serve as distractors.\n*   **Conclusion:** Despite the practical difficulties of some steps, this is the only sequence that presents a logical (though not high-yield) path to the correctly substituted 1,2,3-isomer. By eliminating the other options that lead to incorrect isomers or involve impossible reactions, this must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to identify the correct synthetic route.\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Synthetic Strategies in the Options\nThe final ethoxy group (-OEt) is a strong ortho,para-director. It's often installed late in a synthesis via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/R-X`) from a phenol (-OH). A phenol, in turn, can be created from a primary amine (-NH2) using a Sandmeyer-like reaction (diazotization with `NaNO2/HCl` followed by hydrolysis with `H3O+`). This amine -> diazonium -> phenol -> ether sequence is a powerful tool for controlling substitution patterns and is a key feature to look for.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option by predicting the major products.\n\n#### **Option A: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene`. The t-Bu group is an ortho,para-director, but its extreme bulk heavily favors para-substitution. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`.\n3.  **Step iv):** Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The molecule produced in the preceding steps does not have an amino group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option C: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Sulfonation of `tert-butylbenzene`. Due to the steric hindrance of both the t-Bu and -SO3H groups, the substitution occurs at the para position, yielding `p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n3.  **Step iii):** Nitration. Now the t-Bu group directs ortho (since para is blocked) and the -SO3H group directs meta. Both direct to the position at C2. The product is `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n#### **Option D: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene` gives `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` as the major product.\n3.  **Step iii):** Reduction of the nitro group with `Fe/HCl` gives `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n4.  **Step iv):** Nitration of `p-tert-butylaniline`. In the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. Both the -NH3+ at C1 and the -tBu at C4 direct the incoming nitro group to the position between them (C3). The product is `3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to a **1,3,4-substitution pattern**, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n#### **Option B: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tBuCl/AlCl3 ...`**\nLet's analyze the core transformations in this sequence. Although some steps have low yields in practice and the step order is listed confusingly, it is the only remaining possibility.\n1.  **Step i):** `HNO3/H2SO4` on benzene → `Nitrobenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** `Fe/HCl` on `Nitrobenzene` → `Aniline`. This correctly creates the amine handle for further transformations.\n3.  **Step iii):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on `Aniline`. While Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic, let's assume the question intends for it to work. To get the final product, the t-Bu group must be installed ortho to the amine, giving `o-tert-butylaniline`. This is the only way presented in the options to create the necessary 1,2-arrangement of the nitrogen and t-butyl groups.\n4.  **Step iv):** `HNO3/H2SO4` on `o-tert-butylaniline`. In strong acid, we get the o-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ (meta-director) and the -tBu (ortho,para-director) have competing effects. However, substitution at C3 is a possible outcome and is the only one that leads to the required 1,2,3-pattern, forming `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n5.  **Step v):** `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amine into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **Step viii):** `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`.\n7.  **Step ix):** `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the ethoxy ether, yielding the final target product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Despite some steps being non-ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this is the only option that presents a plausible chemical pathway to the correct isomer. The other options are definitively wrong as they lead to incorrect isomers or involve impossible reactions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
