    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the term \"Impulse Approximation\".**\n    *   The core idea is that an interaction with a nucleon *inside* a nucleus is treated as if the interaction were with a *free* nucleon.\n    *   \"Impulse\" implies a very rapid interaction, like a sharp kick. The duration of the interaction is assumed to be much shorter than any characteristic timescale of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus.\n\n2.  **Analyze each proposed assumption:**\n\n    *   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n        *   This is the foundational assumption. The impulse approximation is a model for a *one-body* interaction. If the external probe could interact with multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., through meson-exchange currents), the entire premise of treating the interaction as occurring on a single, isolated particle would fail. Therefore, this assumption is essential. It isolates the interaction to a single target.\n\n    *   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n        *   This deals with what happens *before* and *after* the primary interaction. If the incoming probe scatters off other nucleons before hitting the target, or if the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) re-interact with the \"spectator\" nucleons, then the final measured state is not purely a result of the primary impulse interaction. These are known as \"final-state interactions\" (and initial-state interactions). To treat the process as clean as a free-nucleon interaction, one must assume these other interactions do not happen. This is the \"transparency\" assumption. In a more formal context, this is called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), where the incoming and outgoing particles are described by plane waves that are not distorted by the surrounding nuclear medium. This assumption is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation.\n\n    *   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n        *   This assumption concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself (a proton or neutron). The question of whether the quarks inside are relativistic or not is a separate layer of physics, dealt with by models of the nucleon like the Constituent Quark Model (non-relativistic) or the parton model used in Deep Inelastic Scattering (relativistic). The impulse approximation itself is about neglecting the *nuclear environment's* effect on the nucleon *as a whole* during the scattering. One can apply the impulse approximation and still use a fully relativistic description of the nucleon's internal structure. In fact, for high-energy scattering, this is standard practice. Therefore, this assumption is *not* a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n    *   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n        *   This is the essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The nucleon is bound inside the nucleus by the strong force, meaning it sits in a potential well. This binding affects its energy and momentum. The impulse approximation posits that the interaction is so fast (i.e., involves a large energy and momentum transfer) that during the brief moment of interaction, the nucleon's state is essentially \"frozen.\" It doesn't have time to respond to the binding forces from its neighbors. It behaves, for that instant, as a free particle with a specific initial momentum but without the influence of the binding potential. This is a key part of the approximation.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the analysis:**\n    *   Assumption 1 is required to define the target as a single nucleon.\n    *   Assumption 2 is required to ensure the particles involved in the primary interaction don't get distorted by the rest of the nucleus.\n    *   Assumption 4 is required to justify treating the target nucleon as \"free\" from the nuclear potential *during* the interaction.\n    *   Assumption 3 is a separate, unrelated approximation about the nucleon's internal structure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The set of assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
