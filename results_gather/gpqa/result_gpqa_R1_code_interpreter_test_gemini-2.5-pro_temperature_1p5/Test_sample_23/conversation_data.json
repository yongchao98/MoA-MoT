    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's use this fraction to determine the relationship between n and m. The mass of a carbon atom is approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu) and a hydrogen atom is 1 amu.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of molecule)\n    *   `1/7 = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1)`\n    *   `12n + m = 7m`\n    *   `12n = 6m`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), so it must be a cycloalkane. The general formula CnH2n matches that of cycloalkanes.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common liquid cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Network.**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This is a critical piece of information. It means all components in both mixtures must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) upon heating and undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components (let's call them X1 and X2) are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components (Y1 and Y2) are saturated or unreactive towards bromine water (like aromatic compounds).\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   The disproportionation reaction over a platinum catalyst, starting from unsaturated cyclic compounds, strongly suggests the formation of a stable aromatic compound and a fully saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   Given that all compounds share the same carbon skeleton and Z is a common cycloalkane solvent, the most plausible scenario involves a six-membered ring system. This would make Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane, the disproportionation product that is dehydrogenated would be **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is exceptionally stable and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y must yield only Z. Let's check this hypothesis:\n        *   Y is an equimolar mixture. One component is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). So, Y1 = Cyclohexane.\n        *   The other component, Y2, would be Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (Y1) gives cyclohexane (Z) as it's already saturated.\n        *   Hydrogenation of benzene (Y2) under severe conditions (as stated) gives cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} produces only one substance, Z = cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n        *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X (containing X1 and X2) reacts to form mixture Y (containing Y1 and Y2).\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   Since it's a disproportionation reaction (hydrogen transfer), the number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n    *   Focusing on hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(Y1) + H_atoms(Y2)\n    *   We identified Y1 as cyclohexane (C6H12) and Y2 as benzene (C6H6).\n    *   H_atoms(Y1) = 12\n    *   H_atoms(Y2) = 6\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is: `12 + 6 = 18`.\n\n5.  **Verify the Plausibility of Mixture X.**\n    *   Let's check if we can find two liquids, X1 and X2, that fit the description.\n    *   We need `H(X1) + H(X2) = 18`.\n    *   They must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds without conjugated double bonds, and both must hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Possible candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond, so it's unsaturated. Not conjugated. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. It's a liquid.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are isolated (non-conjugated). Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. It's a liquid.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen count: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. The diene loses 2H and the ene gains 2H. This is a chemically sound reaction.\n    *   All conditions are satisfied by this model.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom conservation principle applied to the disproportionation reaction, this sum is 18.\n\n```python\n# The problem is solved by chemical reasoning.\n# The core logic is the conservation of hydrogen atoms during the disproportionation reaction.\n# Reactants: X1, X2\n# Products: Y1, Y2\n# H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(Y1) + H_atoms(Y2)\n#\n# Reasoning identified Y1 as Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Y2 as Benzene (C6H6).\n#\nH_atoms_in_Cyclohexane = 12\nH_atoms_in_Benzene = 6\n#\n# Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products,\n# which equals the total number in the reactants.\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = H_atoms_in_Cyclohexane + H_atoms_in_Benzene\n#\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Detailed reasoning and thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass of hydrogen is ~1 g/mol and the mass of carbon is ~12 g/mol. Let the formula of Z be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28%, or approximately 1/7:\n        `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n        `7m = 12n + m`\n        `6m = 12n`\n        `m = 2n`\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is formed by hydrogenation of other compounds and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is described as a widely used solvent. The most common liquid cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its Formation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a heated platinum catalyst. This type of reaction, especially with cyclic compounds over platinum, often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to both more saturated and less saturated (often aromatic) products.\n    *   Mixture Y consists of two equimolar liquids and does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   One of the components of mixture Y *is* substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call this Y1.\n    *   Let the other component be Y2. Since hydrogenating the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, Y2 must also have a C6 carbon skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y2 is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water and is formed by dehydrogenation (part of the disproportionation), the most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene has a C6 skeleton, is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as mentioned in the problem) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Y1 (cyclohexane) + Y2 (benzene)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of Y1 and one molecule of Y2).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n4.  **Verification (Checking the properties of Mixture X):**\n    *   We need to find two C6 compounds, X1 and X2, that fit the description.\n    *   They must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n    *   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and 10 H atoms.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Both are C6 cyclic compounds, will decolorize bromine water, and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the ene is hydrogenated to the alkane. This confirms our reasoning is chemically sound.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation, based on the identified products of the disproportionation, shows this sum is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
