    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers, called tautomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Hybridization and Alpha-Hydrogens:** In benzoquinone, all these alpha-carbons are part of C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. There are no sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with available hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are C2, C4, and C6. These are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Hybridization and Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has acidic alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp²-hybridized and are part of a double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism. (It does show geometrical isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Result for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
