    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars as a function of parallax (`plx`) varies as `1/plx^5`. Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The phrase \"varies with parallax\" in this context refers to the number density of stars per unit of parallax. So, the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN`, and the density is `dN/d(plx)`. The given relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n    *   **To Find:** How the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is the number density of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n    *   **Key Relationship:** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. For a parallax `plx` in arcseconds and a distance `r` in parsecs, the relationship is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n\n2.  **Formulate a Mathematical Strategy:**\n    We need to transform the number density from parallax coordinates to distance coordinates. The number of stars `dN` in a particular set is an invariant quantity, regardless of the coordinate system used to describe it.\n    The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`.\n    This can be expressed as:\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx) = (dN/dr) * dr`\n\n    We can find `dN/dr` by using the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n        We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n        Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Substitute the known quantities into the chain rule equation.**\n        We have:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`\n\n        Substituting these into the chain rule formula:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Express the right-hand side purely in terms of `r`.**\n        We use the relationship `plx = 1/r` to replace `plx` in the expression.\n        `1/plx^5 = 1/(1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n        Now substitute this back into the expression for `dN/dr`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²) = -r^(5-2) = -r³`\n\n4.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us about the proportionality. The number of stars in a given distance shell `dr`, which is `(dN/dr)dr`, must be a positive quantity. The negative sign arises from the fact that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (an inverse relationship). When considering number densities or distributions, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship.\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived relationship is `~ r³`, which matches option D.\n\n    *   A) ~ r^4\n    *   B) ~ r^5\n    *   C) ~ r^2\n    *   D) ~ r^3\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
