    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The combination of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Substrate:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating and *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   **Products:** The nitration of toluene yields two main products: *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* isomer is typically the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems of this nature, we usually assume the major product is carried forward to the next step.\n*   **Product 1:** Therefore, Product 1 is **4-nitrotoluene** (or *p*-nitrotoluene).\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves the oxidation of 4-nitrotoluene. The reagent MnO₂ (manganese dioxide), often used with acid, is a specific oxidizing agent. While strong oxidants like KMnO₄ would oxidize the benzylic methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), MnO₂ can be used for the selective oxidation of benzylic positions to the aldehyde (-CHO) stage.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** If we were to assume oxidation to the carboxylic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid), the subsequent reaction in Step 3 does not lead to a product whose symmetry matches any of the given options (as analyzed below). Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the reaction stops at the aldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group. The nitro group (-NO₂) is unaffected. Thus, Product 2 is **4-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed condensation reaction between an aldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). This specific type of reaction is known as a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The strong base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) to form an enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  An aldol addition product is formed initially.\n    4.  This intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water) because the resulting double bond is highly conjugated with both the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The more stable *trans* (*E*) isomer is preferentially formed. The structure is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n     \n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one:\n    `p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n*   **Conformation:** Due to the extensive system of conjugated π-bonds (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), the molecule preferentially adopts a planar conformation to maximize orbital overlap.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Assuming the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the heavy atoms (C, N, O) and the vinylic and phenyl hydrogens is a plane of symmetry. The methyl group (-CH₃) has a carbon atom in this plane, and its three hydrogen atoms can be oriented such that one is in the plane and the other two are symmetrically positioned above and below it. Therefore, the molecule possesses one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (other than C₁, the identity). A C₂ axis is not present because rotating the molecule 180° does not result in an identical structure (e.g., the NO₂ group would move to the position of the butenone chain).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, and its molecular symmetry group is Cₛ. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
