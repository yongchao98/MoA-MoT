    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two other groups (substituents) attached to it.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**.\n    *   A peak indicates an **aromatic-halogen bond (C-X)**, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Identify the Substituents and Propose a Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    1.  A halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  A group containing the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's find a group with the formula C₂ and C=O. The most common and stable such group is the **acetyl group**, -C(=O)CH₃.\n*   Combining these pieces, the molecule is a **halo-acetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n    *   This structure has a di-substituted benzene ring. (✓)\n    *   It has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 total carbons. (✓)\n    *   It has a carbonyl group. (✓)\n    *   It has an aromatic-halogen bond. (✓)\n    *   The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means it should have 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the ring, 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**3. Analyze the Possible Isomers and Predict their ¹H NMR Spectra:**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can have three positional isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-isomers:** These isomers are asymmetric. They would have four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (typically four separate signals with complex splitting like doublets, triplets, etc.).\n*   **Para-isomer:** The para-halo-acetophenone (4-halo-acetophenone) is highly symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-C4 axis.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs. The two protons next to the acetyl group (Hₐ) are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen (Hₑ) are equivalent.\n    *   The Hₐ protons will couple with their adjacent Hₑ protons, appearing as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The Hₑ protons will couple with their adjacent Hₐ protons, appearing as another **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will not be split and will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n\n*   **Predicted ¹H NMR Spectrum for para-halo-acetophenone:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~7.5-8.0 ppm): One doublet (2H) and another doublet (2H).\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.0-2.5 ppm): One singlet (3H).\n    *   Total protons: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a singlet in the aliphatic region for 3H.\n    *   The chemical shifts are appropriate: ~7.7 ppm for aromatic protons next to electron-withdrawing groups and ~2.3 ppm for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃).\n    *   This data is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of **para-halo-acetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a structure like para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which also fits the initial description.\n    *   However, in such a structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) should be split by the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-), appearing as a triplet (t). Similarly, the methylene protons should be split by the aldehyde proton, appearing as a doublet (d). The data lists both as singlets (s), which is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons, which typically appear above 6.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not one. The chemical shifts are also not characteristic of the proposed aromatic structure. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the given criteria is A. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
