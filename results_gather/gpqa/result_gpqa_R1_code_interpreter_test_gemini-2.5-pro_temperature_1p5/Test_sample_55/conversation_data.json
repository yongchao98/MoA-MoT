    "An analysis of the two-dipole transition from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ in a hydrogen atom involves applying the electric dipole (E1) selection rules and calculating the corresponding branching ratios for the decay cascade.\n\n**1. Identify the Transition Path**\n\nThe decay occurs in two steps, involving an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the E1 selection rules for each step:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, $n'<3$. A direct transition to $n'=1$ is not possible, as for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is allowed, which would violate $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that from $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Let's check if the transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (allowed).\n*   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (allowed).\n*   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n*   So, any of the paths $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$ are valid transition routes. All options A, B, and C propose valid routes.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Probability**\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio of a specific cascade path. This is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n**Probability of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n*   The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0, m=0$). When such a state decays, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final state (with a specific $l'$) are equal, assuming we average over all emission directions and polarizations. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and rotational symmetry.\n*   Let $\\Gamma_{m'} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$. Then $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_{-1}$.\n*   The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n*   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to follow the specific path to the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is:\n    $P(\\text{Step 1 to } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Similarly, the probability to transition to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is 1/3, and to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also 1/3.\n\n**Probability of Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Once the atom is in an excited state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to a lower energy state.\n*   The only state with energy lower than $n=2$ is the $n=1$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   As we established, the dipole transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Since this is the only possible decay channel via an electric dipole transition from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of this second step occurring is 1 (i.e., the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade**\nThe probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each independent step. Let's evaluate the path given in option A:\n*   Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Probability = $P(\\text{Step 1 to } |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(\\text{Step 2 from } |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n*   Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Comparing with the Options**\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This matches our calculation exactly.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but our calculated probability is 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but our calculated probability is 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The path is correct, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only choice that provides both a correct transition route and the correct corresponding probability.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
