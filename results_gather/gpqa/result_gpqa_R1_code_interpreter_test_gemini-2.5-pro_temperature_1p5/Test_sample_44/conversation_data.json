    "*   **1. Understanding the System and Principles**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, since they are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this system are quantized and given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    *   The problem provides a simplified energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   Since the particles have spin-1/2, each spatial energy level (defined by n) can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up ($m_s = +1/2$) and one with spin down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n*   **2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The first energy level (n=1) has energy $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$. It can hold two particles.\n    *   The second energy level (n=2) has energy $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$. It can hold the remaining two particles.\n    *   The configuration for the ground state is two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles:\n        $E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n*   **3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3 (with energy $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$).\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy for the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n*   **4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n    *   The first excited state had an energy of 15E. Let's look for other possible excitations from the ground state configuration (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2).\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n            Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n            Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (where $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$). The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n            Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n*   **5. Summary**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThe calculated energies match option D. I will verify this with a short script.\n```python\n# Define the energy unit E as 1 for simplicity in calculation\nE = 1\n\n# Single-particle energy levels E_n = n^2 * E\ndef energy_level(n):\n    return n**2 * E\n\n# Configurations\n# Ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\nE_gs = (2 * energy_level(1)) + (2 * energy_level(2))\n\n# First excited state: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3\n# Config: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3\nE_1st = (2 * energy_level(1)) + (1 * energy_level(2)) + (1 * energy_level(3))\n\n# Second excited state: We need to find the next lowest energy configuration.\n# Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3\n# Config: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3\nE_2nd_A = (1 * energy_level(1)) + (2 * energy_level(2)) + (1 * energy_level(3))\n# Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3\n# Config: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3\nE_2nd_B = (2 * energy_level(1)) + (2 * energy_level(3))\n# Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4\n# Config: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4\nE_2nd_C = (2 * energy_level(1)) + (1 * energy_level(2)) + (1 * energy_level(4))\n\n# The second excited state is the minimum of these possibilities that is higher than the first excited state.\nE_2nd = min(E_2nd_A, E_2nd_B, E_2nd_C)\n\nprint(f\"Ground State Energy: {E_gs}E\")\nprint(f\"First Excited State Energy: {E_1st}E\")\nprint(f\"Second Excited State Energy: {E_2nd}E\")\n\n```\n<<<\nD\n>>>",
    "**1. Understand the System and Fundamental Principles**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers, in this case, the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `ms`.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this potential are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   ... and so on.\n*   **Spin:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, each spatial energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$) and one with spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up with our four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Fill the lowest level, n=1 ($E_1=E$): We can place two particles here.\n*   Fill the next level, n=2 ($E_2=4E$): We place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state ($E_{gs}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy just above the ground state. We achieve this by making the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of a single particle from an occupied level to an unoccupied one.\n\n*   The ground state configuration has its highest-energy particles in the n=2 level.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   To create the first excited state, we promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possible promotions from the ground state and find the second \"cheapest\" one.\n\n*   **First Excited State (already found):** Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from a lower level, i.e., from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy ($E_{2nd}$) is 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
