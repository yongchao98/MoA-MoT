    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but critically, they both have the **same mass spectrum**, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule. This single piece of information allows us to immediately rule out two of the options:\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight and mass spectrum. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This side reaction would result in a molecule with an extra amino acid residue, leading to a higher molecular weight and a different mass spectrum. This is also inconsistent with the data.\n    *   This leaves us with options C and D, both of which describe isomers â€“ molecules with the same chemical formula and mass but different spatial arrangements.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data:**\n    *   We have two distinct species that are separable by LC and give rise to separate peaks in the NMR spectrum (specifically for the alpha-proton).\n    *   The question now becomes: are these species enantiomers (C) or diastereomers (D)?\n\n3.  **Differentiate Between Enantiomers and Diastereomers:**\n    *   **Enantiomers** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC setup), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore:\n        *   They would produce a single, identical NMR spectrum. You would **not** see two peaks for one proton.\n        *   They would co-elute on a standard (achiral) LC column, resulting in a **single** peak.\n        *   To separate enantiomers or see different NMR signals, you would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral shift reagent in the NMR). The problem does not state that such specialized techniques were used, so we assume standard conditions. Option C is therefore highly unlikely.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment. Therefore:\n        *   They will have distinct NMR spectra. It is expected that they would have different chemical shifts for their protons, leading to two sets of peaks, as observed for the alpha-proton.\n        *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, which explains the two LC peaks.\n\n4.  **Connect to Peptide Chemistry:**\n    *   How could diastereomers form in a peptide synthesis? There are two very common ways:\n        1.  **Epimerization:** One of the chiral alpha-carbons could have its stereochemistry inverted during a reaction step (e.g., from L to D). If the peptide has other chiral centers, this creates a diastereomer.\n        2.  **Cis/Trans Isomerism (Rotamers):** The amide bond (peptide bond) has significant double-bond character, restricting its rotation. This creates two stable conformers: *cis* and *trans*. These rotamers are diastereomers of each other (assuming other chiral centers are present). The energy barrier to their interconversion is often high enough that they can be observed as separate species on the NMR timescale at room temperature, leading to a doubling of nearby peaks (like the alpha-proton). This is especially common for bonds involving a proline residue, where the *cis* and *trans* forms can exist in nearly equal amounts, matching the \"roughly equal integrals\" observation. These distinct rotamers can also be separated by LC.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two separable species (by LC) that are isomers (same mass) and have distinct chemical properties (different NMR signals) is the definition of a mixture of diastereomers. The specific context of a peptide strongly suggests that these diastereomers are most likely *cis/trans* rotamers around an amide bond.\n\n<<<D>>>"
