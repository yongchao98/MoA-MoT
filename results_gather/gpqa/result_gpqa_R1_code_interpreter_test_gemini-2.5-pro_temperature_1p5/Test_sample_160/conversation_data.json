    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different mean free paths in the same vacuum chamber:\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding *with each other*.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope beam colliding *with the residual gas molecules*.\n\nThe fundamental formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision.\n\nSince the vacuum state (pressure and temperature) is the same for both scenarios, the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is constant. Therefore, the comparison between λ1 and λ2 boils down to a comparison between their respective collision cross-sections and any other factors affecting the collision rate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n\n*   **Particles involved:** A gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg):** In the hard-sphere model, a collision between two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d` occurs if their centers come within a distance `d` of each other. The moving molecule effectively sweeps out a cylinder with a radius `d`. Thus, the collision cross-section is σ_gg = πd².\n*   **Relative Motion:** In a gas, all molecules are moving randomly. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this increases the collision frequency compared to a scenario with stationary targets. This introduces a factor of `sqrt(2)` into the denominator of the mean free path formula.\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * πd²)\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n\n*   **Particles involved:** A high-energy electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_eg):** An electron is, for all practical purposes, a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to an atom). The target is a gas molecule of diameter `d` (and radius `r = d/2`). A collision occurs if the point-like electron hits the target area of the molecule.\n    Therefore, the collision cross-section is the geometrical area of the molecule: σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4.\n*   **Relative Motion:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them extremely high, relativistic speeds. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. We can, therefore, treat the gas molecules as stationary targets. In this case, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (πd²/4)) = 4 / (n * πd²)\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio λ2 / λ1 using the formulas derived above:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (n * πd²) ] / [ 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * πd²) ]\n\nThe terms `n`, `π`, and `d²` cancel out:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4 * sqrt(2)\n\nTo get a numerical value, we can approximate sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.\n\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nThis means that λ2 is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ1.\n\n### **5. Code-assisted Calculation**\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This code calculates the ratio λ2/λ1 based on the kinetic theory hard-sphere model.\n\n# Let K be a constant representing the common terms: K = n * pi * d^2\n# where n is the number density and d is the diameter of the gas molecule.\n\n# lambda1 is the mean free path for gas-gas collisions.\n# The formula is λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg), where σ_gg = π * d^2.\n# So, lambda1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * K)\n\n# lambda2 is the mean free path for electron-gas collisions.\n# The formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg), where σ_eg = π * (d/2)^2 = (π * d^2)/4.\n# The target gas molecules are considered stationary compared to the high-energy electrons.\n# So, lambda2 = 1 / (n * (π*d^2/4)) = 4 / (n * π * d^2) = 4 / K\n\n# The ratio is λ2 / λ1 = (4/K) / (1/(sqrt(2)*K)) = 4 * sqrt(2).\n\nratio = 4 * math.sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of λ2 / λ1 is: {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\nSuccess\n<execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio of λ2 / λ1 is: 5.656854249492381\n</execute_result>\n</execute_code>\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe calculation shows that λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1. Now let's check the given options:\nA) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect, as 5.66 ≠ 1)\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, as 5.66 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, as 5.66 is not less than 1.22)\nD) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect, as λ2 is larger than λ1)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reasoning, based on the fundamental principles of kinetic theory, clearly shows that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). This is primarily because the collision cross-section is much smaller for the tiny electron, and the relative motion factor for gas-gas collisions further reduces λ1. The calculated ratio of approximately 5.66 comfortably fits the condition specified in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks us to compare the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) with the mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\n### **1. Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n\nThe standard formula for the mean free path of a molecule in a gas composed of identical molecules, from the kinetic theory of gases, is:\n\nλ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n*   `n`: The number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n*   `σ_gg`: The collision cross-section between two gas molecules. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with diameter `d`, a collision occurs if the centers of two molecules get within a distance `d` of each other. The effective target area is therefore a circle of radius `d`, so σ_gg = πd².\n*   `√2`: This factor accounts for the fact that all molecules are in random thermal motion, which increases the collision frequency compared to a scenario where the target molecules are stationary.\n\nSubstituting the cross-section, the formula becomes:\n\nλ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n\n### **2. Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n\nNow, consider the high-energy electrons from the microscope beam traveling through the same gas.\n\n*   `n`: The number density of the target gas molecules is the same.\n*   **Collision Model:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning their velocity is extremely high (relativistic, in fact), far exceeding the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be essentially stationary targets. This means the `√2` factor is not used.\n*   `σ_eg`: The collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. An electron is practically a point particle compared to the size of an atom or molecule. The target is the gas molecule of diameter `d` (or radius `r = d/2`). The electron just needs to hit this target area. The collision cross-section is the geometric area of the molecule: σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of the electron is:\n\nλ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nSubstituting the cross-section, this becomes:\n\nλ₂ = 1 / (n * πd²/4) = 4 / (n * πd²)\n\n### **3. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ₂ to λ₁:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * πd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * πd²) ]\n\nThe terms `n`, `π`, and `d²` cancel out, leaving:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\nThe calculation performed by the code confirms this value:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nThis means λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁. The mean free path of the electrons is over 5 times longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that is consistent with our result λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁.\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1  ->  Incorrect.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1  ->  Correct, since 5.66 is indeed greater than 1.22.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1  -> Incorrect, since 5.66 is not less than 1.22.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1  -> Incorrect, λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path of the electrons is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. Option B is the only choice that accurately reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<B>>>"
