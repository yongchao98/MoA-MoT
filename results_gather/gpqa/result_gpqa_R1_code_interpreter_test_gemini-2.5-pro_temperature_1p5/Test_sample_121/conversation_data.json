    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The goal of this reaction is the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). In acetic acid, the α-carbon is the methyl (CH3) group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction substitutes one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH\n*   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol.\n    *   Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromine atom is on a primary carbon, making it a good leaving group. The cyanide displaces the bromide.\n*   **Product 3:**\n    *   Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step alkylation process.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" meaning there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation. The remaining proton on the α-carbon is still acidic.\n        *   NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    4.  The newly formed carbanion undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentyl chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   The structure of Product 4 is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering its symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping, and there is free rotation about single bonds. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses an effective plane of symmetry (C_s). This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group (-CN), and the carboxyl group (-COO-).\n\nLet's count the signals based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are chemically equivalent due to fast rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- protons:** These two methylene protons are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule (the C_s plane doesn't interchange them). They are diastereotopic. This is because they are attached to an oxygen which is connected to a prochiral center (C1 of the ring). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will produce **2 separate signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = **3 signals**.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. They are enantiotopic and thus chemically equivalent. They produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 are not related by any symmetry element and are thus diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes one proton on C2 (e.g., the \"axial-like\" one) equivalent to its counterpart on C6. The other proton on C2 (the \"equatorial-like\" one) is equivalent to its counterpart on C6. This results in two distinct sets of protons for the C2/C6 positions. They produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The four protons on these carbons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the cyclohexane ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = **5 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 3 (ethyl) + 5 (ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, which our analysis shows to be 8.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
