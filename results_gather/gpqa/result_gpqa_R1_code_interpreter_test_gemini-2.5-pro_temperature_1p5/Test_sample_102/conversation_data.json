    "This problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. To do this, we need to analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions required for each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule is:\n1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n- The parent structure is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n- There is a bromo group (-Br) at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).\n- There is a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group).\n\nThe substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) are all meta to each other. This substitution pattern (1,3,5) is key to determining the correct order of reactions.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the functional groups we need to introduce:\n-   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: Introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3). It is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n-   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Introduced via bromination (Br2/FeBr3). It is a deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n-   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Introduced via nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). It is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\nNow let's evaluate the reaction sequence proposed in each option.\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.**\n2.  **Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 →** The -Br group is an o,p-director. This step yields a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, with the para isomer being the major product. This does not lead to the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern.\n3.  **1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 →** Friedel-Crafts acylation is very difficult on a ring that is highly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. Even if it were to proceed, the directing effects would not lead to the desired product. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 →** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the acylation reaction from occurring on the ring. This sequence is not feasible.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is introduced. It is a **meta-director**.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine atom is directed to the meta-position (C3).\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 →** We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 and a bromo group at C3.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director, directing the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br) is an ortho-, para-director, directing the incoming nitro group to C2, C4 (ortho), and C5 (para).\n    Both groups direct the nitration to position C5. This is a concerted directing effect, which means the reaction will proceed with high regioselectivity to form **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nThis sequence successfully and efficiently produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv-vii) would modify the product and are not necessary for its synthesis; they appear to be distractors. However, the initial three steps represent a correct and high-yield pathway.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.**\n3.  **Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.**\n4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene.** This is a reductive deamination, which converts the diazonium salt back to a hydrogen atom on the ring. This four-step sequence simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it a nonsensical route for synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only chemically sound sequence that leads to a high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is the one described in the first three steps of option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>"
