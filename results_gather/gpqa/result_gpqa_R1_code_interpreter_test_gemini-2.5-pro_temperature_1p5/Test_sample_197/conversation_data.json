    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and equilibria:**\n    In a solution of cobalt(II) and thiocyanate (SCN-), a series of complexes can form. The species containing cobalt are the free hydrated Co(II) ion, `[Co(H2O)6]^2+` (we'll denote this as `Co^2+`), and the thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n    The formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β_n):\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` ; `β1 = [Co(SCN)^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [Co(SCN)3]^- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n3.  **Express concentrations in terms of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN^-]`:**\n    Using the stability constant expressions, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n    Substituting these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the mole fraction of the target species:**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the **dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex**, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`. The percentage is its mole fraction (α2) multiplied by 100.\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from above:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values and compute:**\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN^-]` with the given total concentration. The amount of SCN- bound in complexes is small compared to the total amount.\n    *   `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`.\n\n    Let's calculate the numerator and denominator separately. Let `L = [SCN^-] = 0.1 M`.\n\n    *   Numerator (`N2`): `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator (`D`): `1 + β1*L + β2*L^2 + β3*L^3 + β4*L^4`\n        *   `1 = 1`\n        *   `β1*L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2*L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3*L^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4*L^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n        *   `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   `α2 = N2 / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    To get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is very close to 16.9%.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator of the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all species\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*SCN_conc + beta2*(SCN_conc**2) + beta3*(SCN_conc**3) + beta4*(SCN_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482278\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 38.1% (This corresponds to the monothiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)]^+`)\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3% (This corresponds to the free Co(II) ion, `Co^2+`)\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n1.  **Identify the species and equilibria:**\n    The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free hydrated `Co^2+` ion and the series of complexes formed with thiocyanate (`SCN-`): `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the mole fraction (αn):**\n    The mole fraction of any given complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n    The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction multiplied by 100.\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN^-]`, and the stability constants `βn`:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n4.  **Derive the formula for the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` (α2):**\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the definition of `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)` into the `α2` formula:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the formula:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M (Since the thiocyanate concentration is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as the total ligand concentration).\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Plug these values into the formula for `α2`:\n    *   Numerator = `40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n    *   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    To get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\n    This result matches the output from the Python code execution.\n\n<<<B>>>"
