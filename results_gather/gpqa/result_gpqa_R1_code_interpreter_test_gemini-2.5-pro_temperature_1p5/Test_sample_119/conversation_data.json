    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Volume and Number of Stars:** Consider a sphere of radius `r` centered on the observer (Earth). The volume `V` of this sphere is given by the formula:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * r^3`\n\n    The total number of stars `N` within this volume is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N(r) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * r^3`\n\n3.  **Stars in a Thin Shell:** Now, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between radius `r` and `r + dr`. The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is the surface area of the sphere (`4 * π * r^2`) multiplied by its thickness (`dr`):\n    `dV = 4 * π * r^2 * dr`\n\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * r^2 * dr`\n\n4.  **Relating Distance (r) to Parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to a star. By convention, if the distance `r` is measured in parsecs, the parallax `plx` is measured in arcseconds.\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n    This also means `r = 1 / plx`.\n\n5.  **Expressing the Change in Distance (dr) in terms of the Change in Parallax (d(plx)):** We need to find the relationship between `dr` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the expression `r = 1 / plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dr / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx^-1] = -1 * plx^-2 = -1 / plx^2`\n\n    Rearranging this, we get:\n    `dr = - (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When considering the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign for now. It simply relates the direction of change.\n\n6.  **Substituting `r` and `dr` in the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `r` and `dr` in terms of `plx` into our equation for `dN` (the number of stars in a thin shell).\n\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * r^2 * dr`\n    Substitute `r = 1 / plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx)^2 * dr`\n    Substitute `dr = (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx^2) * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n\n    Combine the terms:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n\n    `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx^4)`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The term `ρ * 4 * π` is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN / d(plx)`, is proportional to `1 / plx^4`.\n\n    `dN / d(plx) ~ 1 / plx^4`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
