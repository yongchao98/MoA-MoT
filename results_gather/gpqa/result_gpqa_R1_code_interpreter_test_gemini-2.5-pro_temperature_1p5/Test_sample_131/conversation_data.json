    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of methyl group protons in the mixture. The signals must all be singlets, meaning no splitting from adjacent protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the two equivalent methyls at C1/C3 (6H), the methyl at C2 (3H), and the methyl at C5 (3H). This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two adjacent protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent methyls at C1/C4 (6H) and the equivalent methyls at C2/C3 (6H). This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal for the CH2 groups will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the signal for the CH3 groups will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated immediately.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Eliminate Option A:** This option includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. The observed spectrum only has singlets. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Eliminate Options B and C:** These options both include 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This compound *by itself* produces two aromatic singlets. When mixed with another compound that also has aromatic protons (like 1,2,3,4-TMB or 1,2,4,5-TMB), the mixture would be expected to show at least three aromatic signals (unless there is an accidental overlap of signals, which is less likely). The problem explicitly states there are only two aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture of these two will show **two singlets**. Since each signal corresponds to 2H, their integration ratio will be 2:2, or **1:1**. This is a perfect match with the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **three singlets** in total (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match with the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>"
