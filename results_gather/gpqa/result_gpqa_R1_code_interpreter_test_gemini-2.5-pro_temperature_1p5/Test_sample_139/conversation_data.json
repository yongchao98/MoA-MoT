    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   However, it is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n        *   Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 1 & 5: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\" and \"when heated, [precipitate G] releases B.\"**\n        *   Since B is D₂O, the precipitate G must contain deuterium (D). G decomposes upon heating to release D₂O, which is a characteristic property of a metal deuteroxide (similar to how a metal hydroxide decomposes into a metal oxide and water). So, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n        *   Since G is formed from the reaction of X and Y, the deuterium must originate from one or both of these reactants. Clue 1 states X contains a heavier isotope, which strongly suggests **Substance X contains Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        *   This points towards common deuterated reagents. The most common analogs are powerful reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n        *   This suggests that substance X could be Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) or Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: Reaction of X with Y**\n        *   The reaction is violent (clue 2), releases a gas W (clue 3), and forms a precipitate G (clue 4).\n        *   Crucially, gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's test some possibilities:\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Yes)**\n            *   N₂ (as ¹⁴N₂): 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). (Yes)\n            *   CO (as ¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8). (Yes)\n        *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄**. LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. So let's assume Y is a form of water. The reaction must produce D₂ gas.\n        *   Let's test the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (s) + 4D₂ (g)`\n        *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n            *   **Liquid Y = D₂O** (heavy water). This is consistent.\n            *   **Gas W = D₂**. As shown above, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n            *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃** (Aluminium deuteroxide). This is a solid precipitate. This fits.\n            *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and heavy water: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The released substance is D₂O, which we identified as B. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The alternative, `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4HD(g)`, would produce HD gas, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron, so this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., Pyruvic acid: CH₃-C(=O)-COOH), and thus has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH --(LiAlD₄/H₂O workup)--> R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)`\n        *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). It contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It also clarifies: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements in the formula unit.\n    *   **Mass of Aluminium:** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Mass from Al = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen:** There are 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all of the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Mass from H (as D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated cumulative mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\nA computational check is not necessary for this simple arithmetic.\nFinal verification of the steps and interpretation confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
