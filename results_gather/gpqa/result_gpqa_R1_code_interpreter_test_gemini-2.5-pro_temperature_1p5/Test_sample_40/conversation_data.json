    "This is a classic problem of relativistic velocity addition, often associated with the Fizeau experiment. Let's break down the problem to find the solution.\n\n**1. Define Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **S Frame (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is stationary.\n*   **S' Frame (Glass Frame):** This is the frame of reference moving with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n**2. Identify the Velocities**\n\n*   **v:** The velocity of the S' frame (the glass) relative to the S frame (the laboratory). The problem states this is `v`, and it's in the same direction as the light beam.\n*   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the S' frame (the glass). This is the speed of light *inside* the glass. The index of refraction `n` is defined as `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the S frame (the laboratory). This is the value we need to find.\n\n**3. Calculate u'**\n\nWe are given that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\nFrom the definition of the index of refraction, `n = c / u'`, we can find `u'`:\n`u' = c / n`\nSince `c = 1`, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is:\n`u' = 1 / n`\n\n**4. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\nThe Lorentz velocity addition formula is used to find the resultant velocity `u` when adding velocities `u'` and `v`:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we know (`c=1` and `u'=1/n`) into this formula.\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n`u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n`u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n`u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis is the speed of light in the moving glass as observed from the laboratory.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n*   B) 1\n*   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n*   D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nOur derived result `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
