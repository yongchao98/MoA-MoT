    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle as N tends to infinity. The radius of this limiting circle will be equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nThe problem is thus transformed into finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This is a classic problem in physics, and the resulting far-field diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity of the diffraction pattern at an angle θ from the central axis is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ)]²\n\nWhere:\n*   I₀ is the intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n*   J₁ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\nThe minima of the intensity pattern occur when the numerator, J₁(k * a * sinθ), is zero, while the denominator is non-zero. This corresponds to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x), where x = k * a * sinθ.\n\nThe zeros of J₁(x) are a known series of values (excluding x=0, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n*   The first zero, j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   The second zero, j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156\n*   The third zero, j₁,₃ ≈ 10.1735, and so on.\n\nWe are interested in the angular positions of the first two minima, which we'll call θ₁ and θ₂.\n\nFor the first minimum (m=1):\nk * a * sin(θ₁) = j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317\n(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) ≈ 3.8317\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation, sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)\nθ₁ ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)\n\nFor the second minimum (m=2):\nk * a * sin(θ₂) = j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156\n(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) ≈ 7.0156\n\nUsing the small angle approximation:\n(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)\nθ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.610 * (λ / a)]\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5066 * (λ / a)\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it directly:\nΔθ = (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = (3.1839) / (2π) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two)\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a (This is related to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, which involves the first maximum of one pattern overlapping the first minimum of another. It's approximately 2 * 0.610)\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 0.507 λ / a matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
