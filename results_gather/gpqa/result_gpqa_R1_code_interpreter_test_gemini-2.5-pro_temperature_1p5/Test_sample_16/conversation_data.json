    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation is given as the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Set up the dissociation reaction.**\n    Since we are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it is more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation, $K_d$, is the reciprocal of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of the free ions are 0.\n\n| | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $EDTA^{4-}$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M |\n| **Change (C)** | -x | +x | +x |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x | x | x |\n\n4.  **Solve the equilibrium expression.**\n    Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the complex is very stable, and the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of Ca2+ ions (x).**\n    To solve for x, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_concentration = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10\n\n# The dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# The equilibrium equation is Kd = x^2 / (initial_concentration - x)\n# We can approximate this as Kd = x^2 / initial_concentration\n# x^2 = Kd * initial_concentration\nx_squared = Kd * initial_concentration\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of Ca2+ ions is x\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation shows that $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n$[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 5.0x10^-3 M\nD) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the equilibrium reaction:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, represented as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is formed from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA ligand ($EDTA^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is given as $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we are starting with the complex and want to find how much of it dissociates, it is easier to work with the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant, $K_f$:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\nLet's assume the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $EDTA^{4-}$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M |\n| **Change (C)** | -x | +x | +x |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x | x | x |\n\n**3. Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\nUsing the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of $K_d$:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\nSo,\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the formation constant $K_f$ is very large, the complex is very stable. This means the dissociation constant $K_d$ is very small, and the complex will barely dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium.\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo perform this calculation accurately, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Initial concentration of the complex\nC_complex = 0.02  # M\n# Formation constant\nK_f = 5e10\n\n# The dissociation constant is the reciprocal of the formation constant\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_d = x^2 / (C_complex - x)\n# We approximate C_complex - x ≈ C_complex\n# So, K_d ≈ x^2 / C_complex\n# Rearranging for x^2: x^2 ≈ K_d * C_complex\nx_squared = K_d * C_complex\n\n# x is the concentration of Ca^2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThe calculated value of x is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 5.0x10^-3 M\nD) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated concentration $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
