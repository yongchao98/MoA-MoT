    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside it, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   **Induced Charges:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will polarize the conductor. To understand the effect, consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0$). This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero ($Q_{enclosed} = 0$).\n    *   Since the original charge $+q$ is inside the cavity (and thus inside our Gaussian surface), a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the total enclosed charge zero. This induced charge $-q$ will not be distributed uniformly on the inner surface; it will be more concentrated on the side closer to the $+q$ charge.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface of the cavity, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and the Outer Surface:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electrostatic effects of any charges inside it. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, which means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely independent of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$). The $+q$ charge on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the charges inside did not exist.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** For a spherical conductor, the charge on its outer surface will distribute itself uniformly to minimize repulsion, creating a uniform surface charge density. This is the only distribution that ensures the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** Now, the problem of finding the electric field at point P outside the conductor simplifies. We only need to consider the field produced by the uniform shell of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined effect of the charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the charge on the outer surface is $+q$, and it's distributed uniformly over a sphere centered at the center of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total effective charge producing the field at point P is $+q$.\n    *   This effective charge is located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The detailed information about the cavity's position ($s$), its radius ($r$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor, due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derivation.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
