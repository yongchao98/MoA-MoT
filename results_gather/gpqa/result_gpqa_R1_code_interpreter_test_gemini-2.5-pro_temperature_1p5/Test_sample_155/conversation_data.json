    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture by two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr   H\n         \\ /\n          C=C\n         / \\\n        H   Pr  (where Pr = propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction where water acts as the nucleophile. The mechanism is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond), causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound.\n    *   Starting with the racemic mixture of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) epoxides, the *anti*-opening leads to the same single product for both enantiomers.\n    *   Opening of (4R, 5R)-epoxide gives *meso*-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of (4S, 5S)-epoxide also gives *meso*-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr Pr\n         \\ /\n          C=C\n         / \\\n        H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. The resulting (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes *anti*-addition of water.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene (or its meso epoxide derivative) is that it produces a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the *meso*-epoxide gives (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other equivalent carbon gives the enantiomer, (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships between these compounds are:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers**.\n*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of compound 2.\n*   Compound 1 is also a **diastereomer** of compound 3.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**A) Standard (Achiral) HPLC:**\n*   A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase.\n*   It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The racemic pair of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S)-diol will produce one peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated and will elute at different times. The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will produce a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, which allows for their separation. The (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) enantiomers will elute at different times, producing two separate peaks.\n*   Diastereomers are also separated. The *meso*-diol will elute separately from the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for each unique stereoisomer in the mixture).\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the R,R enantiomer, and one for the S,S enantiomer).\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
