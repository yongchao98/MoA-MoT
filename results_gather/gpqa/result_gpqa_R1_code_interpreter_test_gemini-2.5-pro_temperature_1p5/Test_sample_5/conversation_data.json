    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:** The given potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). It's given in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ). The structure of the potential, with r^2 terms, suggests a relationship to the harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often easier to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion relations are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Using these, we can express the terms in the potential as functions of x and y:\n    *   The first term is 1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2).\n    *   The second term is 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 kx^2.\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:** Combine the terms involving x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Separate the Hamiltonian:** The potential is now expressed as a sum of a function of x only and a function of y only: V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\n    This means the Hamiltonian of the system, H = T + V, is separable. The total energy E will be the sum of the energy eigenvalues from the independent motions in the x and y directions: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energy Eigenvalues:** The potential terms V_x(x) and V_y(y) are the potentials of one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The general potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator is V(q) = 1/2 k_eff * q^2, and its energy spectrum is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, with the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_eff/m).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        V_x(x) = 2kx^2. Comparing this to the general form 1/2 k_eff_x * x^2, we find the effective spring constant k_eff_x = 4k.\n        The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n        ω_x = sqrt(k_eff_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the motion in x are:\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. Comparing this to the general form 1/2 k_eff_y * y^2, we find the effective spring constant k_eff_y = k.\n        The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n        ω_y = sqrt(k_eff_y / m) = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the motion in y are:\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:** The total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}, where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
