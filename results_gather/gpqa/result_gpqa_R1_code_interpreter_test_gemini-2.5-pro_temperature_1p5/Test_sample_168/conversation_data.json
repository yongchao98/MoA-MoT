    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete):**\n    *   The original decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. The final state consists of 6 particles (assuming A and B are distinct). In any particle decay or reaction, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. When the final state consists of three or more particles, the available energy (the Q-value) can be distributed among them in a continuous range of ways.\n    *   Consequently, the energy of any one particle (or a subgroup of particles, like the two E particles) is not fixed but can vary, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum. The problem statement confirms this for the original decay.\n    *   The new, exotic decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. The final state now consists of 5 particles. Since this is still a multi-body final state (more than two particles), the energy will again be shared among the products in a continuous distribution.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles will remain **continuous**. This eliminates options C and D, which suggest the spectrum becomes discrete. A discrete spectrum (a sharp energy peak) is characteristic of a two-body decay, where the energies of the outgoing particles are uniquely determined by conservation laws.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum:**\n    *   The endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible energy that the observed particles (the two E particles) can carry. This maximum energy is determined by the total energy released in the reaction, known as the Q-value.\n    *   The Q-value is the amount of rest mass that is converted into kinetic energy. It is calculated as the initial total rest energy minus the final total rest energy: Q = E_rest(initial) - E_rest(final). The endpoint of the total kinetic energy spectrum for the E particles will be approximately equal to the Q-value of the reaction (ignoring the small recoil energy of the heavy B nucleons).\n    *   Let's calculate the Q-values for both decays. Let m_X be the mass of particle X.\n\n3.  **Calculate and Compare the Q-values:**\n    *   **Original Decay (Process 1):** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n        *   Initial rest energy: E_rest(initial) = 2 * m_A * c²\n        *   Final rest energy: E_rest(final, 1) = 2 * m_B * c² + 2 * m_E * c² + 2 * m_V * c²\n        *   Q-value for original decay: Q₁ = E_rest(initial) - E_rest(final, 1) = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c²\n\n    *   **Exotic Decay (Process 2):** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n        *   Initial rest energy: E_rest(initial) = 2 * m_A * c²\n        *   Final rest energy: E_rest(final, 2) = 2 * m_B * c² + 2 * m_E * c² + m_M * c²\n        *   The problem states that particle M is **massless**, so m_M = 0.\n        *   E_rest(final, 2) = 2 * m_B * c² + 2 * m_E * c²\n        *   Q-value for exotic decay: Q₂ = E_rest(initial) - E_rest(final, 2) = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c²\n\n4.  **Compare the Endpoints:**\n    *   Now, compare Q₂ with Q₁.\n    *   Q₂ - Q₁ = [(2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c²] - [(2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c²]\n    *   Q₂ - Q₁ = 2 * m_V * c²\n    *   The identity of particle V is crucial. In the context of nuclear decays, V (or ν) is the standard symbol for a neutrino. It is a well-established experimental fact that neutrinos have a small but non-zero mass (m_V > 0).\n    *   Since m_V > 0, it follows that Q₂ - Q₁ is a positive value. Therefore, Q₂ > Q₁.\n    *   The endpoint of the E-particle energy spectrum is determined by the Q-value. Since the Q-value for the exotic decay (Q₂) is greater than the Q-value for the original decay (Q₁), the endpoint of the spectrum for the exotic decay will be higher.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because the decay is still a multi-body process. The endpoint of the spectrum increases because replacing two massive V particles (neutrinos) with one massless M particle reduces the total rest mass of the final products, thus increasing the total energy (Q-value) released as kinetic energy.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
