    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This eliminates option B, which is a secondary amide (-NH-).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   An **ester** C=O stretch typically appears at 1735-1750 cm⁻¹. Conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring lowers this frequency to about 1715-1730 cm⁻¹. The value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n    *   An **amide** C=O stretch (Amide I band) is usually found at a lower frequency, around 1630-1680 cm⁻¹. The observed 1720 cm⁻¹ is too high for a typical amide, making options B and D less likely.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound is likely a primary amine containing a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group. This pattern eliminates option D, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH) group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   The electron-donating group is the amine (-NH₂), and the electron-withdrawing group is the ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Placing these at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** (CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂). This structure has a propionate group. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR spectrum (two N-H bands) and the ¹H NMR (-NH₂ signal at 4.0 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** (H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃). This structure has all the identified features: a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a para-substituted benzene ring. The spectral data aligns perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, which is less likely due to the high C=O frequency in the IR. More importantly, it is a meta-substituted compound, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) seen in the ¹H NMR. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is unequivocally identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
