    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State (at t < 0):**\n    *   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field **B** = B**ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ(**S** ⋅ B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of H₀.\n    *   The operator S_z has two eigenvalues: +ħ/2 (for spin up, |↑⟩) and -ħ/2 (for spin down, |↓⟩).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_↑ = -γB(ħ/2) and E_↓ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_↑.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩, the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian and the State at t > 0:**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ(**S** ⋅ B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n    *   The \"sudden approximation\" in quantum mechanics states that if a Hamiltonian changes instantaneously, the state vector of the system does not have time to change.\n    *   So, the state of the system at t=0+ is still |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩ (the spin-up state in the z-direction).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩ is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H' (since H' depends on S_y, and |↑⟩ is an eigenstate of S_z). Therefore, the state will evolve in time.\n    *   The time evolution of any quantum state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates leads to oscillation in the expectation values of observables. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the populated eigenstates.\n    *   The oscillation angular frequency (ω) is given by the formula: ω = ΔE/ħ, where ΔE is the energy difference between the energy levels of the new Hamiltonian that are populated by the initial state.\n\n4.  **Find the Energy Levels of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is H' = -γBS_y. Its energy levels are the eigenvalues of H'.\n    *   The operator S_y has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, just like S_z.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of H' are:\n        *   E₁ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2\n        *   E₂ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2\n    *   The initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y.

The expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, precesses around the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB. The z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z⟩, will therefore oscillate as cos(ω_L t).

    "This problem describes the quantum mechanical phenomenon of Larmor precession. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle has a spin magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**. It is in a magnetic field **B** = B**ẑ**. The Hamiltonian for this situation is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γBS_z. The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, meaning it is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of S_z are ±ħ/2, so the energy levels are E = -γB(±ħ/2). The lowest energy state (assuming γ > 0) is the \"spin up\" state |↑⟩_z, corresponding to the S_z eigenvalue of +ħ/2. So, the state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change in Hamiltonian (t > 0):** At t=0, the magnetic field is instantaneously switched to **B'** = B**ŷ**. The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y. Due to the \"sudden approximation,\" the state of the system does not have time to change at the instant of the switch. Therefore, the state at t=0+ is still |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.\n\n3.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z is an eigenstate of S_z, but it is *not* an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H, which depends on S_y. When a quantum state is a superposition of different energy eigenstates, the expectation values of observables (like the z-component of the spin) will oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the difference between the energy levels that are populated by the state.\n\n4.  **Energy Levels of the New Hamiltonian:** The new Hamiltonian is H = -γBS_y. Its energy eigenvalues are determined by the eigenvalues of the S_y operator, which are also +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   Energy level 1: E₁ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2\n    *   Energy level 2: E₂ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2\n\n5.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The initial state |↑⟩_z can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y. This means both energy levels, E₁ and E₂, will be populated. The angular frequency (ω) of the oscillation is given by the Bohr frequency condition, which relates the frequency to the energy difference (ΔE) between the populated energy levels:\n    ω = ΔE / ħ\n\n    The energy difference is:\n    ΔE = E₂ - E₁ = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ\n\n    Now, we can find the oscillation frequency:\n    ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nThis frequency, ω = γB, is known as the Larmor frequency. It is the frequency at which the expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the y-axis). Consequently, the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z⟩, and the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩, oscillate at this frequency.\n\nThe provided Python code verifies this exact calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols for the physical quantities.\n# hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2*pi.\n# gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n# B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\nhbar, gamma, B = sympy.symbols('hbar gamma B', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# The new Hamiltonian for t>0 is H = -gamma * B * S_y.\n# The energy levels are the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n# The eigenvalues of the spin operator S_y are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.\n# So, the two energy eigenvalues of H are:\nE1 = -gamma * B * (hbar / 2)\nE2 = -gamma * B * (-hbar / 2)\n\n# The energy difference (gap) between the two states is Delta_E.\nDelta_E = E2 - E1\n\n# The oscillation angular frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition: omega = Delta_E / hbar.\nomega = Delta_E / hbar\n\n# Print the resulting oscillation frequency.\nprint(omega)\n```\nThe code calculates the energy difference between the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian and divides by ħ, which yields the oscillation frequency.
