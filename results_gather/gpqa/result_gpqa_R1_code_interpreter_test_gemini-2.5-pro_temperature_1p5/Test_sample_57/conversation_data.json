    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    1.  **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory (QFT) of the strong interaction. Like other interacting QFTs, calculations of physical quantities often involve integrals over the momenta of virtual particles in loops (Feynman diagrams). These integrals frequently diverge at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). To extract meaningful, finite physical predictions, a procedure involving regularization (to temporarily tame the infinities) and renormalization (to absorb the infinities into a redefinition of the theory's parameters) is required. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n    2.  **B) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be \"UV finite.\" Unlike point-particle theories (like QED and QCD), the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional strings. The interactions between these strings are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances (high energies), which eliminates the ultraviolet divergences found in conventional quantum field theories. Because the theory is believed to be inherently free of these high-energy infinities, it does not require an *ad hoc* regularization procedure.\n    3.  **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, also encounters infinities. The most famous example is the self-energy of a point-like electron. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of an electron assuming it is a point with zero radius, the result is infinite. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the theory by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius, effectively introducing a short-distance cutoff. Therefore, classical electrodynamics does require a form of regularization to handle certain problems.\n    4.  **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where the procedure of regularization and renormalization was successfully developed to handle ultraviolet divergences. Calculations in QED, such as the electron's self-energy or the Lamb shift, lead to infinite results if calculated naively. The methods developed by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga to regularize and renormalize these infinities were a triumph of modern physics. Thus, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the choices provided, Superstring Theory is the only one that is conjectured to be a fundamentally finite theory at high energies, thereby not requiring the procedure of regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
