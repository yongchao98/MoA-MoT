    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n        *   This molecule has one stereocenter at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The stereocenter at C5 is not part of the reaction site and its configuration will remain (S).\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two molecules:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same (S), the other is different (R vs S)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. We can expect two distinct compounds to be formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n        *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   **Transformation:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers.\n        *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's consider the (2R, 4S) structure. Because the molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group, the (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flipped over).\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and the meso compound are diastereomers of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n    *   The final mixture contains all five stereoisomers produced: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n4.  **Analysis by Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral)**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will elute at a different time, giving a **second peak**.\n        *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II products.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds with an ether and an alcohol) are structurally very different from the products from Reaction II (C5 compounds with two alcohols). Therefore, it is safe to assume there will be no accidental co-elution between the two sets of products.\n    *   Total number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Analysis by Chiral HPLC**\n    *   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column will interact differently with each of these five distinct molecules. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved. The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved. The meso compound from Reaction II is a unique stereoisomer and will also have its own retention time, different from the others.\n    *   Therefore, we expect to see **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4.\n    *   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
