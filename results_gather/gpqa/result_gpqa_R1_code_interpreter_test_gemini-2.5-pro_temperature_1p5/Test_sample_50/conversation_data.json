    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. Since the charge is outside the sphere, we know that `d > R`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Appropriate Method:** This electrostatic problem is best solved using the \"Method of Images\". This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the real system and the image system.\n\n3.  **Define the Image System:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image system that reproduces the same electric field outside the sphere consists of:\n    *   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n    *   An image charge `q'` placed inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n    This specific choice of `q'` and `b` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` at any point is due to the induced charges on the sphere. In our image system, this force is simply the attractive Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method A: Integrating the Force**\n    The work done `W` by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` is the negative of the work done by the electric field. This work is stored as potential energy `U`.\n    `U = W = ∫_∞^d F_external ⋅ dr = - ∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dr`\n    The electric force on charge `q` when it is at a variable position `x` from the center is the force from its image:\n    *   Image charge at this position `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n    *   Image position: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`\n    *   Force: `F_electric(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The potential energy is the integral of this force from `d` to `∞`:\n    `U = ∫_d^∞ F_electric(x) dx = ∫_d^∞ [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    This integral evaluates to:\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `d` to `∞`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula `U = (1/2)qV`**\n    A more direct method is to calculate the energy as half the product of the charge and the potential it experiences due to all other charges.\n    *   The total energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`.\n    *   The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere` is 0. The second term vanishes.\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `q` due to `q'` is: `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q^2 * R / (d(d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)`\n    B) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)`\n    C) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)`\n    D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our result matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
