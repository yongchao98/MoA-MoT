    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An absorption peak for an ester group (–COO–) is present. An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). Having only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a para (1,4) substitution. This would give two sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This specific splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n            *   Let's label the group as `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to the adjacent proton H(b), so its signal is a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This group also provides one of the two methyl signals.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one methyl group from the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out many common alkyl groups like ethyl (–CH2CH3) or propyl (–CH2CH2CH3). For the ester group, it rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Piece together the molecular structure:**\n    *   **Core:** A para-substituted benzene ring (p-C6H4).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group and no methylene (–CH2–) group. The two possibilities are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: –COOCH3\n        *   An acetoxy group: –O–CO–CH3\n    *   Both possibilities fit the given data. Let's build a potential structure: methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. The other possibility is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Determine the chemical formula from the deduced structure:**\n    Let's sum the atoms for the identified fragments:\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent (either –COOCH3 or –OOCCH3): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (DBE=4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (DBE=1) + 1 ester C=O bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE = 6**.\n    *   **From the formula C11H12O2:** Using the formula DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), we get DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DBE from the structure and the formula match, confirming our deduction.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each option to see which ones are plausible. The correct formula must have a DBE of 6.\n    \n    ```python\n    def calculate_dbe(C, H):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the degrees of unsaturation.\"\"\"\n        return C - H/2 + 1\n\n    # DBE for the proposed structure is 6 (ring=4, C=C=1, C=O=1)\n    print(f\"The DBE required by the spectral data is 6.\")\n\n    # Option A: C11H14O2\n    dbe_A = calculate_dbe(11, 14)\n    print(f\"Option A (C11H14O2) has DBE = {dbe_A}\")\n\n    # Option B: C12H12O2\n    dbe_B = calculate_dbe(12, 12)\n    print(f\"Option B (C12H12O2) has DBE = {dbe_B}\")\n\n    # Option C: C12H14O2\n    dbe_C = calculate_dbe(12, 14)\n    print(f\"Option C (C12H14O2) has DBE = {dbe_C}\")\n\n    # Option D: C11H12O2\n    dbe_D = calculate_dbe(11, 12)\n    print(f\"Option D (C11H12O2) has DBE = {dbe_D}\")\n    ```\n\n    *   The DBE for C11H14O2 is 5. This is incorrect.\n    *   The DBE for C12H12O2 is 7. This is incorrect.\n    *   The DBE for C12H14O2 is 6. This is plausible based on DBE alone.\n    *   The DBE for C11H12O2 is 6. This is plausible based on DBE alone.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    We must choose between C11H12O2 (Option D) and C12H14O2 (Option C). Our detailed structural analysis based on the NMR splitting patterns led directly to the formula C11H12O2. It is not possible to construct a C12H14O2 molecule that fits all the specific constraints (especially the propenyl splitting pattern and the absence of –CH2– signals). Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
