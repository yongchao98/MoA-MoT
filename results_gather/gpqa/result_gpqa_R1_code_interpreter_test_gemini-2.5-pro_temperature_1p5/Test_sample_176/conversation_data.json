    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L₁ / L₂`).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n*   **Luminosity of a Black Body (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. The total luminosity (L) is given by:\n    `L = A * σ * T⁴ = 4πR²σT⁴`\n    where `R` is the star's radius, `T` is its surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body (Wien's Displacement Law):** The wavelength at which a black body radiates most intensely (`λ_emitted_max`) is inversely proportional to its temperature:\n    `λ_emitted_max = b / T`\n    where `b` is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted in the source's rest frame (`λ_emitted`). For a source moving with a radial velocity `v_r` (positive for recession, negative for approach), the non-relativistic approximation (since `v_r << c`) is:\n    `λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, the ratio of their luminosities is:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)`\nThe constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Find the Ratios:**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore:\n    `(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    a. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_obs_max_2`.\n    b. Let's relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect:\n        - For Star_1, `v_r1 = 0`. So, `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_emitted_max_1`.\n        - For Star_2, `v_r2 = 700 km/s`. The wavelength is redshifted. So, `λ_obs_max_2 = λ_emitted_max_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    c. Since `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_obs_max_2`:\n        `λ_emitted_max_1 = λ_emitted_max_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n    d. Now, use Wien's Law (`T = b / λ_emitted_max`) to find the temperature ratio:\n        `T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emitted_max_1) / (b / λ_emitted_max_2)`\n        `T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_max_2 / λ_emitted_max_1`\n    e. From step (c), we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        `λ_emitted_max_2 / λ_emitted_max_1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n    f. Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        `T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\n**5. Combine the Ratios and Calculate the Final Value:**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)]⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)⁴`\n\nNow, we need to plug in the values and compute the result. This is best done with a short script for precision.\n\n**Variables:**\n*   `v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n*   `c = 299,792,458 m/s` (speed of light)\n*   Radius ratio squared = `2.25`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000\n\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n\n# Ratio of radii squared\nradius_ratio_sq = 1.5**2\n\n# Calculate the term (1 + v_r2/c)^4\ndoppler_factor_pow4 = (1 + v_r2 / c)**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_sq / doppler_factor_pow4\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.23\n>>>\n\nThe calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. The mass information was extraneous to this particular calculation.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the luminosity of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n- R is the star's radius.\n- T is the star's effective surface temperature.\n- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\nTherefore, the ratio of their radii is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\nSquaring this gives:\n(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most involved part of the calculation. We need to relate temperature to the observed peak wavelength.\n\n1.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted_max):\n    λ_emitted_max = b / T  or  T = b / λ_emitted_max\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n    The ratio of the temperatures is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁\n\n2.  **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength we *observe* (λ_observed_max) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v_r). The relationship is given by:\n    λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive v_r indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n3.  **Connecting the Concepts:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:\n    λ_observed_max,₁ = λ_observed_max,₂\n\n    Let's apply the Doppler effect to each star:\n    -   **Star_1:** v_r,₁ = 0. So, λ_observed_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted_max,₁.\n    -   **Star_2:** v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_observed_max,₂ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂ / c).\n\n    Since the observed wavelengths are equal:\n    λ_emitted_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\n    Substituting this back into our temperature ratio expression from point 1:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio\nNow we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into our main luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂ / c)⁴\n\nLet's plug in the numerical values:\n- v_r,₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n- c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nThe calculation can be performed precisely using a script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n# Square of the radius ratio\nradius_ratio_squared = 1.5**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator term (relativistic factor for temperature, to the power of 4)\ndenominator = (1 + v_r2 / c)**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_squared / denominator\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.23\n>>>The computed factor is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars was not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The ratio of the luminosities of two stars radiating as black bodies is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\nWe need to determine the ratios (R₁ / R₂) and (T₁ / T₂).\n\n**1. Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio**\nThe temperature is related to the peak emission wavelength by Wien's Displacement Law:\nT = b / λ_emitted_max\nwhere 'b' is a constant and λ_emitted_max is the wavelength emitted by the star at its rest frame.\nThe ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emitted_max,₁) / (b / λ_emitted_max,₂) = λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂).
