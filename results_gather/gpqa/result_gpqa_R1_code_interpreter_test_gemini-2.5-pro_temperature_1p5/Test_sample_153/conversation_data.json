    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak). The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes being roughly 3:1).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options. All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for this formula (using ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope. So, the mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring, as found in a benzoic acid derivative.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence favors options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and rules out option B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acyl chloride) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol and an aldehyde group).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The signal is a singlet ('s') because this proton typically does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A and C.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H)\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on each side of the ring are identical, and each has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in a doublet.\n    *   Let's compare this with our remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would give a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. It has two sets of equivalent protons: the two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom. This substitution pattern perfectly explains the observed 'two doublets of 2H each' splitting pattern. The more electron-withdrawing carboxyl group deshields the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly upfield (at 7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm the carboxylic acid functional group. The splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the 1,4-(para) substitution on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>"
