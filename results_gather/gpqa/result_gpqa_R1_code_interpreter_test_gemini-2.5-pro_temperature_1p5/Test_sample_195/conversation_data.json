    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. In this case, the system is the mass under the influence of the spring force. The total energy `E_{total}` is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy (`KE`) and the potential energy (`PE`).\n    `E_{total} = KE + PE = constant`\n\n2.  **Define the energy components.**\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (KE):** The kinetic energy of a particle with mass `m` moving at speed `v` is given by `KE = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   **Potential Energy (PE):** The potential energy of a spring that obeys Hooke's law (`F = -kx`) is `PE = (1/2)kx²`, where `x` is the displacement from the equilibrium position. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points in the oscillation.**\n    The total energy must be the same at every point in the motion. We can find the value of the total energy at a point where the calculation is simple, and then use that value to find the unknown `v_{max}` at another point.\n\n    *   **Point 1: At maximum displacement (amplitude A).**\n        When the mass is at its maximum displacement `x = A`, it momentarily comes to a stop.\n        *   Speed `v = 0`.\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n        *   Kinetic energy `KE = (1 - 1)mc² = 0`.\n        *   Potential energy `PE = (1/2)kA²`.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is `E_{total} = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`.\n\n    *   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0).**\n        When the mass passes through the equilibrium position `x = 0`, the net force on it is zero, and its speed is at its maximum value, `v = v_{max}`.\n        *   Displacement `x = 0`.\n        *   Potential energy `PE = (1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n        *   The speed is `v_{max}`, so the Lorentz factor is `γ_{max} = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_{max}²/c²)`.\n        *   The kinetic energy is `KE = (γ_{max} - 1)mc²`.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy at this point is `E_{total} = (γ_{max} - 1)mc² + 0`.\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy expressions from the two points.**\n    Since total energy is conserved, we can set the two expressions for `E_{total}` equal to each other:\n    `E_{total}` (at x=A) = `E_{total}` (at x=0)\n    `(1/2)kA² = (γ_{max} - 1)mc²`\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, `v_{max}`.**\n    First, we solve the equation for `γ_{max}`:\n    `γ_{max} - 1 = (1/2)kA² / (mc²) = kA² / (2mc²)`\n    `γ_{max} = 1 + kA² / (2mc²)`\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of `γ_{max}`:\n    `1 / sqrt(1 - v_{max}²/c²) = 1 + kA² / (2mc²)`\n\n    To solve for `v_{max}`, we rearrange the equation. First, invert both sides:\n    `sqrt(1 - v_{max}²/c²) = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))`\n\n    Square both sides:\n    `1 - v_{max}²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    Isolate the `v_{max}²/c²` term:\n    `v_{max}²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    Finally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_{max}`:\n    `v_{max} = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²)`\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for `v_{max}` is identical to option A.\n\n    `v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n<<<A>>>"
