    "This phrase is a common piece of jargon in a synthetic organic chemistry lab and it almost always refers to a separation technique, most commonly chromatography.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** Synthetic organic chemists spend a great deal of time purifying the compounds they make. A very common purification technique is **column chromatography**, which separates compounds based on their differential interactions with a stationary phase (often polar silica gel) and a mobile phase (a less polar solvent or solvent mixture called the eluent). A quick analytical version of this is **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**, which is used to monitor the progress of a reaction and determine the right solvent conditions for a column.\n\n2.  **Interpret the phrase:** When a chemist runs a TLC, they spot their mixture on a plate, and as the solvent moves up the plate, the compounds in the mixture separate into distinct spots. The position of a spot is determined by the compound's polarity. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate up the TLC plate, and their spots will appear at the same height, i.e., \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that separating them using column chromatography will be very difficult or impossible with that particular solvent system. The chemist's comment, \"my compounds are on top of each other,\" is a direct reference to this visual result on a TLC plate, which signifies a failed or difficult separation.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would make them difficult to separate by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is not typically used for distillation. One would more likely say \"they co-distill.\"\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a physical property used for characterization, not separation. While enantiomers are difficult to separate, this phrase doesn't refer to the property of optical rotation itself.\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the correct answer. As explained above, similar polarity is the direct cause for compounds to not separate during normal-phase chromatography, leading to spots that are \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate.\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While these forces are present, the challenge in separation arises from the compounds having similar *interactions with the stationary and mobile phases*, not necessarily with each other. The root cause of these similar interactions is their similar polarity.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely complaining that a chromatographic separation has failed because the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
