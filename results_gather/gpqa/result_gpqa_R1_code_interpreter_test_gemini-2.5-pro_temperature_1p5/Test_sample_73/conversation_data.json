    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: Radioactive decay is a random process. For a single unstable nucleus, the probability of it decaying in any given time interval is constant, regardless of how long it has already existed. This is known as the **memoryless property**, and it is characteristic of the exponential distribution.\n\n2.  **Mathematical Model**: We can model the time `T` until the atom decays using an exponential probability distribution.\n    *   The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., it survives past `t`) is given by the survival function: `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function: `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**: We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   Using the formula: `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   Rearranging the equation to find the survival probability at 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically**: We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   This is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)` which simplifies to `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n    *   This means we just need to calculate the probability that a \"fresh\" atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability**: We need to find `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in step 3:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = 0.68^1.5`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n        `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value**: We will use a simple Python script to calculate `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, we have the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n# P_survival_100 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# This corresponds to exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to\n# finding the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in 150 mins) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of exp(-lambda * 100):\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# P_survival_150 = P_survival_100 ** 1.5\np_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival.\np_decay_150 = 1 - p_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {p_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n> EXECUTED_CODE_OUTPUT:\n> The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: 43.93%\n\nThe calculation shows the probability is approximately 43.93%.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the core principle:** The problem deals with radioactive decay, which is a random, memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Define the decay model:** The probability of an atom surviving past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of it decaying by time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the given data to find the survival rate:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of *surviving* for 100 minutes is:\n        `S(100) = P(T > 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   So, we have the relationship: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the question:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n    *   This is the conditional probability `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, this is equal to the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes: `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the required probability:** We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to the value we found in step 3:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n        `S(150) = 0.68^1.5`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the decay probability:\n        `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n6.  **Compute the numerical value:** We'll use Python to get a precise value for this expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n# This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is P(T > 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# S(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# The process is memoryless.

    "The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already existed.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Survival and Decay Probabilities**\n\n*   Let `T` be the random variable for the time until the atom decays.\n*   The survival function, the probability that the atom survives past time `t`, is `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   The decay probability, the probability that the atom decays by time `t`, is `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Given Information to Characterize the Decay**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n*   This implies the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `P(T > 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n*   From our formula, `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Question Using the Memoryless Property**\n\nWe are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed do not affect the future probability.\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\nSo, we simply need to calculate the probability that a \"fresh\" atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n*   We know `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`.\n*   We can use the value we found in Step 2 to solve for this:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we calculate the decay probability:\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Percentage and Choose the Answer**\n\nThe probability of decay is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
