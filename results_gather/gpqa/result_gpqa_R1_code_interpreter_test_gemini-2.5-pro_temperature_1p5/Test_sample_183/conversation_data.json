    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern and the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1:** A strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position 2:** A weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3:** A strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern requires careful strategic planning, often involving blocking groups, to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's evaluate each option step by step, considering the major products and standard reaction mechanisms.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is bulky, so nitration yields predominantly the *para* product, 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group gives 4-tert-butylaniline.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs the new -NO2 group *ortho* to itself, yielding 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group gives the corresponding diazonium salt.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces -N2+ with -OH, yielding 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the -OH to -OEt, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\nThis final product has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is the wrong isomer. The last two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are pointless. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct the incoming -SO3H group to the same position (position 2 relative to nitro). This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is for diazotization, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The substrate at this stage has no amino group. Therefore, this reaction step is impossible as written. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction → Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic and not \"high-yield\". The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, shutting down the desired alkylation. Furthermore, N-alkylation and polyalkylation are common side reactions. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option utilizes a blocking group strategy, which is the key to achieving this type of substitution pattern. Let's analyze the sequence.\n\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. To minimize steric hindrance, the -SO3H group adds to the *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Now, the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -SO3H group (m-directing) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2 (and 6). This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the -NO2 group to an -NH2 group gives **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nAt this point, the sequence becomes problematic as written:\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. This reaction is performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C) as diazonium salts are unstable.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of the diazonium salt. This is highly unusual and problematic. Diazonium salts readily decompose, and subjecting one to harsh nitrating conditions is not a standard synthetic step.\n\nHowever, there is likely a typo in the question, and steps (v) and (vi) are swapped. Let's analyze the sequence with the corrected order (vi then v):\nvi') `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration) of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. In acidic solution, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is meta-directing. However, there is an equilibrium, and the unprotonated -NH2 group is a powerful ortho-, para-director. Let's assume conditions are chosen to allow the -NH2 group to direct the substitution. The directing groups are -NH2 (at 2, o,p-director), -tBu (at 4, o,p-director), and -SO3H (at 1, m-director). All three groups direct the incoming electrophile to positions 3 and 5. For the desired product, we need nitration at position 3. While position 5 is sterically more accessible, let's assume conditions can favor position 3, yielding **3-nitro-2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nv') `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization) of the amino group.\nvii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to give **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\nviii) `dilute H2SO4`: Heating with dilute acid causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H blocking group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol (-OH) to an ethoxy ether (-OEt). This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis logically constructed pathway, which uses all the reagents from Option C, successfully synthesizes the target molecule. Since options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed, Option C, despite the likely typo in the order of steps v and vi, is the only plausible choice as it outlines the correct overall strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
