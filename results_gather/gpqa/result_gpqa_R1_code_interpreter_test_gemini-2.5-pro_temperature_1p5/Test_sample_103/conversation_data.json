    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (T₂ / T₁).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Information:**\n    *   Two stars with identical masses: M_s1 = M_s2 = M_s.\n    *   Two planets with identical masses: m_p1 = m_p2 = m_p.\n    *   Both orbits are circular.\n    *   The detection method is Radial Velocity (RV).\n    *   The observable is the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n        *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n        *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n3.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    The RV method uses the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the star's velocity along the line of sight (v_r).\n    \n    `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`\n    \n    Where `λ` is the rest wavelength and `c` is the speed of light.\n    \n    The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the semi-amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as `K`.\n    \n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\n    `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    \n    We can write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 7 / 5`\n\n4.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude `K` is given by:\n    \n    `K = (m_p * sin(i) / (M_s + m_p)) * v_orbit`\n    where `v_orbit = sqrt(G * (M_s + m_p) / a)` is the orbital velocity of the planet-star system around the barycenter, `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit), `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    A simpler, more common form, especially when `m_p << M_s`, is:\n    `K ≈ (m_p * sin(i) / M_s) * sqrt(G * M_s / a)`\n    \n    This can be simplified to:\n    `K ≈ (m_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G) / sqrt(M_s)) * (1 / sqrt(a))`\n\n    We are given that `M_s1 = M_s2` and `m_p1 = m_p2`. The problem doesn't provide information about the orbital inclinations `i₁` and `i₂`. For such a problem with a single expected answer, we must assume that the inclinations are the same (`i₁ = i₂`). With this standard assumption, all the terms in the parenthesis are constant for both systems.\n    \n    Thus, the semi-amplitude `K` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(a)`.\n    `K ∝ a⁻¹/²`\n\n    Now we can relate the ratios of `K` and `a`:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (a₂ / a₁)⁻¹/² = (a₁ / a₂)¹/² = sqrt(a₁ / a₂)`\n    \n    We already found `K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5`, so:\n    `7 / 5 = sqrt(a₁ / a₂)`\n    \n    Squaring both sides gives the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a₁ / a₂ = (7 / 5)² = 49 / 25`\n    \n    Or, inversely:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49`\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Period (T) to Semi-Major Axis (a):**\n    We use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\n    `T² = (4π² / (G * (M_s + m_p))) * a³`\n\n    Since both stars have the same mass (`M_s`) and both planets have the same mass (`m_p`), the term `(4π² / (G * (M_s + m_p)))` is a constant for both systems.\n    \n    Therefore, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    `T² ∝ a³` or `T ∝ a³/²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Relationships to Find the Final Answer:**\n    We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. Using the proportionality `T ∝ a³/²`, we can write:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)³/²`\n\n    From step 4, we know `a₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49`. Substituting this into the equation:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = (25 / 49)³/²`\n    \n    We can solve this by taking the square root first, then cubing the result:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = (sqrt(25 / 49))³ = (5 / 7)³`\n    \n    `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Now, we perform the final calculation. A simple python script can compute the value.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods T2/T1 is (5/7)^3.\nresult = (5/7)**3\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is approximately `0.3644`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value `0.3644` is very close to `0.36`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe reasoning leads to the conclusion that the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (T₂ / T₁).\n\n**Step 1: Relate the observed wavelength shift to the star's radial velocity.**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the change in a star's velocity along our line of sight caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The Doppler effect relates the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) to this radial velocity (v_r):\nΔλ / λ = v_r / c\nwhere λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the RV semi-amplitude, K. Therefore, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\nWe are given:\nΔλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\nΔλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n**Step 2: Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital parameters.**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by the formula:\nK = (mₚ * sin(i) / Mₛ) * √(G * Mₛ / a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛ is the star's mass, a is the semi-major axis (the orbital radius for a circular orbit), i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that the stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂), and the planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). Since the problem provides a single numerical answer, we must assume that other unknown factors, like the orbital inclination (i), are the same for both systems. With these assumptions, the term (mₚ * sin(i) / Mₛ) * √(G * Mₛ) is constant for both systems.\n\nTherefore, K is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a):\nK ∝ 1 / √a\n\nWe can write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes in terms of the semi-major axes:\nK₂ / K₁ = √(a₁) / √(a₂) = √(a₁ / a₂)\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n7 / 5 = √(a₁ / a₂)\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n(7 / 5)² = a₁ / a₂\n49 / 25 = a₁ / a₂\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axis of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is:\na₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49\n\n**Step 4: Use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a).**\n\nKepler's Third Law states:\nT² ∝ a³ / (Mₛ + mₚ)\n\nSince the mass of the star (Mₛ) and the mass of the planet (mₚ) are the same for both systems, the term (Mₛ + mₚ) is constant. Therefore, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\nT² ∝ a³  or  T ∝ a^(3/2)\n\nThe ratio of the orbital periods is:\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods.**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁ = 25 / 49) into the equation from Step 4:\nT₂ / T₁ = (25 / 49)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (√(25 / 49))³\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is closest to 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>"
