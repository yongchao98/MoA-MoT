    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from our perspective.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative speed between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* (often denoted as `Δτ` or `Δt₀`) because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The speed `v` is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`), so we must account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation.\n    *   Time dilation describes how time measured in a stationary frame (S) is longer than the time measured in a moving frame (S'). The formula is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get the numerical answer, we can execute a simple calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Speed of ejecta in km/s\nv = 60000.0\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 300000.0\n# Proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\ndt_prime = 50.0\n\n# The classical distance, ignoring relativity\nclassical_distance = v * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\nrelativistic_distance = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{relativistic_distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\nThe computed distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the option value.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. We are given the time elapsed in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the moving ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal**\nWe need to calculate the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000/300,000 = 0.2`), the time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame (`Δt`) will be different from the time measured in the moving ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nWhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)²) `\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)`\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s`\n    `Δt ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`. Let's look at the options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\nThe calculation was confirmed by the Python script, which yielded an output of `3061862`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
