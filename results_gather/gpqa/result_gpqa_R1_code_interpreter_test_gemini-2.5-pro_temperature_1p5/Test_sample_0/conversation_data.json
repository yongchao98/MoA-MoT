    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The problem involves distinguishing two quantum energy levels. Quantum states with finite lifetimes do not have perfectly defined energies. This is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\n    Here, ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The energy of an unstable state is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE, often called the natural linewidth or energy width. For a state with a lifetime τ, we can approximate Δt ≈ τ, and the energy width (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM) is given by:\n    ΔE = Γ = ħ / τ\n\n2.  **Define the Resolvability Criterion:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be large enough compared to their energy widths, ΔE1 and ΔE2. A common and reasonable criterion is that the energy separation must be at least on the order of, or greater than, the sum of their energy widths.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n    The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width and will be the primary factor limiting resolvability.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information and Constants:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   For the first state:\n        ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state:\n        ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    According to our criterion, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    |E1 - E2| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    |E1 - E2| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    |E1 - E2| > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We now check which of the provided options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV. This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    Only option C provides an energy separation that is large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the combined energy widths of the states.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width (ΔE = ħ/τ) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be\n# greater than their combined energy widths.\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (τ=1e-9 s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (τ=1e-8 s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy separation > {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\n# Find the suitable option\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV is large enough for the levels to be resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV is too small for the levels to be resolved.\")\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (τ=1e-9 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (τ=1e-8 s): 6.582e-08 eV\nRequired energy separation > 7.240e-07 eV\n\nComparing with the options:\nOption A: 1.0e-08 eV is too small for the levels to be resolved.\nOption B: 1.0e-09 eV is too small for the levels to be resolved.\nOption C: 1.0e-04 eV is large enough for the levels to be resolved.\nOption D: 1.0e-11 eV is too small for the levels to be resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem requires us to determine the minimum energy difference needed to distinguish two quantum states with finite lifetimes. This is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle.\n\n**1. The Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that for a quantum state with a lifetime Δt (in this case, τ), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy, ΔE, given by the relation:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor practical purposes, the energy width (Γ) is often approximated as:\nΓ = ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\nWe are given the lifetimes for the two states:\n*   State 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   State 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n*   ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. The Condition for Resolvability:**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. A conservative criterion is that the energy separation should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\nUsing the values calculated in step 2:\nMinimum separation > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nMinimum separation > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\nMinimum separation > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options:**\nWe need to find an option for the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is significantly greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much larger than the required separation.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than the required separation.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough for the two energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>"
