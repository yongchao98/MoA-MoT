    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Conclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This tells us the molecule is saturated, meaning it contains no C=C or C≡C bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids.\n        *   \"One of the signals...is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a highly specific splitting pattern. For a proton to show this multiplicity, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   One single proton (which splits the signal into a **d**oublet).\n            *   A set of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n            *   A set of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n        *   \"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": Similarly, this proton must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n            *   One single proton (giving a **d**oublet).\n            *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group, giving a **t**riplet).\n            *   Another, chemically different set of two equivalent protons (another CH₂ group, giving a second **t**riplet).\n\n2.  **Systematically Analyze Each Candidate Structure:**\n    The most effective method is to draw each structure and examine the environments of the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have such complex splitting. We will number the carbons starting from the COOH group as C1. The ethyl group (C₂H₅) is -CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n        *   **Proton at C3 (H₃):** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H → d), the CH₂ at C4 (2H → t), and the C3-methyl group (3H → q). This gives a **dtq** (or dqt).\n        *   **Proton at C2 (H₂):** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H → d) and the C2-methyl group (3H → q). This gives a dq.\n        *   *Result:* This molecule has a `dtq` signal but no `dtt` signal. It is not the correct compound.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   **Proton at C3 (H₃):** Is coupled to H at C4 (1H → d), the CH₂ at C2 (2H → t), and the C3-methyl group (3H → q). This gives a **dtq**.\n        *   **Proton at C4 (H₄):** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H → d), the methyl at C5 (3H → q), and the C4-methyl group (3H → q). This gives a dqq (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n        *   *Result:* This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(2)(C₂H₅)-COOH(1)`\n        *   **Proton at C3 (H₃):** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H → d), the CH₂ at C4 (2H → t), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C3 (2H → t). This gives a **dtt**.\n        *   **Proton at C2 (H₂):** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H → d) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C2 (2H → t). This gives a dt.\n        *   *Result:* This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Let's analyze the two methine protons, H3 and H4.\n        *   **Proton at C4 (H₄):** It is adjacent to three different proton environments.\n            1.  The single proton on C3 (1H) will split its signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  The two protons of the CH₂ part of its own ethyl group (-**CH₂**CH₃ at C4) will split its signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The three protons of the CH₃ group at C5 will split its signal into a **quartet**.\n            *   Combining these gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the experimental signals.\n        *   **Proton at C3 (H₃):** It is also adjacent to three different proton environments.\n            1.  The single proton on C4 (1H) will split its signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 will split its signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The two protons of the CH₂ part of its own ethyl group (-**CH₂**CH₃ at C3) will split its signal into another **triplet**.\n            *   Combining these gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other experimental signal.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Molecule B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only structure that can produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, which perfectly matches the data provided.\n\n<<<B>>>"
