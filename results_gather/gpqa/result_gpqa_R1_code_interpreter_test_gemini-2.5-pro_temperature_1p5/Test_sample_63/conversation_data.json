    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, followed by a chemical analysis of the gaseous products. Let's break down the analysis steps:\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Equimolar mixture of salts A and B.\n    *   Total mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   Heating to 200°C without air results in only gaseous products (no solid residue).\n\n*   **Gas Analysis Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol H₂O.\n\n*   **Gas Analysis Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):**\n    *   This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a critical clue: **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Gas Analysis Tube №3 (red-hot copper):**\n    *   Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas supplied oxygen to the copper.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with Cu.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol O.\n    *   The gas reacting here cannot be H₂O (removed in Tube 1) or an acidic gas (absent). Common possibilities are O₂, N₂O, or NO.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all previous reagents (H₂O absorber, limewater, hot copper). The most likely candidate is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Formulate and Test a Hypothesis for the Salts**\n\nBased on the products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxide of nitrogen or oxygen itself) and the fact that the starting materials are salts that decompose completely into gases, a strong hypothesis is that we are dealing with ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Let's assume the two salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n    *   Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₂):  NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₃):  NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *(Note: N₂O is a gas that reacts with hot copper: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂)*\n\n*   **Test the Hypothesis:** The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n\n    *   **From the reactions:**\n        *   Total moles of H₂O produced = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n.\n        *   Moles of N₂ produced = n (from A).\n        *   Moles of N₂O produced = n (from B).\n\n    *   **Compare with experimental data:**\n        *   We found that 0.2 mol of H₂O was produced. So, 4n = 0.2 mol, which means **n = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   This means the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n    *   **Verify the other products:**\n        *   **Tube 3 (N₂O reaction):** According to our hypothesis, n = 0.05 mol of N₂O was produced. When this reacts with hot copper (N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂), it provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n            *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 0.80 g. This exactly matches the weight gain of Tube №3. The hypothesis holds.\n        *   **Gas C (N₂):** The final gas is N₂. It comes from two sources: the initial decomposition of NH₄NO₂ and the reduction of N₂O in Tube 3.\n            *   N₂ from NH₄NO₂ = n = 0.05 mol.\n            *   N₂ from N₂O reduction = n = 0.05 mol.\n            *   Total moles of N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This exactly matches the moles of Gas C calculated from the volume. The hypothesis holds.\n\n    *   **Verify the initial mass:**\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.04 g/mol.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80.04 g/mol.\n        *   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol)\n        *   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\nThe hypothesis is fully consistent with all pieces of information provided. The salts A and B are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" Given the multiple-choice answers, this refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula of one unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA python script can be used to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Constants and Molar Masses\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 16.00     # g/mol\nV_m_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\nM_NH4NO2 = 14.007*2 + 1.008*4 + 15.999*2 # approx 64.04 g/mol\nM_NH4NO3 = 14.007*2 + 1.008*4 + 15.999*3 # approx 80.04 g/mol\n\n# Experimental Data\nmass_H2O = 3.60\nmass_O_gain = 0.80\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24\ninitial_mass = 7.20\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Moles of H2O from Tube 1\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\n\n# Based on hypothesis (NH4NO2 and NH4NO3), moles H2O = 4n\nn = moles_H2O / 4\n\n# --- Verification ---\n# Check mass gain in Tube 3 (from n moles of N2O)\ncalculated_mass_O_gain = n * M_O\n\n# Check volume of Gas C (from n moles of N2 + n moles of N2 from N2O reduction)\ncalculated_volume_gas_C = (2 * n) * V_m_STP\n\n# Check total initial mass\ncalculated_initial_mass = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\n\n# --- Final Answer Calculation ---\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 2  # NH4NO2\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 3  # NH4NO3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Moles of each salt (n): {n:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"VERIFICATION:\")\nprint(f\"  Calculated O mass gain: {calculated_mass_O_gain:.2f} g (vs. Given {mass_O_gain:.2f} g)\")\nprint(f\"  Calculated Gas C volume: {calculated_volume_gas_C:.2f} L (vs. Given {volume_gas_C:.2f} L)\")\nprint(f\"  Calculated initial mass: {calculated_initial_mass:.2f} g (vs. Given {initial_mass:.2f} g)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Total atoms in NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 formulas: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations have been successfully validated by the code execution.\n\n1.  **Identify Products from Experimental Data:**\n    *   Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass gain = 3.60 g. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂): No weight change implies no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were formed.\n    *   Tube 3 (Hot Copper): Hot Cu reacts with an oxidizing gas, and CuO is formed. The weight gain of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. The gas supplying the oxygen is likely a nitrogen oxide, as water has already been removed.\n    *   Remaining Gas (C): Volume = 2.24 L at STP. Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is inert to all previous reagents, suggesting it is N₂.\n\n2.  **Hypothesize Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxide of nitrogen) and the complete decomposition into gases strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   A: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   B: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The N₂O gas from salt B would then react with the hot copper in tube №3:\n        *   N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction supplies the oxygen atoms detected.\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Total moles of H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n.\n        *   From our data, moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol. So, 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Now, let's check the other products with n = 0.05 mol.\n        *   **Tube 3:** Salt B produces 'n' moles of N₂O. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. This provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. Mass of O = 0.05 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g. This matches the experimental data.\n        *   **Gas C (N₂):** The final N₂ gas comes from two sources: the decomposition of salt A ('n' moles) and the reduction of N₂O ('n' moles). Total N₂ = n + n = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental data for gas C.\n        *   **Initial Mass:** Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt is 7.20 g.\n            *   Mass of NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass ≈ 64 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n            *   Mass of NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 80 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n            *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂: 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃: 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
