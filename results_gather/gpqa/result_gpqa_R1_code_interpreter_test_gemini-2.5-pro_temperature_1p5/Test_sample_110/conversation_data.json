    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base. Its role is to deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone will be deprotonated to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which will be attacked by the enolate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group C=O): C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n        *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position. This forms a single regioisomer of the enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, the intermediate enolate is protonated during workup to yield the final product. The ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` chain.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...substituent...)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered as C1'. To give the principal group on the ring (the keto group) the lowest possible number, we number the ring such that the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   **Attachment point (original C6)** becomes **C1'**. It has a methyl group (`1-methyl`).\n        *   **Carbonyl carbon (original C1)** becomes **C2'** (`2-oxo`).\n        *   **Original C2** becomes **C3'**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these parts alphabetically gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and D, and rules out options B and C.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the carbon α to the nitro group.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group. The α-carbon in 1-nitropropane has two acidic protons.\n    *   The nucleophile is the nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. For CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN, the attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is 6 carbons long. So the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n        `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n    *   We identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group at C3 (`3-methyl`).\n        *   A nitro group at C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   Combining the names alphabetically gives: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This is the name for product **B**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options C and D, and rules out options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two correct products leads to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
