    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The standard formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to calculate the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Let's write it out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). This allows for significant simplification:\n    *   $T_{star}$ cancels out.\n    *   $R_{star}$ cancels out.\n    *   The factor of 2 cancels out.\n    *   The term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ cancels out.\n\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This is a key insight: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Find the Semi-Major Axis (a):** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the wobble of the star, which is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the orbital distance ($a$). The formula for the star's maximum radial velocity ($K$) for a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   Since the planets were also detected by the transit method, the inclination `i` must be close to 90°, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This allows us to use the planets' true masses given in the problem.\n\n6.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** I need to find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. I can rearrange the formula for $K$ to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*} \\frac{G}{a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_* \\cdot K^2}$\n\n7.  **Form the Ratio for Semi-Major Axes:** Now I can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_* \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_* \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\n    The gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{earth}$\n        $M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{earth}$\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n    *   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K):** The velocity amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, since $K = c \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03 \\, Å$\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04 \\, Å$\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** Now substitute the component ratios back into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Finally, substitute the value of $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:** I will use a calculator to find the decimal value of 15/28.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# Mp2/Mp1 = 5/7\n# K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\nk_ratio_1_over_2 = 3 / 4\n\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (k_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = a_ratio_2_over_1**0.5\n\nprint(temp_ratio_1_over_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the numerical value is approximately 0.5357. This value is very close to 0.53, which is option C. The extraneous information (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) was not needed for the final ratio calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} (1 - A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also specifies that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$). We can determine this from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum radial velocity ($K$) of the star caused by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and i is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected via the transit method, the inclination $i$ is very close to 90°, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}} \\implies a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_{p1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\n\nThe terms G and $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\nThe maximum radial velocity K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nWe are given:\n- $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n- $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03 Å$\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04 Å$\n\nLet's calculate the ratios:\n- $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^2 (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
