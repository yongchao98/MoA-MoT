    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which compounds are chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Such molecules will rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, methyl C, ethyl C) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule. The molecule has no chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (`3aR`, `7aS`) and for the double bond (`E`). When a compound is named with specific R/S descriptors for its stereocenters, it refers to a single enantiomer (or a single diastereomer if multiple exist). A pure sample of a single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on C2 are the same as the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When such a molecule has an `R` configuration at one center and an `S` configuration at the other (i.e., `R,S` or `S,R`), it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule achiral, and it is known as a meso compound. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule has a chiral center at C1. C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH2-CH=, and -C=CH-CH2-. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This nomenclature refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposing CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive. In fact, none of the carbons bearing an OH group are true chiral centers because the paths around the ring from these carbons are identical.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Following IUPAC nomenclature, the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-(cyclopentyl)`. Let's examine this structure for any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The `(CH3)2CH-` group has no chiral center (the `CH` is bonded to two identical methyl groups).\n    *   The `-CH2-` and `-CO-` carbons are not chiral.\n    *   The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon atom attached to the carbonyl group and bisects the rest of the ring. Thus, no carbon in the ring is a chiral center.\n    Since the molecule has no chiral centers and lacks the structural features for other types of chirality (like atropisomerism), it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-..., (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\nTo computationally verify this analysis, we can use cheminformatics software.\n\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef is_optically_active(name, smiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a compound represented by a SMILES string is optically active (chiral).\n    A molecule is chiral if its canonical SMILES is different from its enantiomer's.\n    \"\"\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    if mol is None:\n        print(f\"{name}: Could not be processed (Invalid SMILES).

    "To determine if a compound is optically active, we need to assess its chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), provided the molecule does not possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond. The atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   Structure: This is a complex bicyclic compound. The IUPAC name provides the absolute configuration for multiple stereocenters (`3aR`, `7aS`) and the geometry of the double bond (`E`).\n    *   When a specific stereoisomer (like a single enantiomer) is named, it is by definition chiral, unless it's a meso compound. Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the core structure, and the specification of a single configuration, this molecule is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, with the `(2R,3S)` configuration, there is an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half of the molecule is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path one way around the ring), and 4) `-CH2-CH2-` (path the other way). This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    *   Since the molecule has a single chiral center and the name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, it is a pure chiral substance.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)`\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH-` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it's not chiral. The `-CH2-` and carbonyl (`C=O`) carbons are not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and passes through the center of the ring.\n    *   The entire molecule lacks any chiral centers and is symmetrical.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
