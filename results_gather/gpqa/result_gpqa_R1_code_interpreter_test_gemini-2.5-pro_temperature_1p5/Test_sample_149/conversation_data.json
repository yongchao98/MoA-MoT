    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound C8H9NO from the given NMR data.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (DoU = 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring).\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (below 7 ppm) suggest that the ring is substituted with at least one strong electron-donating group.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the aromatic proton shifts.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms its position adjacent to the aldehyde group (-CH2-CHO), as the CH2 protons are coupled to the CHO proton.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Starting Material:** Assembling the fragments (-NH2, a para-substituted benzene ring, and a -CH2CHO group) gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify its molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n    The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n    *   **1. NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        *   Intermediate after step 1: **4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride** ([Cl⁻][⁺N₂]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n    *   **2. H₂O:** The addition of water to an aryl diazonium salt, often with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   Intermediate after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n    *   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl). Such aldehydes undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product.\n            *   Aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in a highly stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group.\n            *   Dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal gives **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n    The question asks for the final product. Because the reaction is heated (condition 3), the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product A). The dehydration step is favored under these conditions to form the more thermodynamically stable conjugated product.\n    *   The final product is the aldol condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option B.\n    *   Option A is the intermediate before dehydration.\n    *   Option C has phenyl groups instead of hydroxyphenyl groups and an incorrect double bond position.\n    *   Option D has an incorrect structure that does not result from the self-condensation of two molecules.\n\n<<<B>>>"
