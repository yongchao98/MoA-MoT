    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium ion. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **Pentan-2-one derivative**: The core structure comes from pentan-2-one, which has the formula CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Secondary amine derivative**: The nitrogen part comes from an amine with a methyl group (\"N-methyl\") and an ethyl group (from \"ethanaminium,\" derived from ethanamine/ethylamine). The secondary amine is N-methylethanamine, CH₃-NH-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Iminium ion formation**: An iminium ion is formed by the condensation of a ketone (pentan-2-one) with a secondary amine (N-methylethanamine). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the nitrogen atom, which then bears a positive charge because it is bonded to four groups (two alkyl groups, and a double bond to carbon).\n\nThe structure of the iminium ion is:\n[CH₃–C(=N⁺(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃))–CH₂CH₂CH₃]\nThe `(E)` designation refers to the stereochemistry around the C=N double bond, but it is not crucial for determining the final product's constitution in this case, as this stereocenter is destroyed in the first step.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Sequence (A)**\n\nThe options propose a three-step reaction sequence, which is characteristic of the Stork enamine alkylation reaction.\n*   **(i) LDA, DME**: LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky), non-nucleophilic base. It is used to deprotonate a carbon atom alpha (adjacent) to the C=N⁺ group, forming an enamine. DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) is a polar aprotic solvent suitable for this reaction.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I**: Iodoethane (ethyl iodide) is an alkylating agent. The enamine formed in the first step will act as a nucleophile and attack the electrophilic ethyl group.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺**: This indicates an acidic workup (hydrolysis). The iminium ion formed after alkylation is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl compound (a ketone in this case).\n\n**3. Determine the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\nLet's follow the reaction step-by-step:\n\n*   **Step (i): Enamine Formation (Deprotonation)**\n    The iminium ion [CH₃–C(=N⁺R₂)–CH₂CH₂CH₃] has two sets of acidic alpha-protons:\n    1.  On the C1 methyl group (–CH₃).\n    2.  On the C3 methylene group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n    LDA is a bulky base and will preferentially remove a proton from the sterically less hindered position. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group. Therefore, deprotonation occurs at C1, leading to the formation of the *kinetic enamine*.\n    [CH₃–C(=N⁺R₂)–CH₂CH₂CH₃] + LDA → CH₂=C(NR₂)–CH₂CH₂CH₃\n\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation**\n    The kinetic enamine is a nucleophile at the C1 position. It attacks the electrophilic carbon of ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I), forming a new carbon-carbon bond and a new, larger iminium ion.\n    CH₂=C(NR₂)–CH₂CH₂CH₃ + CH₃CH₂I → [CH₃CH₂–CH₂–C(=N⁺R₂)–CH₂CH₂CH₃]\n\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis**\n    The acidic workup with H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the newly formed iminium ion back to a ketone. The C=N⁺ bond is replaced by a C=O bond.\n    [CH₃CH₂–CH₂–C(=N⁺R₂)–CH₂CH₂CH₃] + H₂O → CH₃CH₂–CH₂–C(=O)–CH₂CH₂CH₃ + [H₂N⁺R₂]\n\n*   **Identify Product B**\n    The final organic product (B) is CH₃CH₂–CH₂–C(=O)–CH₂CH₂CH₃. To name this ketone, we find the longest carbon chain containing the carbonyl group, which is a 7-carbon chain (heptane). We number the chain from the end that gives the carbonyl carbon the lowest possible number. In this symmetrical molecule, the carbonyl group is at carbon 4 from either end.\n    Therefore, the product B is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**: The product B is incorrect. The reaction is an alkylation, not a reversal to the starting ketone. The amine is also misidentified.\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺, B = heptan-4-one**: The product B is correct, but the description of the reagents (A) is procedurally incorrect. The reagents for steps (ii) and (iii) are not added simultaneously.\n*   **C) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺ B = heptan-4-one**: This option presents the correct, chemically logical sequence of reagents for A and correctly identifies the product B as heptan-4-one.\n*   **D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**: Both the reagent sequence and the product are incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption C accurately describes both the sequence of reagents (A) and the final product (B).\n\n<<<C>>>"
