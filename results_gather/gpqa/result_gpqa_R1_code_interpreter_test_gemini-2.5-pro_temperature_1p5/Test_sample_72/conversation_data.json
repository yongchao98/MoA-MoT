    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed between the two astronauts ($v_{rel}$).\nb) The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Astronaut 1:\n    *   Rest mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n    *   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Astronaut 2:\n    *   Rest mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n    *   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities ($v_2 - v_1$). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. For two objects moving in the same direction (collinear motion), the relative speed of object 2 as seen from object 1's reference frame is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nWe will substitute the given values of $v_1$ and $v_2$ into this formula. The question asks for the \"relative speed,\" which is the magnitude of this velocity.\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy (E) of a single particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nSo, the total energy of the system will be:\n\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = (\\gamma_1 m_1 c^2) + (\\gamma_2 m_2 c^2)$\n\nWe need to calculate $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ for each astronaut and then use them to find $E_1$, $E_2$, and finally $E_{total}$.\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we will use a Python script to perform the numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm1_coeff = 2.0  # Mass of astronaut 1 is 2m\nv1 = 0.6       # Speed of astronaut 1 is 0.6c\nm2_coeff = 3.0  # Mass of astronaut 2 is 3m\nv2 = 0.5       # Speed of astronaut 2 is 0.5c\n\n# Part A: Calculate Relative Speed\n# Using the formula: v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1*v2) in units of c\nv_rel_c = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n# The question asks for speed, which is the magnitude\nrelative_speed = abs(v_rel_c)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated relative speed: {relative_speed:.3f} c\")\n\n# Part B: Calculate Total Energy\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\n# Energy E = gamma * m * c^2\n# We calculate the coefficient of mc^2\n\n# For astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1_coeff = gamma1 * m1_coeff  # Coefficient of mc^2\n\n# For astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2_coeff = gamma2 * m2_coeff  # Coefficient of mc^2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total_coeff = E1_coeff + E2_coeff\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total energy: {E_total_coeff:.3f} mc^2\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nCalculated relative speed: 0.143 c\nCalculated total energy: 5.964 mc^2\n```\n\n**5. Analyze the Results and Choose the Answer**\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** The calculated relative speed is approximately $0.143c$. This matches the value of $0.14c$ in the options.\n*   **Total Energy:** The calculated total energy is approximately $5.964 mc^2$. This matches the value of $5.96 mc^2$ in the options.\n\nBoth calculated values match option B.\n\n**Manual Calculation Verification:**\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - (0.6)(0.5)} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -\\frac{1}{7}c \\approx -0.1428c$. Speed is $|-0.1428c| \\approx 0.14c$.\n*   $E_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0.6^2}}(2mc^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}}(2mc^2) = \\frac{1}{0.8}(2mc^2) = 1.25(2mc^2) = 2.5mc^2$.\n*   $E_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0.5^2}}(3mc^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}}(3mc^2) = \\frac{1}{0.866}(3mc^2) \\approx 1.1547(3mc^2) \\approx 3.464mc^2$.\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 = 5.964mc^2 \\approx 5.96mc^2$.\n\nThe manual calculations confirm the results from the script.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe relative speed is approximately $0.14c$ and the total energy of the system is approximately $5.96 mc^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Detailed analysis:**\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nIn classical physics, we would simply subtract the velocities: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. However, at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz transformation formula for velocities. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1 is given by:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\nLet's assign the frames:\n*   Frame S is the stationary frame (e.g., Earth).\n*   Frame S' is the reference frame of astronaut 2.\nWe want to find the velocity of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's frame. Let $u = v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v = v_2 = 0.5c$.\nThe velocity of astronaut 1 in frame S' ($u'$) is:\n$u' = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}}$\n$u' = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857 c$\nRounding to two decimal places gives **$v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Rest mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n    *   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy, $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Rest mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n    *   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy, $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 \\times mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places gives **$E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mcÂ². These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
