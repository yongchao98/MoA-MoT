    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2).\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars for which we have periods and radial velocity amplitudes. The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of such a system can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Laws. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, this relationship is:\n    M_total * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    where:\n    *   M_total is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n\n4.  **Interpret Key Information:** The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses\". An eclipsing binary system is one where the stars pass in front of each other from our point of view. This only happens when the orbital inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2πG)\n\n5.  **Set up the Mass Ratio Calculation:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2πG)\n    M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2πG)\n\n    When we take the ratio M1 / M2, the constant term (2πG) cancels out:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Values:**\n    *   **Period Ratio (P1 / P2):**\n        P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n    *   **Total Velocity Amplitude for System 1 (K1_total):**\n        K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **Total Velocity Amplitude for System 2 (K2_total):**\n        K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K1_total / K2_total):**\n        K1_total / K2_total = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute these values back into the ratio formula.\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is ~0.432. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 1.2\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script is used.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2)\n# The formula for the mass ratio is (P1/P2) * (K1_total/K2_total)^3\n# The constants (2*pi*G) cancel out.\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms the manually calculated result.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that also eclipses, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined using a simplified form of a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\nHere,\n*   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses, which implies that the inclination of the orbit (i) is close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1, allowing us to use this simplified formula.\n\nLet M1 be the total mass of system_1 and M2 be the total mass of system_2.\n\nFor system_1:\n*   Period P1 = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M1 = (P1 * (K_total_1)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\nFor system_2:\n*   Period P2 = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M2 = (P2 * (K_total_2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio M1 / M2:\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K_total_1)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K_total_2)³) / (2 * π * G) ]\n\nThe term (2 * π * G) cancels out, leaving:\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)³\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n*   P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   K_total_1 / K_total_2 = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nSubstitute these into the ratio equation:\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.432.
