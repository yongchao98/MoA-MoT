    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  **A chiral center (or stereocenter):** Typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Axial, planar, or helical chirality:** Chirality that arises from the arrangement of groups around an axis or a plane, without a specific chiral atom. A key example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls where bulky groups restrict rotation around the central single bond.\nA molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound based on these principles.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond. The ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions have bulky substituents, rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Due to this restricted rotation, the two phenyl rings are locked in a non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Consequently, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** Benzophenone, or diphenylmethanone, has the formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. Two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers. The double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (axial chirality).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
