    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOMe)₂). The protons on the central carbon (α-carbon) are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing ester groups.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n    *   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). The ethoxide ion (EtO⁻) is a strong base that will deprotonate the dimethyl malonate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile.** The ethoxide ion deprotonates dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion:\n        `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + EtO⁻ ⇌ ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Conjugate Addition).** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH-COOMe`\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) on the α-carbon to give the final neutral product.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -CH₂-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   Now, we must match this structure with the IUPAC names given in the options. Let's analyze the name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\".\n        *   **Parent chain:** propane (3 carbons: C1-C2-C3).\n        *   **Substituents:**\n            *   `1,1,3-tricarboxylate`: This indicates three methyl carboxylate (-COOMe) groups. Two are on C1, and one is on C3.\n            *   `2-(p-tolyl)`: A p-tolyl group is on C2.\n        *   **Assembling the structure:**\n            *   C1 with two -COOMe groups: `CH(COOMe)₂` (assuming one H to complete valency).\n            *   C2 with a p-tolyl group: `CH(p-Tolyl)`.\n            *   C3 with one -COOMe group: `CH₂COOMe`.\n        *   Connecting these fragments in order C1-C2-C3 gives: `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂COOMe`.\n    *   This assembled structure exactly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enolate, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are potent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reagents for Workup:** MeOH (methanol, a proton source) and H₃O⁺ (acidic aqueous workup).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   **Step 2: Intermediate Formation.** This forms a new C-C bond, resulting in an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The carbanion is protonated by methanol.\n    *   **Step 4: Hydrolysis.** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and an oxygen atom takes its place, regenerating the ketone.\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The original enamine came from cyclohexanone. The hydrolysis step regenerates the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon to the original carbonyl (C2 of the ring).\n    *   The group that is added is derived from but-2-enenitrile. The new bond is formed at its β-carbon. The original acceptor `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN` becomes the substituent `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group attached at the C2 position.\n    *   Let's name this product. The parent chain is butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. The cyclohexanone has its carbonyl at C1 and is attached to the chain via C2. So the substituent name is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This matches the option provided. The alternative, the enol form \"3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile\", is a tautomer, but the keto form is generally considered the major final product under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** C (the unknown Michael donor).\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Reagent:** KOH (potassium hydroxide), a base.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product to find Reactant C (Retro-Michael Reaction):**\n    *   The product name tells us the structure: a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring is substituted at position 2 with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group is `–CH₂–CH₂–C(=O)–CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor molecule's double bond is saturated, and the donor attaches to the β-carbon. The `(3-oxobutyl)` group corresponds to the MVK molecule after the reaction. The nucleophile from C must have attacked the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of MVK.\n    *   `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃` + (Nu⁻) → `Nu-CH₂-CH⁻-C(=O)CH₃` → (protonation) → `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This confirms MVK was the acceptor.\n    *   The remainder of the product molecule must have come from the Michael donor, C. The `Nu-` part is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` attached at its C2 position.\n    *   The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic and easily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThese results correspond exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
