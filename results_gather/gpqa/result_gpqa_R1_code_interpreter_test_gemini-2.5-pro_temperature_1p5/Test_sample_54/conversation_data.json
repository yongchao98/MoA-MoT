    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to 3 protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃COO-). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This value is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to 3 protons, a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning these 3 protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This fits the structure `CH₃-CH=`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of an allylic methyl group rules out butenyl acetate isomers like 1-butenyl acetate (`CH₃-CH₂-CH=...`) which would show signals for an ethyl group (a triplet and a quartet), or 3-butenyl acetate (`CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-O...`) which has a terminal alkene and no allylic methyl group. This strongly suggests a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=CH-`).\n\n    3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm (Vinylic Protons):**\n        *   These two signals are in the vinylic region (4.5-7.5 ppm), corresponding to the two protons on the double bond (-CH=CH-).\n        *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This proton is split into a doublet of quartets. The 'd' (doublet) comes from coupling to the other vinylic proton. The 'q' (quartet) comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent allylic methyl group (`CH₃`). This matches the proton in the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n        *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This proton is split into a doublet, meaning it is only coupled to the other vinylic proton. Its downfield chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n        *   **The Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans). A large coupling constant between vinylic protons (typically in the range of 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* relationship. A smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship. The observed value of 16.0 Hz is a clear indicator of a *trans* double bond.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   We have an acetate group (from the signal at 2.1 ppm).\n    *   We have a propenyl group, not a butenyl group (from the allylic methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm and the dq at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   The double bond has a *trans* configuration (from the J value of 16.0 Hz).\n\n    The compound is therefore **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Matching to Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect (not butenyl, not cis)\n    *   B) Cis-propenyl acetate - Incorrect (not cis)\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate - **Correct**\n    *   D) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect (not butenyl)\n\n<<<C>>>"
