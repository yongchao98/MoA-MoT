    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This can be expressed as:\n    Factor = Ratio (no spots) / Ratio (with spots)\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:** The star's photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of the population of two energy levels (n2/n1) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n    n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   n2, n1 are the number of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n    *   g2, g1 are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Factor Calculation:**\n    Let T_nospots be the temperature without spots and T_withspots be the temperature with spots.\n    *   Ratio (no spots) = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n    *   Ratio (with spots) = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspots))\n\n    The factor is the division of these two ratios:\n    Factor = [ (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g2/g1) cancels out:\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspots))\n\n    Using the property of exponents (exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_withspots)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_withspots - 1 / T_nospots) ]\n\n4.  **Identify the Temperatures:**\n    *   The temperature of the star without spots is given directly: T_nospots = 6000 K.\n    *   When the star has spots, its overall effective temperature is given: T_withspots = 5500 K. The properties of the integrated light (which is what astronomers observe) will be determined by this overall effective temperature.\n    *   The other information, like the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage, is contextual and not directly needed for the Boltzmann equation calculation, as the relevant temperatures are provided.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å.\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m.\n\n    The term needed in our formula is ΔE/k:\n    ΔE / k = (h * c) / (k * λ)\n\n6.  **Combine and Compute:**\n    Now we substitute all the values into the factor equation.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (n2/n1) of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratios under two different temperature conditions: with no spots and with spots.\n\n**1.

Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to a transition wavelength of λ = 1448 Å. We can calculate the energy ΔE using the formula:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nThe term we need for our factor equation is ΔE/k.\n\nΔE / k = (h * c) / (k * λ)\n\n**4.

Therefore, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two levels is about 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is consistent with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots (i.e., at a lower temperature).\n\n<<<C>>>",

Define the 'Factor'**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.
