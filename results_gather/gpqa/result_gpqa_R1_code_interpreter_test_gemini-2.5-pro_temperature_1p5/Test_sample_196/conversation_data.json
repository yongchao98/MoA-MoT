    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the given spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) is due to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Analysis of the alkyl side chain:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the methyl group and also to another carbon.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates a different methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton), which explains its downfield shift. It is coupled to the protons of both the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. Connecting them at the methine and methylene carbons gives the structure -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the evidence, Compound X is a benzene ring substituted at the para positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of various functional groups, including carboxylic acids, down to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The benzene ring itself and the sec-butyl side chain are not affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** -COOH → -CH₃\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in a para relationship on the benzene ring. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene).\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
