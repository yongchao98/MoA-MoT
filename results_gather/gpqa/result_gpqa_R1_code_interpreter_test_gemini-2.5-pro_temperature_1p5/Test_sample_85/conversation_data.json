    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring system). It is saturated (\"tetrahydro\") and has a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, making it a lactone (specifically, a delta-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon-4 of the ring.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon atoms within the ring, is a chiral center.\n*   **(R) and (S)**: The prefixes indicate the stereochemical configuration at this C4 chiral center.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  H2C(6) C=O (2)\n   |    |\n  H2C(5) CH2(3)\n   \\   /\n    CH (4)\n    |\n    CH2CH3\n```\n*   **Reaction 1 Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group on carbon-3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the carboxylic acid at the C5 position has been converted into an isobutyl ester (-COO-CH2CH(CH3)2).\n*   This molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n  HOOC(1) — CH2(2) — CH(3) — CH2(4) — C(=O)(5) — O-isobutyl\n                       |\n                       CH2CH3\n```\n*   **Functional Groups**: It contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an ester (-COOR') at C5.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group, is the chiral center.\n*   The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) isomer of this molecule.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: A relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. **It does not reduce carboxylic acids under normal conditions.**\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: A powerful reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce esters, the reaction with carboxylic acids is significantly faster. Therefore, it can be used to selectively reduce a carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: In both reaction pathways, the chemical transformations (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). This means the original stereochemistry of the C3 carbon is retained throughout the reaction. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. Therefore:\n*   An (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product.\n*   An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### **4. Applying the Logic to Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: `LiBH4` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`  ---`LiBH4`--->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The product is the **(R)-lactone**. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **A** must have been the **(R)-isomer**.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: `BH3` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester at C5 untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`  ---`BH3`--->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutyl alcohol to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The product is the **(S)-lactone**. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **B** must have been the **(S)-isomer**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
