    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** Located at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. The potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$. This is the time when the signal that reaches the observer at time `t` was emitted from the charge.\n*   **Retarded Position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Vector from Source to Observer:** The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Retarded Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is $d/c$. This must equal the time difference between emission and observation:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThis equation implicitly defines the retarded time $t_r$ for a given observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$. All quantities related to the source (its position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, velocity $\\vec{v}$, and the separation vector $\\vec{d}$) must be evaluated at this retarded time.\n\n### 3. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials from time-varying charge and current densities are the retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge, the densities are:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 4. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a non-trivial process because the retarded time depends on the integration variable. The key step involves a change of variables that introduces a correction factor.\n\nThe effect is that the charge `q` must be divided by a factor $1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}$, which accounts for the \"bunching up\" of the field lines due to the charge's motion (a Doppler-like effect). This factor is often written as $\\kappa = 1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The integral effectively evaluates to:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" signifies that all quantities in the bracket ($d, \\hat{d}, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    Using the notation given in the problem, where $\\vec{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are already defined at $t_r$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    The derivation is analogous. The source of the vector potential is the current $q\\vec{v}$.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Again, using the problem's notation:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived results with the given options.\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions perfectly match **Option A**.\n\n*   **Option B** is incorrect as it represents the static Coulomb potential, ignoring retardation and the effect of motion.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it has a `+` sign in the denominator. This would describe an \"advanced potential\" (determined by the charge's future state), which is physically rejected on grounds of causality.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect as it uses the static potential and has a physically nonsensical expression for $\\vec{A}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
