    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (Prob_1) and Planet_2 (Prob_2) to decide which one is a better candidate for observation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius.\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to find the ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2`.\n    `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    \n    The ratio is:\n    `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information about the Stars:** The problem states that both host stars have the same radii.\n    `R_s1 = R_s2`\n    Therefore, the `R_s1 / R_s2` term becomes 1.\n    `Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n    This means the ratio of transit probabilities is equal to the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Known Quantities:** We don't know the semi-major axes directly, but we have information about the orbital periods (P) and stellar masses (M_s). We can use Kepler's Third Law to find a relationship.\n    `P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * M_total)) * a^3`\n    Since the planets are \"Earth-like\", their mass (m_p) is negligible compared to the stellar mass (M_s), so `M_total ≈ M_s`.\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n    \n    Rearranging for the semi-major axis (a):\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n    `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-major Axes:** Now we can calculate the ratio `a_2 / a_1`.\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(P2^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * M_s1)]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Given Relationships:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`, which means `P2 = 3 * P1`.\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [((3 * P1)^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * (2 * M_s2))]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(9 * P1^2 * M_s2) / (2 * P1^2 * M_s2)]^(1/3)`\n    \n    The `P1^2` and `M_s2` terms cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Since `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have:\n    `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n    \n    To find the numerical value, we can compute the cube root of 4.5. Since the result is greater than 1, `Prob_1` is greater than `Prob_2`, so Planet_1 is the preferred target. We'll use a short python script for the precise calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the ratio of the transit probabilities.\n# The ratio is equal to (4.5)^(1/3).\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.650964024343163\n</execute_code>\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`. This means the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (Rₛ) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a), assuming a circular orbit and random inclination:\n\n`Probability (P_tr) = Rₛ / a`\n\nWe want to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_tr,1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_tr,2`) by finding their ratio:\n\n`Ratio = P_tr,1 / P_tr,2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that both host stars have the same radii:\n`R_s1 = R_s2`\nTherefore, the term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` is equal to 1, and the ratio simplifies to:\n\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law. For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the law is:\n`P² = (4π² / (G * Mₛ)) * a³`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period and `Mₛ` is the stellar mass.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n`a³ = (G * Mₛ * P²) / (4π²) `\n`a = (G * Mₛ * P² / (4π²))^(1/3)`\n\nSince `G` and `4π²` are constants, we can express `a` as a proportionality:\n`a ∝ (Mₛ * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, or `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n2. The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\nSubstituting these relationships into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1²) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `M_s2` and `P_1²` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nSince the probability ratio is `Ratio = P_tr,1 / P_tr,2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have:\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe code execution calculated this value to be approximately 1.65.\n`Ratio ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis means the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
