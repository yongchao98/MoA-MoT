    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reagents for the given chemical reactions.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n2.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** butan-2-one (a ketone). Its structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN), which provides the cyanide nucleophile, `CN⁻`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin). Its structure is `CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation:** The reaction involves the addition of a hydrogen atom (H) and a cyanide group (CN) across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond of the ketone. This is a characteristic reaction known as **cyanohydrin formation**.\n4.  **Mechanism and Reagents:** The mechanism for cyanohydrin formation involves two main steps:\n    *   Nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. This forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Protonation of the negatively charged oxygen in the alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH). This step requires a proton source (an acid).\n    *   Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) itself can be used, but it's a dangerous gas. A common and safer laboratory procedure is to generate HCN *in situ* by adding a strong acid to a salt like NaCN. The acid serves as the necessary proton source. The general representation for a strong acid in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, `H3O⁺`.\n5.  **Evaluate Options for A:**\n    *   `NaHSO3` (Sodium bisulfite) is used to form crystalline adducts with aldehydes and some ketones, a different type of reaction often used for purification. It is not the correct reagent for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   `H3O⁺` represents an acid source, which is required to protonate the intermediate and complete the reaction. This is a plausible reagent.\n6.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A** must be an acid, so `H3O⁺` is the correct choice. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n2.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The key functional group undergoing reaction is the nitrile group (`-C≡N`).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation:** This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**. It involves breaking the carbon-nitrogen triple bond and forming a carboxylic acid.\n4.  **Mechanism and Reagents:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with an aqueous solution of a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This directly produces the carboxylic acid. The overall reaction is: `R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺`.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with an aqueous solution of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This initially forms a carboxylate salt (`R-COO⁻Na⁺`), which must then be treated with acid in a separate step to produce the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   Since the product is shown as the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and not a salt, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is the most direct pathway described.\n5.  **Evaluate Options for B:**\n    *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is not an effective or standard reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. This reaction requires vigorous conditions, usually a strong acid.\n    *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n6.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B** should be a strong acid to efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis. **HCl** is the suitable choice.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   From the analysis of Reaction 1, Reagent **A** is `H3O⁺`.\n*   From the analysis of Reaction 2, Reagent **B** is `HCl`.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is `A = H3O⁺` and `B = HCl`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
