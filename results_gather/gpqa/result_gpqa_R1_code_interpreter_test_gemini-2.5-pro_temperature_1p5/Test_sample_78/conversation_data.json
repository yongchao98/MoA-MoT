    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Data to Determine its Structure\n\nThe problem provides the ¹H and ¹³C NMR data for the product formed from the reaction of Compound X (C11H12O). Our first goal is to determine the structure of this product.\n\n**1. Analyze the ¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically in a ketone or an aldehyde.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are in the aliphatic region. Given the ¹H NMR data (see below), these correspond to two different methyl (CH₃) groups. δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (an aryl-CH₃ group, like in toluene). δ 28.4 is consistent with a methyl group attached to a ketone carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Aromatic/Vinylic Region (δ 126.9 - 144.1):**\n    *   δ 126.9 (2C), δ 127.1 (1C), δ 129.1 (2C), δ 130.3 (1C): These six signals account for six CH carbons (methine groups), as confirmed by their intensities (2C + 1C + 2C + 1C = 6 C). These are typical shifts for carbons in aromatic rings or C=C double bonds.\n    *   δ 141.5 (1C), δ 144.1 (1C): These are deshielded carbons, and since all CH carbons are accounted for, these must be quaternary carbons (carbons with no attached hydrogens), likely within an aromatic ring or a conjugated system.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This supports the assignment of one as an aryl-CH₃ and the other as a keto-CH₃.\n*   **Aromatic/Vinylic Region (δ 6.75 - 7.71):**\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each for 1 proton, indicate two protons that are adjacent to each other (and each have only one proton neighbor). This is characteristic of a disubstituted C=C double bond (-CH=CH-). The downfield shifts suggest this double bond is part of a conjugated system.\n\n**3. Assemble the Product Structure:**\nBased on the analysis of both spectra, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   A ketone group: -C(=O)-\n*   A methyl ketone (acetyl) group: -COCH₃\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring with a methyl group on it (a p-tolyl group): p-CH₃-C₆H₄-\n*   A trans-disubstituted double bond: -CH=CH-\n\nConnecting these pieces gives the structure: **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O (7 from tolyl, 4 from the butenone chain). This matches the starting material.\n*   **¹H NMR:** It has a p-tolyl group (Ar-CH₃ singlet and two 2H doublets for the ring) and a trans-CH=CH-COCH₃ group (two 1H doublets for vinyl H's and one 3H singlet for the acetyl methyl). This matches the observed signals perfectly.\n*   **¹³C NMR:** The structure has 11 carbons. Due to the symmetry of the p-tolyl group, we expect 9 unique signals: 1 for Ar-CH₃, 1 for COCH₃, 1 for C=O, 2 for the quaternary aromatic carbons, 2 for the two pairs of equivalent aromatic CH carbons, and 2 for the two non-equivalent vinyl CH carbons. This matches the 9 signals provided in the data.\n\nThe product structure is confidently identified as **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Compound X by Analyzing the Reaction\n\nThe reaction starts with Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) and, under the influence of DABCO (a base) and heat, rearranges to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. We need to find which of the given options (A, B, C, D) would yield this product.\n\nLet's examine the options, which are all epoxides:\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O. This option is incorrect.\n*   The reaction is a rearrangement of a vinyl-substituted epoxide (a vinyloxirane). This class of compounds is known to rearrange to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The general transformation is `R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ → R-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-Me`. This compound does not have a p-tolyl group. Its rearrangement would likely lead to a product with a simple phenyl group (Ph-), which contradicts the NMR data of the product.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`. This also has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Furthermore, its rearrangement would lead to `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CO-CH₃`, which has a different substitution pattern on the double bond than the product we identified. This is inconsistent with the product's NMR.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is `p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct p-tolyl group and the vinyl epoxide structure. Applying the known rearrangement reaction:\n    `p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ --(DABCO, Heat)--> p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n    This transformation yields exactly the product that was identified from the NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product of the reaction is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This product can be formed from the base-catalyzed thermal rearrangement of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
