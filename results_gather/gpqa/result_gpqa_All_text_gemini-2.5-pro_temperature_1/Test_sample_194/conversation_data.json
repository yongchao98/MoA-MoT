    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry and Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star as seen by an observer.\n    *   **Occultation (Secondary Eclipse):** A planet passes behind its star.\n    *   **Circular Orbits in the Same Plane:** Both planets orbit the same star in circular paths and share the same orbital plane. This is a crucial piece of information because it means the orbital inclination (`i`), the angle between our line of sight and the orbital plane, is the same for both planets.\n    *   **Impact Parameter (b):** This is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius (`R_star`). The formula for the impact parameter is:\n        `b = (a / R_star) * cos(i)`\n        where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit (equal to the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\n2.  **Determine the Condition for Transits and Occultations:**\n    *   For a planet to transit its star, its path must cross the star's disk. The simplest condition for a clear, non-grazing transit is that the center of the planet must pass over the stellar disk. This means the impact parameter `b` must be less than 1 (`b < 1`).\n    *   If `b < 1`, the planet will transit in front of the star. Because the orbit is circular, it will also be occulted when it passes behind the star half an orbit later.\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum* orbital period. A larger orbital period implies a larger semi-major axis (`a`) according to Kepler's Third Law. A larger `a` leads to a larger impact parameter `b`.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter for which a transit still occurs. We take this limiting value to be `b_max = 1`.\n\n3.  **Use Planet 1's Data to Find a Constant Relationship:**\n    *   We are given information for Planet 1: Period `P1 = 3` days, impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`.\n    *   We can write the impact parameter equation for Planet 1:\n        `b1 = (a1 / R_star) * cos(i)`\n    *   And for Planet 2:\n        `b2 = (a2 / R_star) * cos(i)`\n    *   Since `R_star` and `cos(i)` are the same for both planets, we can find a relationship between the two equations by isolating `cos(i) / R_star`:\n        `cos(i) / R_star = b1 / a1`\n        `cos(i) / R_star = b2 / a2`\n    *   Therefore, we can set them equal:\n        `b1 / a1 = b2 / a2`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star:\n        `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine Equations and Solve for the Maximum Period of Planet 2 (P2_max):**\n    *   From our relationship in Step 3, we can write `b2 = b1 * (a2 / a1)`.\n    *   Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` from Kepler's Law into this equation:\n        `b2 = b1 * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n    *   We want to find the maximum period, `P2_max`, which occurs at the maximum impact parameter, `b2_max = 1`.\n        `1 = b1 * (P2_max / P1)^(2/3)`\n    *   Now, we solve for `P2_max`:\n        `(P2_max / P1)^(2/3) = 1 / b1`\n        `P2_max / P1 = (1 / b1)^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Plug in the known values: `P1 = 3` days and `b1 = 0.2`.\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    *   `5^(3/2)` is the same as `5 * sqrt(5)`. The square root of 5 is approximately 2.236.\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * (5 * 2.236)`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * 11.18`\n    *   `P2_max â‰ˆ 33.54` days\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The radius of the star (`1.5 R_sun`) and the radii of the planets (`1 R_earth` and `2.5 R_earth`) are not needed for this specific calculation. The stellar radius `R_star` cancels out, and the planetary radii are only relevant if considering the precise condition for a grazing transit (`b < 1 + R_p/R_star`), which is generally not the standard assumption unless specified. The `b < 1` condition for the planet's center is the standard for a non-grazing transit.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated assumptions of circular orbits and a shared orbital plane.\n*   **Limiting Condition:** The key is identifying that the maximum period corresponds to the maximum allowable impact parameter for a transit, which is `b=1`.\n\nThe calculated maximum period is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<A>>>"
