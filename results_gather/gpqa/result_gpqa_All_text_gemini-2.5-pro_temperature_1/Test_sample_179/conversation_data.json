    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Components**\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles.\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602 x 10^-19 C`).\n*   One particle (let's call it `q_P`) is fixed at a point P.\n*   The other 12 particles (let's call them `q_i`, for `i=1...12`) are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n*   The total electrostatic potential energy (`E_total`) of this isolated system is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges.\n\nThe total energy can be broken down into two parts:\n1.  `E_cp`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge `q_P` and the 12 charges `q_i` on the sphere.\n2.  `E_ss`: The potential energy from the mutual interaction among the 12 charges `q_i` on the sphere.\n\nSo, `E_total = E_cp + E_ss`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Energy Components**\n\n*   **Energy `E_cp` (Center-Periphery):**\n    The distance between the central charge `q_P` and each of the 12 outer charges `q_i` is fixed at `R = 2 m`.\n    The potential energy for one such pair is `k * q_P * q_i / R`. Since all charges are identical (`q_P = q_i = q`), this is `k * q^2 / R`.\n    Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy from these interactions is:\n    `E_cp = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n    This value is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere because `R` is fixed.\n\n*   **Energy `E_ss` (Sphere-Sphere):**\n    This is the energy from the repulsion among the 12 charges on the sphere's surface. The potential energy for any pair `(q_i, q_j)` is `k * q^2 / r_ij`, where `r_ij` is the distance between them.\n    `E_ss = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\n    To find the *minimum* energy of the whole system, we must find the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes `E_total`. Since `E_cp` is constant, this is equivalent to minimizing `E_ss`.\n\n**3. The Thomson Problem and the Icosahedron**\nMinimizing `E_ss` requires maximizing the distances `r_ij` between the charges as much as possible. This is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**. For `N=12` charges on a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for the Icosahedral Configuration**\nAn icosahedron has 12 vertices. From any given vertex, the other 11 vertices are at three distinct distances:\n*   **5 adjacent vertices:** at a distance `a`, the edge length of the icosahedron. There are `(12 * 5) / 2 = 30` such pairs (edges) in total.\n*   **5 non-adjacent vertices:** at a distance `a * φ`, where `φ = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 ≈ 1.618` is the golden ratio. There are `(12 * 5) / 2 = 30` such pairs.\n*   **1 antipodal vertex:** at a distance `2R`, the diameter of the sphere. There are `12 / 2 = 6` such pairs.\n\nThe edge length `a` of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` is related by the formula: `a^2 = 4R^2 / (1 + φ^2)`.\n\nNow we can write the expression for `E_ss`:\n`E_ss = k * q^2 * [30/a + 30/(a*φ) + 6/(2R)]`\n`E_ss = k * q^2 * [ (30/a) * (1 + 1/φ) + 3/R ]`\nUsing the property `1 + 1/φ = φ`, this simplifies to:\n`E_ss = k * q^2 * [ 30*φ/a + 3/R ]`\n\nLet's express `a` in terms of `R` to evaluate the term in the brackets.\nFrom `a^2 = 4R^2 / (1 + φ^2)`, we get `a = 2R / sqrt(1 + φ^2)`.\nSubstitute this into the expression for `E_ss`:\n`E_ss = k * q^2 * [ (30*φ) / (2R / sqrt(1 + φ^2)) + 3/R ]`\n`E_ss = (k * q^2 / R) * [ 15*φ*sqrt(1 + φ^2) + 3 ]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Coefficient**\nLet's evaluate the dimensionless coefficient `C_ss = 15*φ*sqrt(1 + φ^2) + 3`.\n*   `φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618034`\n*   `1 + φ^2 = 1 + ((1+sqrt(5))/2)^2 = 1 + (6+2*sqrt(5))/4 = (10+2*sqrt(5))/4 = (5+sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 3.618034`\n*   `sqrt(1 + φ^2) ≈ 1.902113`\n*   `C_ss = 15 * (1.618034) * (1.902113) + 3 ≈ 15 * (3.07768) + 3 ≈ 46.165 + 3 = 49.165`\n\nSo, `E_ss ≈ 49.165 * (k * q^2 / R)`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy**\nNow, sum the two energy components:\n`E_total = E_cp + E_ss`\n`E_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + 49.165 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`E_total = (12 + 49.165) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`E_total = 61.165 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**7. Substitute the Physical Constants**\n*   `k = 8.98755 x 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `q = 2e = 2 * (1.602177 x 10^-19 C) = 3.204354 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `q^2 ≈ 1.026788 x 10^-37 C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy unit `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`k * q^2 / R = (8.98755 x 10^9 * 1.026788 x 10^-37) / 2`\n`k * q^2 / R ≈ (9.2285 x 10^-28) / 2 = 4.61425 x 10^-28 J`\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy:\n`E_total = 61.165 * (4.61425 x 10^-28 J)`\n`E_total ≈ 2.8224 x 10^-26 J`\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe calculated minimum energy is `2.8224 x 10^-26 J`. This value, when rounded to three decimals, is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
