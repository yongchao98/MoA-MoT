    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics Principle:** The core of this question lies in the concept of **time dilation** from Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity. Time dilation describes how time passes at different rates for observers in different reference frames, especially when one is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to the other. The time experienced by the moving observer (the astronaut) is called the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**, and it is shorter than the time measured by a stationary observer (on Earth), which is called the **dilated time (`Δt`)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Given and Required Information:**\n    *   **Given Speed (v):** `v = 0.99999987 * c`\n    *   **Given Astronaut's Age:** 22 years\n    *   **Given Alien Lifespan:** 150 years\n    *   **Implicit Information (Distance, d):** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth is not explicitly stated. We must use a standard astronomical value. The LMC is approximately **159,000 light-years** away from Earth. This value is chosen because it leads to one of the given answers.\n    *   **Required Information:** The time it takes for the journey from the astronaut's point of view (`Δt₀`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   First, calculate the time the journey would take from the perspective of a stationary observer on Earth (`Δt`).\n    *   Second, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ`), which quantifies the effect of time dilation.\n    *   Third, use the time dilation formula to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (`Δt₀`).\n    *   Finally, check if this duration is within the astronaut's remaining lifespan.\n\n### Execution of the Plan\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Journey Time in Earth's Frame (`Δt`)**\n\nThe time for a journey is distance divided by speed.\n*   Distance `d` = 159,000 light-years\n*   Speed `v` = 0.99999987 * c\n\n`Δt = d / v = (159,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c)`\n\nSince 1 light-year is the distance light travels in one year (`c * 1 year`), the `c` terms cancel out.\n\n`Δt = 159,000 years / 0.99999987 ≈ 159,000.02` years.\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 159,000 years.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by the formula: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   `v/c = 0.99999987`\n*   `(v/c)² = 0.99999987² ≈ 0.99999974`\n*   `1 - (v/c)² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026`\n*   `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099`\n*   `γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16`\n\nThis means for every 1 year experienced by the astronaut, about 1961 years pass on Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Journey Time in Astronaut's Frame (`Δt₀`)**\n\nThe time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`. We need to find the astronaut's time, so we rearrange it: `Δt₀ = Δt / γ`.\n\n*   `Δt₀ = 159,000.02 years / 1961.16`\n*   `Δt₀ ≈ 81.07` years.\n\nSo, from the astronaut's point of view, the journey will take approximately **81 years**.\n\n**Step 4: Check for Survival**\n\n*   The astronaut's age at the start is 22 years.\n*   The astronaut's species has a lifespan of 150 years.\n*   Remaining lifespan = `150 - 22 = 128` years.\n*   Since the journey takes 81 years (`Δt₀`), and `81 < 128`, the astronaut will survive the journey. They will be `22 + 81 = 103` years old upon arrival. This eliminates option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Reference Frames:** It is critical to distinguish between the time measured on Earth (`Δt`) and the time measured on the spacecraft (`Δt₀`). The question asks for the latter.\n2.  **Implicit Distance:** The problem relies on using a standard astronomical distance for the LMC. The choice of ~159,000 light-years is key to matching one of the options.\n3.  **Lifespan Check:** The information about the astronaut's age and lifespan is not just flavor text; it's necessary to rule out the option that the astronaut would not survive the journey.\n4.  **High-Precision Calculation:** Because the speed is extremely close to the speed of light, the Lorentz factor is very large, and calculations must be done carefully to get an accurate result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the journey will take approximately 81 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n<<<A>>>"
