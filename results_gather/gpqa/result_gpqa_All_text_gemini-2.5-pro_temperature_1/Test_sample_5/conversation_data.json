    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in two-dimensional polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert this potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Coordinate Transformation**\nRecall the transformation rules from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nWe can substitute these into the potential expression. The term `r cos(θ)` is simply `x`, and `r^2` is `x^2 + y^2`.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nSubstitute the Cartesian relations into the potential V(r, θ):\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Cartesian Potential**\n\nNow, group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Separable Form**\nThe potential is now in the form V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional problems, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate. The total energy will be the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the Energy in the x-direction**\n\nThe potential in the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We need to match this to the standard one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) potential form, U(x) = 1/2 mω^2 x^2.\nSo, 1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2 = 2kx^2.\nThis gives 1/2 m(ω_x)^2 = 2k, which means (ω_x)^2 = 4k/m.\nThe angular frequency for the x-motion is ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n\nThe energy levels for a 1D QHO are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. For the x-direction, with quantum number n_x:\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Energy in the y-direction**\n\nThe potential in the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\nMatching this to the standard QHO potential U(y) = 1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2:\n1/2 m(ω_y)^2 = 1/2 k, which means (ω_y)^2 = k/m.\nThe angular frequency for the y-motion is ω_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nThe energy levels for the y-direction, with quantum number n_y, are:\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Careful Point 3: Summing the Energies Correctly**\nThe total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators. The quantum numbers n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the Total Energy Expression**\n\nFactor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nDistribute the 2 in the first term:\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nCombine the constant terms inside the bracket:\nE = [ 2n_x + n_y + (1 + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Step 7: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\nLet's check the given options:\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
