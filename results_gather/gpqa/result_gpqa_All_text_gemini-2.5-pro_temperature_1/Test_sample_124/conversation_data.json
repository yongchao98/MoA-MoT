    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**1. Identify the Physical System:**\nThe problem describes a quantum mechanical particle of mass $m$ moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by:\n$V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\nwhere $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This potential is \"isotropic\" because it depends only on the distance from the origin, $r$, and not on the direction.\n\n**2. Choose a Suitable Coordinate System:**\nThis problem can be solved using either Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ or spherical polar coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$. Both methods will lead to the same result for the energy levels and their degeneracies. We will use the Cartesian coordinate approach as it is often more straightforward for this specific potential.\n\n**3. Analyze the Hamiltonian in Cartesian Coordinates:**\nThe potential can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n$V(x, y, z) = V_x(x) + V_y(y) + V_z(z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$\nBecause the potential is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues of the three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\n**4. Recall the Energy Eigenvalues of a 1D Harmonic Oscillator:**\nThe energy levels of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where the quantum number $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n**5. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues of the 3D System:**\nFor our 3D system, we have three independent quantum numbers, $n_x, n_y, n_z$, one for each dimension. The total energy is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels depend only on this sum $N$:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n**6. Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\nWe need to find the energy for the different states, starting from the ground state.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state. It occurs when $N=0$, which corresponds to $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next lowest energy state. It occurs when $N=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This is the third lowest energy state. It occurs when $N=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This is the fourth lowest energy state, corresponding to $N=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n**7. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to write $N=3$ as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   **One quantum number is 3:**\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n*   **One quantum number is 2, another is 1:**\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n*   **All quantum numbers are 1:**\n    *   (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\nTotal number of combinations (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The question is about a **3D** isotropic harmonic oscillator, not a 1D one. The ground state energy is $(3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, not $(1/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   The \"third excited state\" corresponds to $N=3$, not $n=3$. The ground state is $N=0$.\n*   The degeneracy is the number of distinct quantum states $(\\Psi_{n_x, n_y, n_z})$ that share the same energy eigenvalue.\n*   The energy formula in options C and D is characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical well, which is a different physical system. This allows for their immediate elimination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe degeneracy of this state is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
