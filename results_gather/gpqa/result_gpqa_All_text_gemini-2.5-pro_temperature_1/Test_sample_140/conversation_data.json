    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH2 in liquid ammonia.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring that has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like sodium amide proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the proton (H) from C6 than the deuteron (d) from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both elimination pathways, even if one is slower than the other.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of d from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), will now attack one of the carbons of the strained triple bond in the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The two ends of the triple bond are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. By IUPAC naming conventions (numbering the ring to give the substituent the lowest number), if the -NH2 group is at position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (standard benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (aminobenzene).\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can list all the unique organic products that can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **three** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
