    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. This can be written as `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Physical Concepts:**\n    *   The problem describes spectroscopic binary systems that are also eclipsing. This is key information.\n    *   For a binary system, the individual masses (m_a, m_b) and the total mass (M = m_a + m_b) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the orbital velocities.\n    *   The sinusoidal variation in radial velocities implies that the orbits can be approximated as circular.\n    *   The fact that the systems are eclipsing implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   The observed radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the true orbital velocity `v` by `K = v * sin(i)`. Since `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can approximate `K ≈ v`.\n\n4.  **Recall the Relevant Formula:**\n    The total mass `M` of a binary system can be found using a combination of Kepler's Third Law and the definition of orbital velocity. The resulting formula for the total mass, assuming circular orbits, is:\n    `M = (P * (v_a + v_b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `v_a` and `v_b` are the orbital speeds of the two stars.\n    Since we are dealing with radial velocities `K` and have assumed `sin(i) ≈ 1`, we can replace the orbital speeds `v` with their observed amplitudes `K`:\n    `M = (P * (K_a + K_b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio `M1 / M2`. We can set up the equation as follows:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]`\n    The constants `2`, `π`, and `G` will cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ ]`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Units:** As we are calculating a ratio, the units for Period (years) and Velocity (km/s) will cancel out as long as they are consistent for both systems. There is no need to convert them to SI units (seconds and m/s).\n*   **Assumptions:** The accuracy of the result depends on the validity of the assumptions: circular orbits (`sinusoidal variations`) and edge-on inclination (`eclipses`). These are standard and justified assumptions for this type of problem.\n*   **Sum of Velocities:** It is the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K_a + K_b`), which represents the amplitude of the relative velocity between the two stars, that is used in the formula for the total mass.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system:**\n    *   System 1: `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   System 2: `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n2.  **Substitute the values into the ratio formula:**\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K1a + K1b = 15` km/s\n    *   `K2a + K2b = 25` km/s\n\n    `M1 / M2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    The fraction `15 / 25` simplifies to `3 / 5`.\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3³ / 5³)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is `0.432`.\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 0.7\n    C) ~ 1.2\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.432. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
