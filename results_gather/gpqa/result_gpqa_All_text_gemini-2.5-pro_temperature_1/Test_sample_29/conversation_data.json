    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Relationship between Energy, Wavelength, and Color**\nThe energy of light (a photon) is inversely proportional to its wavelength. This relationship is described by the equation E = hc/λ, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. A convenient formula for quick calculations is:\n\nλ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E (in eV)\n\nThe color of light is determined by its wavelength, following the visible spectrum (from longer to shorter wavelength: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Wavelength of the Emitted Light**\nThe problem states that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength:\n\nλ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\nλ_emitted ≈ 530 nm\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Color of the Emitted Light**\nWe need to locate this wavelength on the visible spectrum:\n*   Violet: ~400-450 nm\n*   Blue: ~450-495 nm\n*   **Green: ~495-570 nm**\n*   Yellow: ~570-590 nm\n*   Orange: ~590-620 nm\n*   Red: ~620-750 nm\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls squarely in the **green** region of the spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Principle of Complementary Colors**\nFor dyes and other colored objects (that are not themselves light sources like an LED), the color we perceive is the color of light that is reflected or transmitted, not absorbed. The color that is absorbed is the complementary color to the one we see.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The question uses the word \"emits,\" which could imply fluorescence. In fluorescence, the absorbed energy is always higher than the emitted energy (Stokes Shift). However, in the context of textile dyes and color, the most common and fundamental principle is that of complementary colors. The color an object *appears* is the complement of the color it *absorbs*. We will assume the question uses \"emits\" as a way to describe the color that is perceived by an observer.\n\nThe dye appears green. We need to find the complementary color of green. The pairs of complementary colors are:\n*   Red ↔ Green\n*   Orange ↔ Blue\n*   Yellow ↔ Violet\n\nSince the dye appears green, it must be absorbing its complementary color, which is **Red**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Check**\n*   The dye appears green (emits/reflects light with λ ≈ 530 nm).\n*   To appear green, it must absorb the complementary color from white light.\n*   The complement of green is red.\n*   Therefore, the dye absorbs red light. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
