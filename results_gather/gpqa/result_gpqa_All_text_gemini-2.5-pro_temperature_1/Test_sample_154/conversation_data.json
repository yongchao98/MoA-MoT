    "An analysis of the question is provided below, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The operator $P_z$ is represented by the matrix:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The basis vectors for these representations are the eigenvectors of $P_z$.\n    *   The information about $P_x$ and $P_y$ is contextual but not required for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Define the Uncertainty:**\n    The uncertainty of an observable (represented by an operator $A$) in a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where:\n    *   $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n    *   $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n    For this problem, we need to find $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since the components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Now we use the formula for uncertainty with the values we calculated:\n        $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    *   Taking the square root to find the uncertainty:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Basis:** The problem states that the matrices are written in the basis of eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is a crucial piece of information. Since $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, its diagonal elements $(\\hbar, 0, -\\hbar)$ are its eigenvalues.\n*   **State Vector:** The components of the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ are the coefficients of the expansion of the state in terms of the eigenvectors of $P_z$.\n*   **Alternative Method:** Because we are in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, we can use a simpler method based on probabilities. The state is $|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)|+\\hbar\\rangle + (1/\\sqrt{2})|0\\rangle + (-1/2)|-\\hbar\\rangle$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $+\\hbar$: $P(+\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $0$: $P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $-\\hbar$: $P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$.\n    *   $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (+\\hbar)P(+\\hbar) + (0)P(0) + (-\\hbar)P(-\\hbar) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$.\n    *   $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (+\\hbar)^2 P(+\\hbar) + (0)^2 P(0) + (-\\hbar)^2 P(-\\hbar) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$.\n    *   $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\hbar^2/2 - 0^2 = \\hbar^2/2 \\implies \\Delta P_z = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This confirms the result.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The explicit forms of $P_x$ and $P_y$, and the fact that the state is an eigenstate of $P_x$, are not needed to compute $\\Delta P_z$. They are consistent with the problem setup but are not part of the direct calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated uncertainty is $\\Delta P_z = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
