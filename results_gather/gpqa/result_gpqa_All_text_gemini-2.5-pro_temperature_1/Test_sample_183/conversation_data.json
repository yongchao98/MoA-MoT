    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative Positions:** The groups are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo achieve a high-yield synthesis, the directing effects of the substituents must be carefully controlled, often using activating/deactivating properties and blocking groups.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Moderately activating, ortho/para director. Very bulky, so it often directs to the para position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director. (Common intermediate).\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta director. Crucially, it's a reversible group (can be removed with dilute acid and heat), making it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence that logically and efficiently places the three groups in the correct 1,2,3 orientation. Synthesizing such a crowded molecule often requires a blocking group strategy to force substituents into positions they would not normally occupy.\n\nLet's analyze the beginning of each sequence, as this is the most critical part for setting up the regiochemistry.\n\n*   **Sequence A:**\n    *   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → The Lewis acid AlCl3 complexes with the -NH2 group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing group (-NH2+-AlCl3). This correctly yields **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group (activating, o,p director) and -tBu group (activating, o,p director) cooperatively direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is highly sterically hindered. The major products would be 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the required 2-nitro isomer. This path fails to provide a high yield.\n\n*   **Sequence B:**\n    *   i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → The bulky t-butyl group strongly directs nitration to the para position, yielding mainly **4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → The ring is deactivated, but both groups direct to position 2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to NO2), yielding **4-nitro-2-sulfo-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iv) + NaNO2/HCl → This reagent is for diazotizing an amine (-NH2). The current molecule has a nitro group (-NO2). This step is chemically impossible. The sequence fails.\n\n*   **Sequence C:**\n    *   The sequence of reagents seems illogical. For instance, sulfonation (viii) and desulfonation (ix) are placed near the end, after several other transformations have occurred, which makes no strategic sense for a blocking group. The entire sequence is out of order.\n\n*   **Sequence D:**\n    *   i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → The bulky t-butyl group directs sulfonation to the less hindered para position. This forms **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic blocking group strategy, protecting the para position.\n    *   iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → Now we nitrate. The -tBu group is an o,p director, and the -SO3H group is a meta director.\n        *   -tBu (at pos 1) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   -SO3H (at pos 4) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (or 6, which is equivalent). This yields **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This intermediate correctly establishes the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n    *   iv) + Fe/HCl → The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   v) + NaNO2/HCl → The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   The subsequent steps (vi-ix) are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, likely due to typos in the question. However, the initial steps (i-iii) represent the most logical and effective strategy among all options for creating the necessary 1,2-disubstituted pattern (t-Bu and NO2 ortho to each other) by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. No other option presents a viable high-yield path. Despite the apparent errors in the later steps, the core strategy of Sequence D is the most sound. It establishes the critical ortho relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups, which is essential for forming the final product. The subsequent steps would involve replacing the sulfonic acid and the diazonium group with the required ethoxy group and then re-introducing a nitro group in the correct location, or a similar series of transformations. The beginning of sequence D is the only one that correctly sets up the key structural feature.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D outlines the most plausible synthetic strategy, especially in its initial steps, which employ a blocking group to correctly establish the ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a future nitro group. While the full sequence as written has errors, its strategic foundation is superior to the other options, which contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities or low-yield steps early on.\n\n<<<D>>>"
