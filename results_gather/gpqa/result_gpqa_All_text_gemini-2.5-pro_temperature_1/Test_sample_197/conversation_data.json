    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Equilibria**\nWe have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). These ions react to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is denoted as c(Co). The problem asks for the percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to this total concentration.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺       ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]     ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻   ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**3. Express Each Complex Concentration in Terms of [Co²⁺]**\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**4. Substitute these Expressions into the Total Concentration Equation**\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺], we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Desired Percentage**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This is also known as the distribution coefficient (α₂) expressed as a percentage.\n\nPercentage = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\nPercentage = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))) * 100\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\nPercentage = (β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) * 100\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem gives c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. We need to use the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, [SCN⁻]. Since the total concentration of the ligand (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] as being equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration c(Co) is not needed for the final calculation of the percentage.\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator's sum:\n*   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n*   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the sum in the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator of our fraction is the term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction:\nFraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis value is very close to 16.9%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
