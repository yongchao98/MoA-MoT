    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material from the Molecular Formula and NMR Data.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE). The C=O of an aldehyde would account for this.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂-CHO group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, where the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts, particularly the upfield signal at 6.51 ppm, suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong EDG, which explains the observed aromatic shifts.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is an amino group (-NH₂), and the other must be the acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) to account for all remaining atoms (C₂H₃O).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence.**\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These are the reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        *   *Intermediate 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n    *   **Step 2: H₂O:** The diazonium salt is treated with water. When warmed, diazonium salts hydrolyze, and the -N₂⁺ group (an excellent leaving group) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a type of Sandmeyer-like reaction.\n        *   *Intermediate 2:* **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the product from step 2 (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** A base (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            *   The addition product is: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. (This corresponds to option A).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-hydrogen (at C-2) and the β-hydroxyl group (at C-3) are removed to form a double bond. This process is called dehydration or condensation. The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            *   The condensation product is: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. (This corresponds to option B).\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product.**\n    *   The term \"aldol condensation\" technically refers to the two-step process of addition followed by dehydration. The presence of heat strongly favors the dehydration step because the resulting conjugated system (the C=C double bond is conjugated with both the C=O of the aldehyde and one of the phenyl rings) is thermodynamically very stable.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition product (A), but will proceed to the more stable condensation product (B).\n    *   Option C is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n    *   Option D is incorrect as it is not a dimerization product and has the wrong number of carbon atoms.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration promoted by heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
