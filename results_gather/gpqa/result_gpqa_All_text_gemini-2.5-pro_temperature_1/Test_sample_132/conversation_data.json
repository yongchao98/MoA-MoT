    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\nThe solution is prepared by dissolving two salts in water:\n1.  KH₂PO₄: This salt dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n2.  Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O: This hydrated salt dissociates completely into 2 Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 H₂O.\n\nThe key species for the acid-base equilibrium are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.**\nWe use the formula: moles = mass / molar mass.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (and thus H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (and thus HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**Careful point:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O), not the anhydrous form, as the mass given is for the hydrate.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.**\nWe use the formula: Concentration (M) = moles / volume (L).\n\n*   **Volume of solution:**\n    *   V = 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.20000 L\n\n*   **Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 4: Determine the primary equilibrium and calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\nThe solution contains a conjugate acid-base pair (H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻), which constitutes a buffer. The pH of this buffer is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which involves this pair.\n\n*   **Relevant equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n*   **Equilibrium constant:** Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = ([H⁺] * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\nSince this is a buffer solution, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n\n*   **Calculate [H⁺]:**\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Careful point:** We use Ka₂ because the buffer system is composed of the species involved in the second dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).**\nThe orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   **Relevant equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n*   **Equilibrium constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange the Ka₃ expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\nKa₃ = ([H⁺] * [PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (its dissociation into PO₄³⁻ is negligible because Ka₃ is very small).\n\n*   **Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated concentration is 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures (consistent with the input data), we get 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n*   A) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n*   B) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe final answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
