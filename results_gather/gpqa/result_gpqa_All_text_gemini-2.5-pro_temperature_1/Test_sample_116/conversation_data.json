    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some allenes and atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Let's analyze each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This occurs when the rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted due to steric hindrance from large substituents at the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are occupied by bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). This bulkiness prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar, and the free rotation around the central C-C bond is hindered.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a twisted conformation. This twisted structure does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to hindered rotation (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:** We look for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 atom is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group.\n    *   More importantly, a plane of symmetry can be found. Imagine a plane that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. This plane divides the molecule into two identical halves.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: **Shows optical isomerism** (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: **Shows optical isomerism** (has a chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: **Does not show optical isomerism** (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: **Does not show optical isomerism** (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
