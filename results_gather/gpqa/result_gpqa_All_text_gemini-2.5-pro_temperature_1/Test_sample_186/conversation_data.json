    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Detection Criteria\n\nFirst, we need to understand the conditions under which a star is considered \"detectable\" by the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n*   **Telescope:** One 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT) unit, which corresponds to the \"1-UT mode\" for ESPRESSO.\n*   **Instrument:** ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n*   **Exposure Time:** 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n*   **Detection Threshold:** A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\n\nWe consult the official ESPRESSO overview page provided. In the \"Performance and ETC\" section, it states:\n\"For a S/N of 10 per pixel at 550nm for a G2V star with an exposure time of 1 hour, the limiting magnitudes are: V ~ 16.5 for the HR (High Resolution) mode in 1UT\".\n\nThis gives us our key criterion: **A star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude (V) is brighter than or equal to 16.5 (i.e., V ≤ 16.5).**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Observability from Paranal\n\nA star must be visible from the observatory's location.\n*   **Observatory:** Paranal Observatory, Chile.\n*   **Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Visibility Rule:** Stars with very high positive declinations are not visible from a southern hemisphere observatory. A star is generally considered unobservable if it never rises above the horizon. For Paranal at -24.6° latitude, any star with a declination greater than approximately +65° will always be below the horizon.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against two conditions:\n1.  Is it visible from Paranal? (Declination check)\n2.  Is it bright enough? (Apparent V magnitude ≤ 16.5)\n\n---\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. This is in the southern celestial hemisphere and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the sky, with an apparent V magnitude of **-0.74**.\n*   **Conclusion:** V = -0.74 is much brighter than the limit of 16.5. Therefore, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris has a declination of approximately +89° 15'. Since Paranal is at a latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and is impossible to observe.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent V magnitude is +1.98. While it is bright enough, its location makes it unobservable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Polaris is not detectable** from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15 mag, distance (d) = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0° means the star is on the celestial equator. It is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V or V) using the distance modulus formula: `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * (1) - 5\n    *   V = **15.0**\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 15.0 is brighter than the limit of 16.5. Therefore, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15 mag, distance (d) = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 11.505 - 5\n    *   V = **21.5**\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 21.5 is much fainter than the limit of 16.5. Therefore, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15 mag, distance (d) = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 3.495 - 5\n    *   V = **13.5**\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 13.5 is brighter than the limit of 16.5. Therefore, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15 mag, distance (d) = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\n    *   V = 15 + 8.495 - 5\n    *   V = **18.5**\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 18.5 is fainter than the limit of 16.5. Therefore, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Count\n\nLet's tally the detectable stars:\n*   a) Canopus: **Yes**\n*   b) Polaris: **No**\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Yes**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **No**\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Yes**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **No**\n\nA total of **3** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
