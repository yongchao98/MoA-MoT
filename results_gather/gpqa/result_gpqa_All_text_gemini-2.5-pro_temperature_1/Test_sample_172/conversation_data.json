    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information and the Goal:**\n    *   Speed of the electron, `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`.\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 0.1 nm`.\n    *   The goal is to find the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy, `ΔE`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Relevant Physical Principle:**\n    *   The problem involves uncertainties in position and energy, which points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We can start with the position-momentum uncertainty relation:\n        `Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2`\n        where `Δp_x` is the uncertainty in the momentum along the x-direction and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`).\n    *   For the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n        `Δx * Δp_x = ħ / 2`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x):**\n    *   First, convert the uncertainty in position `Δx` to SI units (meters):\n        `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m`.\n    *   Rearrange the uncertainty principle to solve for `Δp_x`:\n        `Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        `Δp_x = (1.054 * 10^-34 J·s) / (2 * 10^-10 m) ≈ 5.27 * 10^-25 kg·m/s`.\n\n4.  **Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x):**\n    *   The relationship between energy `E` and momentum `p` is needed. We must first check if we need to use relativistic mechanics.\n    *   The speed of light `c ≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s`. The electron's speed is `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`, which is `2/3` the speed of light. Since this is a significant fraction of `c`, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n        `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c²)²`\n        where `m₀` is the rest mass of the electron.\n    *   To find the relationship between the uncertainties `ΔE` and `Δp`, we can use calculus. The uncertainty `ΔE` is related to `Δp` by:\n        `ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp`\n    *   Let's find the derivative `dE/dp` from the energy-momentum relation:\n        `d/dp(E²) = d/dp((pc)² + (m₀c²)²)`\n        `2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c²`\n        `dE/dp = (pc²) / E`\n    *   From the theory of relativity, we also know that `E = γm₀c²` and `p = γm₀v`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into our expression for `dE/dp`:\n        `dE/dp = ((γm₀v)c²) / (γm₀c²) = v`\n    *   This gives a very simple and powerful relationship: the rate of change of energy with respect to momentum is the particle's velocity. Therefore:\n        `ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   Now we can combine the results from Step 3 and Step 4:\n        `ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x`\n        `ΔE ≈ v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))`\n    *   Substitute the known values into this equation:\n        `ΔE ≈ (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (1.054 * 10^-34 J·s) / (2 * 10^-10 m)`\n    *   The '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `ΔE ≈ (10^8 m/s) * (1.054 * 10^-34 J·s) / (10^-10 m)`\n        `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^(-34 + 8 + 10) J`\n        `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^-16 J`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately `1.054 * 10^-16 J`.\n    *   This value is of the order of `10^-16 J`.\n    *   Comparing with the given options:\n        A) ~10^(-19) J\n        B) ~10^(-18) J\n        C) ~10^(-16) J\n        D) ~10^(-17) J\n    *   The result matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Relativistic Speed:** The most critical point is recognizing that the electron's speed is relativistic. Using the classical kinetic energy formula (`E = p²/2m`) would lead to an incorrect relationship between `ΔE` and `Δp` and thus an incorrect final answer.\n2.  **Uncertainty Relation:** Use the proper form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, `Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2`. Using `h` instead of `ħ` would introduce a factor of `2π` which is a significant error. Using `ħ` instead of `ħ/2` is a common approximation for order-of-magnitude estimates, but `ħ/2` is more precise for finding the *minimum* uncertainty.\n3.  **Relating Uncertainties:** The derivation `ΔE ≈ v * Δp` is a key step that simplifies the problem significantly. This relation holds for both classical and relativistic particles.\n4.  **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all values are in standard SI units (`m`, `m/s`, `J·s`) before performing calculations to get the final answer in Joules (`J`).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the minimum uncertainty in the energy is calculated to be approximately `1.054 * 10^-16 J`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
