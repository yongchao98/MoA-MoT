    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". Parallax (plx) is a measure of the apparent shift of a star against the background as the Earth orbits the Sun. The quantity \"number of stars varies with parallax\" can be interpreted as the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. In mathematical terms, this is the number of stars per unit parallax, which we can write as a proportionality:\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\nwhere `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Goal**\n\nWe need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically \"per unit range of distance, r\". This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`. Our goal is to find the proportionality between `dN/dr` and `r`.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Parallax and Distance**\n\nThere is a fundamental and simple relationship between the distance to a star (`r`) and its parallax (`plx`). They are inversely proportional. For standard astronomical units (distance in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds), the relationship is:\n\n`plx = 1/r` or equivalently `r = 1/plx`\n\n**Step 4: Use the Chain Rule to Connect the Rates**\n\nWe want to find `dN/dr`, and we know the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance**\n\nWe need to find the term `d(plx)/dr` from the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n\n`plx = r^(-1)`\n\nUsing the power rule for derivatives, `d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)`:\n\n`d(plx)/dr = -1 * r^(-1-1) = -1 * r^(-2) = -1/r^2`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute and Simplify**\n\nNow we substitute the known proportionalities and the calculated derivative back into the chain rule equation from Step 4.\n\n1.  From the given information: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n2.  From Step 5: `d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2`\n\nSo, `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\nNow, we must express everything in terms of distance, `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n\n`1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\nSubstitute this back into our proportionality:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\n`dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n\n`dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\n**Step 7: Interpret the Final Result**\n\nThe result `dN/dr ∝ -r^3` tells us how the number of stars per unit distance changes with distance. The negative sign indicates that for a fixed interval of distance (e.g., between 100 and 101 parsecs vs. 1000 and 1001 parsecs), you find fewer stars at greater distances, which is physically sensible. The question asks for the proportionality of how it changes, which is related to the magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^3`.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"varies with\":** Correctly interpreting \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" as a rate, `dN/d(plx)`, is the most critical step.\n*   **Target Quantity:** Recognizing that \"number of stars... per unit range of distance, r\" means finding the rate `dN/dr`.\n*   **Parallax-Distance Relation:** Remembering the inverse relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n*   **Chain Rule:** Applying the chain rule correctly is the key mathematical tool for this problem.\n*   **Derivatives:** Correctly calculating the derivative `d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`.\n*   **Significance of the Negative Sign:** The negative sign in the final answer is physically meaningful but does not affect the power of `r` in the proportionality, which is what the question is about.\n\n<<<A>>>"
