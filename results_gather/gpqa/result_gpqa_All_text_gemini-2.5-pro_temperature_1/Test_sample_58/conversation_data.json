    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions that occur when the three solutions are mixed.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their properties.**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid. It does not fully dissociate in water.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid. It completely dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base. It completely dissociates into Ba2+ and OH- ions. Note that one mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH- ions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial number of moles of each substance.**\nThe number of moles is calculated using the formula: Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles of CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of HCl:**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles of HCl\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2:**\n    0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles of Ba(OH)2\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total moles of acidic protons (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).**\n*   **Moles of H+ from the strong acid (HCl):**\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely.\n    Moles of H+ = Moles of HCl = 0.080 moles.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from the strong base (Ba(OH)2):**\n    Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that yields two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-), we must multiply its moles by 2.\n    Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n*   **Moles of acidic protons from the weak acid (CH3COOH):**\n    We have 0.050 moles of the weak acid CH3COOH.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe strong base (OH-) will react completely with any available acid, prioritizing the strong acid's H+ ions first, followed by the weak acid's protons.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Base vs. Strong Acid**\n    The 0.180 moles of OH- will first react with the 0.080 moles of H+ from HCl.\n    OH- (initial) = 0.180 mol\n    H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    The strong acid is the limiting reactant in this step.\n    Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    The remaining 0.100 moles of OH- will then react with the 0.050 moles of the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n    OH- (remaining) = 0.100 mol\n    CH3COOH (initial) = 0.050 mol\n    The weak acid is the limiting reactant in this step. All of it will be consumed.\n    Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess amount of OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the final solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions:**\n    [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH-]\n    pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
