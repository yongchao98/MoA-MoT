    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (from NaCN) and a hydroxyl group to the carbonyl carbon. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (⁻CN) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   The π-bond of the carbonyl group (C=O) breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   Structure of the intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has a neutral hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. This is typically achieved by adding an acid in a workup step.\n    *   **H₃O⁺** (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic solution (e.g., from adding HCl or H₂SO₄ to water). It is a standard reagent for protonating intermediates in an acidic workup.\n    *   **NaHSO₃** (sodium bisulfite) is a reagent used for forming bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones. It is not the correct reagent for protonating the alkoxide to form a cyanohydrin.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reagent A:** The correct reagent to complete the cyanohydrin formation is an acid source. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule remains unchanged. This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be performed under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating. The presence of water (H₂O) is essential for the hydrolysis.\n    *   The problem shows the direct formation of the carboxylic acid (-COOH), which is characteristic of **acid-catalyzed hydrolysis**. (Base-catalyzed hydrolysis would first yield a carboxylate salt, -COO⁻, which would then require a separate acidification step to form the carboxylic acid).\n    *   The catalyst (Reagent B) facilitates the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent B must be a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **HCl** (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a very common and effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can act as a proton source, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile, a reaction that typically requires harsh conditions.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reagent B:** A strong acid is needed for this transformation. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent A should be **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent B should be **HCl**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n*   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect A)\n*   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n*   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect A and B)\n\n<<<C>>>"
