    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for a possible energy difference between two quantum states, E1 and E2, that would allow them to be \"clearly resolved\". We are given the lifetimes of these two states. The key concept here is the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle connecting lifetime and energy is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n2.  **Interpretation:** In this context, Δt is the lifetime (τ) of the state, and ΔE is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (Γ) of the energy level. So, the minimum energy width of a state is given by Γ ≈ ħ/τ. A shorter lifetime implies a larger energy width, meaning the energy of the state is less precisely defined.\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels (or spectral lines) to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly larger than the energy widths of the individual levels (Γ1 and Γ2). Specifically, the energy separation must be greater than the width of the broader level.\n4.  **Constants and Units:** The options are given in electron-volts (eV). Therefore, it is convenient to use the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s:\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width (Γ1) of the first state.**\n*   The lifetime of the first state is τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n*   The energy width is calculated using the uncertainty principle: Γ1 ≈ ħ / τ1.\n*   Γ1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   Γ1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy width (Γ2) of the second state.**\n*   The lifetime of the second state is τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n*   The energy width is calculated as: Γ2 ≈ ħ / τ2.\n*   Γ2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   Γ2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\n*   The two energy widths are Γ1 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and Γ2 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n*   The first state has a shorter lifetime and therefore a larger energy width (Γ1 > Γ2). This larger width is the main factor limiting our ability to distinguish the two levels.\n*   For the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n*   Therefore, the condition is: |E2 - E1| > Γ1, which means |E2 - E1| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on this condition.**\n*   We are looking for an energy difference that is significantly larger than ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ eV is about 150 times larger). This separation would allow the levels to be very clearly resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is much smaller than both Γ1 and Γ2. The levels would completely overlap and be indistinguishable.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value (10⁻⁸ eV) is smaller than the larger width Γ1 (6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the levels could not be clearly resolved.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is extremely small compared to both energy widths. The levels would be completely indistinguishable.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nOnly the energy difference in option A is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>"
