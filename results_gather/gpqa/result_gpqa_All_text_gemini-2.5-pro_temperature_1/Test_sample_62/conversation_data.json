    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Model and Initial State**\n\n*   The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the **quantum rotation-vibration model**. The energy of a given state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is given by:\n    *   `E(v, J) = E_vibration + E_rotation = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`\n    *   where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   The molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**. This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   **Initial State:** (v=0, J=0)\n    *   **Initial Energy:** `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Final State and the Transition**\n\n*   The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\".\n*   For a transition to occur via the absorption of a single photon, it must obey spectroscopic **selection rules**. For a rovibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, these rules are:\n    *   `Δv = +1` (for absorption)\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`\n*   Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0):\n    *   `v` must change by +1, so the new vibrational state is `v' = 1`.\n    *   `J` must change by ±1. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`, so the new rotational state is `J' = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). This is the lowest energy transition allowed by the selection rules from the ground state.\n    *   **Final State:** (v=1, J=1)\n    *   **Final Energy:** `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\n*   The energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) is the difference between the final and initial energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n    *   `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n    *   `ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Necessary Parameters (μ, I, B)**\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Mass of proton/neutron (amu): `1 amu = 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant: `ħ = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   Speed of light: `c = 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s`\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    *   `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    *   `μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n    *   `μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    *   `R = 2 angstroms = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `I = μ * R²`\n    *   `I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    *   `B = ħ² / (2I)`\n    *   `B = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 × 10⁻²³ J`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Total Photon Energy (ΔE)**\n\n*   First, calculate the vibrational energy part `ħω`:\n    *   `ħω = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   Now, calculate the total energy `ΔE = ħω + 2B`:\n    *   `ΔE = (4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.60 × 10⁻²³ J)`\n    *   `ΔE = (4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.0092 × 10⁻²⁰ J)`\n    *   `ΔE ≈ 4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    *   *(Careful point: Notice that the rotational energy term `2B` is much smaller than the vibrational energy term `ħω`, which is typical.)*\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Photon's Momentum**\n\n*   The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) by the equation `E = pc`.\n*   `p = ΔE / c`\n*   `p = (4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s)`\n*   `p ≈ 1.408 × 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s` or `N·s`\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\n*   The calculated momentum is approximately `1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N*s\n    *   B) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N*s\n    *   C) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N*s\n    *   D) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N*s\n*   The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
