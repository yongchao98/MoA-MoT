    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** The problem assumes that stars are spread out evenly throughout three-dimensional space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant. `ρ = (Number of Stars) / (Volume) = constant`.\n*   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a more distant star.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". In mathematical terms, this is the derivative of the number of stars `N` with respect to parallax `plx`, which is written as `dN/d(plx)`. We need to find how this quantity is proportional to `plx`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Number of Stars to Distance**\n\nConsider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth). The volume of this sphere is:\n`V(d) = (4/3) * π * d³`\n\nSince the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N(d)` within this sphere (i.e., at a distance less than or equal to `d`) is:\n`N(d) = ρ * V(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n**Step 3: Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell of Space**\n\nNow, let's consider a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n*   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n*   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density `ρ` multiplied by the shell's volume `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\nThis equation tells us how many stars are found in the small distance range between `d` and `d + dd`.\n\n**Step 4: Convert from Distance to Parallax**\n\nOur goal is to find the relationship in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). We need to substitute `d` and `dd` with their equivalents in `plx`.\n\n*   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n*   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute and Find the Final Relationship**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN` from Step 3:\n`dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n`dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ((-1/plx²) * d(plx))`\n\nLet's simplify this:\n`dN = -4πρ * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n`dN = -4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\nTo find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n`dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars in a given range must be positive, so we are interested in the magnitude. The negative sign simply arises because distance `d` and parallax `plx` are inversely related (as one increases, the other decreases).\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n`|dN/d(plx)| ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Assumption is Key:** This entire result hinges on the assumption of a uniform spatial density of stars. In reality, stars are concentrated in the disk and bulge of our galaxy, so this model is a simplification.\n2.  **Cumulative vs. Differential:** It's important not to confuse the *total* number of stars out to a certain distance (`N`) with the number of stars *in a specific range* (`dN`). The question asks for the latter, which requires differentiation.\n3.  **Inverse Relationship:** The inverse relationship between distance and parallax (`d = 1/plx`) is what introduces the higher powers of `plx` during the conversion of differentials (`dd` to `d(plx)`).\n4.  **Volume Element:** The number of stars in a distance shell `dd` scales with the volume of that shell, which is `~d² * dd`. When you convert both `d²` and `dd` to parallax, you get `(1/plx)²` and `(1/plx²) d(plx)` respectively, leading to the `1/plx⁴` dependence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
