    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings (C6H5-X). The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the nature of the substituent 'X'. The question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\nSubstituents can be classified into two main categories based on their directing effects:\n1.  **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups -R) or halogens (-Cl). For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product.\n2.  **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR). For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents in the Given Substances\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n*   **1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Sorting into Two Groups\n\nSince meta-directors yield very little para product and ortho, para-directors yield a significant amount of para product, we can immediately say that all meta-directing substances will have a lower para yield than all ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (Meta-Directors):** {C6H5-NO2 (4), C6H5-COOH (6), C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)}\n*   **High Para Yield Group (Ortho, Para-Directors):** {C6H5-CH3 (1), C6H5-C2H5 (5), C6H5-Cl (3)}\n\nThe final order will be: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}\n\n### Step 4: Arrange the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus forming even less para product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n*   The -COOH group is the next strongest deactivator.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 5: Arrange the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. A higher para yield is favored by factors that disfavor substitution at the ortho position.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The bulky incoming electrophile (Br+) will have difficulty approaching the ortho positions if the substituent is also bulky.\n    *   Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5): The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). The greater steric hindrance of the ethyl group leads to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects of Halogens:**\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3): The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This effect is stronger at the ortho positions than at the more distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with sterics, makes the para position much more favored for halogens compared to alkyl groups. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is known to be very high (around 89%). This is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest in this group.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: -CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl.\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Groups for the Final Answer\n\nCombining the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n\nThe group of meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) has a lower para yield than the group of ortho, para-directors (1 < 5 < 3).\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
