    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided about the compound.**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I) is present.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a plausible chemical structure.**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, one substituent is a halogen (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group).\n*   The most common and stable functional group that fits the \"2 carbons and a C=O\" description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a halogen on the ring, a carbonyl group, and is di-substituted. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons on the ring. The splitting pattern of these protons depends on the positions of the substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n*   The options provided (especially C and D) show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H). This highly symmetric pattern is characteristic of **para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution)**. In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each proton has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in two doublets.\n*   Let's assume the compound is **para-haloacetophenone**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):**\n    *   There will be 4 aromatic protons in total.\n    *   They will appear as two signals because of the ring's symmetry.\n    *   Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so the protons will be deshielded and appear downfield (typically between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm).\n    *   We expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For example: δ ≈ 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and δ ≈ 7.6 ppm (2H, d).\n*   **Aliphatic Protons (on the substituents):**\n    *   The only aliphatic protons are on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent (-COCH3).\n    *   This methyl group has 3 protons, so its signal will integrate to 3H.\n    *   It is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will not be split, appearing as a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm. We expect a signal like: δ ≈ 2.3 ppm (3H, s).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option shows only 1 proton in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the expected signal for an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   This option is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). If the compound were an aldehyde (e.g., para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO), the aldehyde proton would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 protons, appearing as a triplet, not a singlet. Similarly, the CH2 protons would appear as a doublet, not a singlet. The multiplicities in this option are inconsistent with a plausible structure. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only NMR data that matches the deductions from the molecular formula and FTIR data is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
