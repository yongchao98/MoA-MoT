    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial acetic acid solution is diluted with water. The concentration used for the titration calculation must be the new, diluted concentration.\n2.  **Reaction:** This is a titration of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) with a strong base (NaOH). The products are water and the conjugate base of the weak acid (CH₃COO⁻, as sodium acetate).\n3.  **25% Titration Point:** This point is in the buffer region, where both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) are present in significant amounts. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate here.\n4.  **Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water. The pH will be greater than 7.\n5.  **Constants:** We need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid to find the pKa for the buffer calculation and the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the conjugate base hydrolysis calculation. Kb can be found using the relation Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (HAc):\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol HAc.\n*   Total volume after dilution:\n    V_total = V_acid + V_water = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    [HAc] = Moles / V_total = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq).**\nAt the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of HAc.\n*   Moles of NaOH = Moles of HAc = 0.00100 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH (V_eq) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = **10.00 cm³**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added, or 25% of the initial moles of HAc has reacted.\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.25 × 0.00100 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n*   The reaction is: HAc + OH⁻ → Ac⁻ + H₂O\n*   Moles of HAc remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.00100 mol - 0.00025 mol = **0.00075 mol**.\n*   Moles of Ac⁻ (conjugate base) formed = Moles of NaOH added = **0.00025 mol**.\n\nNow, we have a buffer solution. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ( [Ac⁻] / [HAc] )\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   The ratio of concentrations [Ac⁻]/[HAc] is the same as the ratio of their moles, since they are in the same volume.\n    Ratio = 0.00025 mol / 0.00075 mol = 1/3.\n*   Calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all 0.00100 mol of HAc has been converted to 0.00100 mol of its conjugate base, Ac⁻.\n*   Total volume of the solution = Initial volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    V_total = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   Concentration of the conjugate base, [Ac⁻]:\n    [Ac⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.020 M**.\n\nThe acetate ion (Ac⁻) hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\nAc⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HAc + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Set up an ICE table to find [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n    x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n*   Calculate pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
