    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics Principles\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ_proper)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ_proper` is the mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab/detector frame). The mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n3.  **Travel Time:** The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the detector. The distance they travel is the radius `R`. Since they move at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time taken for this journey in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nThe fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N(t_lab) / N₀`. The time `t` in the decay law must be the time elapsed in the lab frame, `t_lab`, but the lifetime `τ` must be the lifetime as observed in the lab frame, `τ_lab`.\n\nFraction surviving, `F = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n*   `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n*   `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nSo, the fraction of particles reaching the detector is:\n`F = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Two Scenarios\n\nLet's define a constant `K = (R / c) / τ_proper`. This constant depends on the detector's radius and the particle's intrinsic properties, which do not change between the two scenarios.\nThe equation simplifies to: `F = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `F₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n*   Fraction surviving, `F₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the same equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\nWe now have two expressions for the same constant `K`. We can set them equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\nLet's use the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The actual radius of the detector (30 m) and the speed of light (c) are not needed for the final calculation because they are part of a constant factor that gets canceled out.\n*   The \"ultra-relativistic\" approximation (`v ≈ c`) is crucial and simplifies the travel time calculation.\n*   The distinction between proper time (`τ_proper`) and lab time (`τ_lab`) is the core of the problem. Time dilation is what allows more particles to reach the detector at higher energies (higher γ).\n*   To get a larger fraction of particles to survive, they need to experience less time decay from the lab's perspective. This is achieved by increasing the time dilation effect, which requires a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ > γ₁` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\nThe calculated value of `γ₂` is approximately 54, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
