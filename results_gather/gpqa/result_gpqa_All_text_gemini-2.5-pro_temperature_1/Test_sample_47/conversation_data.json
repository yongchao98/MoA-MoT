    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents acting on an α-halo ketone is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. In this reaction, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon that does not bear the halogen (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon with the bromine atom (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone ring.\n    4.  The ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, which is then protonated (upon workup) to yield a carboxylic acid. The result is a ring contraction.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Note:** While an elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, the subsequent reaction steps are much more consistent with the Favorskii rearrangement pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the ring carbon attached to it (C1), and bisects the bond between the two furthest carbons (C3 and C4).\n\nLet's count the sets of chemically equivalent hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the hydrogen on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens (a CH₂ group) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. One hydrogen is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group and the other is \"trans\". The two \"cis\" hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two \"trans\" hydrogens are also equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens from these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The two \"cis\" hydrogens (on C3 and C4) are equivalent, and the two \"trans\" hydrogens are equivalent. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the different types of hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (C2/C5 H's) + 2 (C3/C4 H's) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
