    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information Given\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the question.\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds in the mixture have the molecular formula C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n2.  **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All of them have the formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5. This plane makes C1 and C3 equivalent, and C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes C1 equivalent to C4, C2 equivalent to C3, and C5 equivalent to C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Since equivalent protons do not split each other, they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This will result in a **quartet** (4H total) and a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Summary (1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from the possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mixture Based on the Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option, remembering the mixture is 1:1.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have up to five signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap). This does not match the observation of three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both Durene (1,2,4,5-) and Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-) give one 2H singlet each. In a 1:1 mixture, this will produce **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will therefore show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), unless the two 3H signals from Isodurene happen to have the same chemical shift. This is chemically unlikely and doesn't provide as direct a fit as option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)** is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (1s, 2H) + Prehnitene (1s, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. **(Correct)**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (1s, 12H) + Prehnitene (2s, 6H + 6H) -> 3 singlets, 12H:6H:6H or 2:1:1 ratio. **(Correct)**\n\nThus, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
