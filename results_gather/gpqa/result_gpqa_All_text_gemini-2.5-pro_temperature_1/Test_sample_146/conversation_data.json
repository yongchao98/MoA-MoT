    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Process:** The reaction is a proton-antiproton annihilation: $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information that implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the annihilation happens with both the proton and antiproton effectively at rest.\n*   **Frame of Reference:** This setup means we are working in the center-of-mass frame.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation is zero (since the particles are at rest). Therefore, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\n\n*   The energy in the initial state is purely the rest mass energy of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n*   Total initial energy, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since they are likely a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass. The problem gives this mass as $m_A$.\n*   Rest mass energy of particle A is given: $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   The total initial energy of 1876.6 MeV is converted into the total energy of these four A particles.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero) and the symmetry of the problem, the available energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle will have the same energy, $E_A$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy of a Single Particle A**\n\n*   The total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n*   Using conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n*   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n*   Solving for $E_A$: $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   This value, $E_A$, is the total relativistic energy of a single particle A, which includes both its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy.\n\n**5. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\n*   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We can find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n*   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n*   Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n*   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$.\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **\"Slowly moving\"**: This phrase is critical. It simplifies the initial state by allowing the assumption of zero initial kinetic energy and zero total momentum.\n2.  **Relativistic vs. Classical**: The energies involved are significantly higher than the rest mass energies, and the resulting velocity is a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Relativistic formulas must be used.\n3.  **Energy Distribution**: In the center-of-mass frame, the energy must be distributed equally among the identical final particles due to symmetry and momentum conservation.\n4.  **Energy Types**: It is important to distinguish between rest mass energy ($mc^2$) and total relativistic energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$). The energy from the annihilation provides the final particles with both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.\n\nThe calculated velocity of approximately 0.77c matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
