    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance X and related compounds from the clues.**\n\n*   **Clue Analysis:** The problem describes a series of chemical reactions and properties to identify an unknown substance, X.\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (general formula R-CO-COOH) contains at least 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the oxygen count to 2 implies a strong reduction. For example, the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH2OH) results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This points towards a powerful reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4).\n    *   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" This suggests that X is an isotopically labeled version of a common reagent. Given the analog is likely LiAlH4, the heavier isotope is probably deuterium (D or ²H) replacing hydrogen (H). This makes **Substance X = LiAlD4** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y... with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Hydrides like LiAlD4 react violently with protic solvents like water. Let's identify Y and W. The reaction produces hydrogen gas. If Y were regular water (H2O), the gas would be a mix including HD (2 protons, 1 neutron), which does not fit the description. If **liquid Y is heavy water (D2O)**, the reaction is LiAlD4 + 4 D2O → LiOD + Al(OD)3 + 4 D2. The gas released, **W = D2**, fits the description perfectly: a deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\" In the reaction above, the precipitate **G is Al(OD)3** (Aluminum deuteroxide). When heated, Al(OD)3 decomposes: 2 Al(OD)3 → Al2O3 + 3 D2O. The released substance **B is D2O**. The melting point of D2O is 276.97 K, which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Identification:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD4**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X.**\n\n*   Substance X is LiAlD4.\n*   The elements present in the molecule are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on the periodic table (atomic number):\n    *   Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the molecule of X. This means summing the mass of all hydrogen atoms (isotopes) and all aluminum atoms.\n*   We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes, which is standard for this type of problem.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   The most common and stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule LiAlD4 contains four atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Mass = 4 × (mass of one D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule LiAlD4 contains one atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Mass = 1 × (mass of one Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Total Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Total Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
