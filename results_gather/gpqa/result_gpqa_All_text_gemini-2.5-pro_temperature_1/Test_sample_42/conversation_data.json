    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Functional Group:** Among the given groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy), the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. We will assign the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group as position 1 (C1).\n3.  **Place Substituents Relative to C1:**\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are **meta** to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. The description also states they are meta to each other, which is consistent with placing them at C3 and C5. Let's tentatively place -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, one group is at C2 and the other at C6.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **para** to the carboxylic acid. The para position is C4.\n4.  **Refine the Structure with the Final Clue:**\n    *   The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   We placed the nitrile (-CN) at C5. The ortho positions relative to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This fixes the position of the -OH group at C6. Consequently, the dimethylamino group must be at the other ortho position to the carboxylic acid, which is C2.\n\n**The final, unambiguous structure is:**\n*   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n*   C3: -CHO (Formyl)\n*   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n*   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n*   C6: -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n**Step 2: Number the Benzene Ring**\n\n1.  The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is **C1**.\n2.  We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (positions) to the other substituents.\n3.  Let's check the two possible numbering directions:\n    *   **Clockwise:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n4.  Since both directions yield the same lowest locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: The numbering is chosen that gives the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n5.  Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n6.  The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". Let's find its position in both numbering schemes:\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** The -CN group is at C5.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** The -CN group is at C3.\n7.  Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise numbering is correct.**\n\n**The correct numbering of the substituents is:**\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\n1.  List the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants.\n2.  Combine them before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **c**yano: **3-cyano**\n*   **d**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **f**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n*   **h**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n*   **m**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nPutting them together in alphabetical order (c, d, f, h, m):\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   C) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** (Matches our derived name)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
