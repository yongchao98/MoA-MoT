    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Solar Neutrino Sources and their Energies\nThe Sun produces neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain and, to a lesser extent, the CNO cycle. The pp chain has three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. We need to know which reactions produce neutrinos and at what energies.\n\n*   **pp-I Branch:**\n    *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νe` (pp neutrinos): Produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with a maximum energy of 0.42 MeV (420 keV).\n*   **pp-II Branch:**\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe` (⁷Be neutrinos): Produces mono-energetic (line spectrum) neutrinos, predominantly at **0.861 MeV (861 keV)** (90% of the time) and a weaker line at 0.384 MeV (384 keV).\n*   **pp-III Branch:**\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe` (⁸B neutrinos): Produces a continuous, high-energy spectrum of neutrinos with a maximum energy of about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:**\n    *   This cycle also produces neutrinos, notably from ¹³N decay (max energy 1.20 MeV) and ¹⁵O decay (max energy 1.73 MeV). These are continuous spectra. The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's energy production but its neutrinos are important in certain energy ranges.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\nThe problem states two key conditions:\n1.  **The pp-III branch suddenly stopped.** The defining neutrino-producing step of the pp-III branch is the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B). Therefore, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos instantly drops to zero at the source.\n2.  **This happened about 8.5 minutes ago.** Since neutrinos travel from the Sun to the Earth in about 8.5 minutes, we are observing the effects of this change *right now*. This means the flux of ⁸B neutrinos reaching Earth is currently zero.\n3.  **All other reactions remained as they were.** This means the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle reactions continue to produce neutrinos as usual.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Neutrino Flux in Each Energy Band *After* the Change\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio: Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV) / Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV).\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** Max energy is 420 keV. They do not contribute.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** These are line spectra at 384 keV and 861 keV. They do not fall within the 700-800 keV range.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** This was a major contributor, but its flux is now zero.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Yes. The continuous spectra from both ¹³N decay (up to 1.2 MeV) and ¹⁵O decay (up to 1.73 MeV) contribute flux in this energy band.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** After the change, the only significant source of neutrinos in this band is the **CNO cycle**.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** No contribution.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** Yes! The very strong, mono-energetic line at **861 keV** falls directly within this band. This neutrino comes from the pp-II branch, which is unaffected. This is the dominant contributor to this band.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** Flux is now zero.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Yes, the CNO cycle also contributes a small amount of flux in this band.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is composed of the very strong ⁷Be line plus a small background from the CNO cycle. The flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the **861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos**.\n\n### Step 4: Estimate the Ratio of the Fluxes\n\nThe ratio we need to calculate is:\nRatio = Flux_after(700-800 keV) / Flux_after(800-900 keV)\n\nBased on our analysis in Step 3:\nRatio ≈ (Flux from CNO cycle in a 100 keV band) / (Total Flux from the 861 keV ⁷Be line)\n\nLet's use approximate values from the Standard Solar Model:\n*   Total flux of 861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos: F(⁷Be) ≈ 5 × 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n*   Total flux of neutrinos from the main CNO reactions (¹³N and ¹⁵O): F(CNO) ≈ 5 × 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n\nThe CNO neutrino spectrum is continuous and spread out over an energy range of more than 1 MeV. The flux in the specific 100 keV band (700-800 keV) will be only a fraction of the total CNO flux. As a rough order-of-magnitude estimate, let's say about 1/10th of the CNO flux falls in this band.\n*   Flux(CNO in Band 1) ≈ (1/10) * F(CNO) ≈ (1/10) * 5 × 10⁸ = 5 × 10⁷ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio:\nRatio ≈ Flux(CNO in Band 1) / F(⁷Be)\nRatio ≈ (5 × 10⁷) / (5 × 10⁹)\nRatio ≈ 1 × 10⁻² = 0.01\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   The 8.5-minute timing is crucial, confirming we see the effect of the change now.\n*   Stopping pp-III specifically means the ⁸B neutrino flux vanishes.\n*   The key is to correctly identify the *remaining* sources in each band.\n*   Band 1 is left with only the faint, continuous CNO spectrum.\n*   Band 2 is dominated by the intense, mono-energetic ⁷Be line from the unaffected pp-II branch.\n*   The final calculation compares a small fraction of the total CNO flux to the total ⁷Be line flux, resulting in a ratio of approximately 10⁻².\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.01. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
