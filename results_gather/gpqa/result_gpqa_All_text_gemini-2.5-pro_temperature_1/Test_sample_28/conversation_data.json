    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most effective mutation.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a specific gene. To do this, we need to inactivate the protein that this gene encodes. The most effective way to inactivate a protein is to prevent its correct and full-length synthesis. We need to find the mutation that is *most likely* to cause a complete loss of function of the protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. In molecular biology, `ATG` is the standard start codon, which signals the beginning of protein translation and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The protein is built by reading the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons.\nThe initial reading frame is:\n`ATG` (Methionine - START)\n`TTT` (Phenylalanine)\n`CTC` (Leucine)\n`GCT` (Alanine)\n`GGT` (Glycine)\n...and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant for its Effect on the Protein**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, and `CTC` is changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` (Phenylalanine) -> `TTC` (Phenylalanine): This is a **silent mutation**; the amino acid does not change.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**; it substitutes one amino acid for another.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This mutation results in a full-length protein with only one amino acid changed. While this *could* potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to inactivate it. Many single amino acid changes have little to no effect.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the ribosome to stop translation prematurely.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. This will produce a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine) instead of the full-length functional protein. This is almost certain to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...` (Note: a `T` is inserted between `TTT` and `C` from `CTC`)\n    *   **Change:** A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the three-letter reading frame for all subsequent codons. The new amino acid sequence will be completely different from the original from that point onwards.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A frameshift mutation early in a gene is extremely likely to produce a non-functional protein. The altered sequence often creates a premature stop codon by chance a short distance downstream. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   **Change:** A comparison shows that `CTC` has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation, as in Mutant 1) and the `GGT` codon has been deleted entirely.\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides, which removes one amino acid without shifting the reading frame) combined with a missense mutation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A nearly full-length protein is produced that is simply missing one amino acid (Glycine) and has another changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). Like the missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Select the Best Candidate**\nWe are looking for the mutation *most likely* to eliminate the compound.\n*   **Low Probability:** Mutant 1 (missense) and Mutant 4 (in-frame deletion) produce a protein that is still mostly intact. Their ability to knock out function is uncertain.\n*   **High Probability:** Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are both highly effective at creating non-functional proteins.\n*   **Final Choice:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a definitive \"STOP\" signal for protein synthesis right at the beginning of the gene. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional peptide. This is arguably the most direct and certain method of gene inactivation among the given choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
