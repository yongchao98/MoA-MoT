    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Core Concept: Spontaneously Broken Symmetry (SBS)\n\n1.  **Definition:** Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking occurs when the fundamental laws governing a system (e.g., its Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) possess a certain symmetry, but the system's ground state (the state of lowest energy, or vacuum) does not exhibit that symmetry.\n2.  **Key Consequence (Goldstone's Theorem):** When a *continuous* global symmetry is spontaneously broken, the theory must contain massless (or, in some cases, nearly massless) particles. These particles are called **Nambu-Goldstone bosons** (or simply Goldstone bosons). They correspond to the long-wavelength fluctuations of the system along the directions of the broken symmetry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option\n\nWe will examine each particle and identify the symmetry (if any) that is spontaneously broken to produce it as a Goldstone boson.\n\n1.  **B) Phonon:**\n    *   **System:** A crystal lattice (a solid).\n    *   **Symmetry:** The underlying laws of physics (electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) are invariant under continuous translations in space. Any position is as good as any other.\n    *   **Ground State:** The atoms in a crystal form a regular, periodic lattice. This lattice structure is *not* invariant under continuous translations; it is only invariant under a set of discrete translations that move one lattice point to another.\n    *   **Broken Symmetry:** The continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken down to a discrete translational symmetry.\n    *   **Associated Particle:** According to Goldstone's theorem, there must be Goldstone bosons. The long-wavelength acoustic **phonons** are precisely these Goldstone bosons. They represent the collective vibrations of the lattice.\n\n2.  **C) Pion:**\n    *   **System:** Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force.\n    *   **Symmetry:** In the limit where the up and down quarks are massless, the QCD Lagrangian has an approximate \"chiral symmetry\" known as SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R.\n    *   **Ground State:** The QCD vacuum is not empty; it is filled with a \"quark condensate.\" This condensate is not invariant under the full chiral symmetry group.\n    *   **Broken Symmetry:** The chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down to a smaller symmetry group, SU(2)_V (isospin symmetry).\n    *   **Associated Particle:** The Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry are the three **pions** (π+, π-, π⁰). Because the quarks have a small but non-zero mass, the initial symmetry is not exact, and the pions are not perfectly massless. They are called \"pseudo-Goldstone bosons,\" but their existence is a direct consequence of SBS.\n\n3.  **D) Magnon:**\n    *   **System:** A ferromagnet.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The interactions between electron spins in a ferromagnetic material (e.g., the Heisenberg model) are typically rotationally invariant. There is no preferred direction for the spins to align.\n    *   **Ground State:** Below a certain critical temperature (the Curie temperature), the spins spontaneously align in a single, common direction to minimize energy. This ground state picks a specific direction, breaking the rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Broken Symmetry:** The continuous rotational symmetry (SO(3)) is spontaneously broken.\n    *   **Associated Particle:** The Goldstone bosons are the collective excitations of this ordered spin system, known as spin waves. The quantum of a spin wave is the **magnon**.\n\n4.  **A) Skyrmion:**\n    *   **System:** The Skyrme model is an effective theory of pions (which, as we saw, are themselves Goldstone bosons).\n    *   **Nature of the Particle:** A Skyrmion is not a fundamental particle or a simple quantum of a field. It is a **topological soliton**. A soliton is a stable, localized, particle-like wave packet. Its stability is not due to a conservation law in the usual sense, but due to the topology of the field configuration.\n    *   **Relation to SBS:** Skyrmions arise in theories that have spontaneously broken symmetries. The Skyrme model, which describes interacting pions, is such a theory. The stability of the Skyrmion is tied to the topology of the space of possible ground states (the vacuum manifold), which is determined by the pattern of symmetry breaking. However, the Skyrmion is *not* the Goldstone boson itself. It is a complex, non-perturbative configuration of the Goldstone boson fields (the pions).\n    *   **Distinction:** While Phonons, Pions, and Magnons are all direct examples of Goldstone bosons—the universal consequence of breaking a continuous symmetry—the Skyrmion is a different kind of object. It's a non-perturbative, topological excitation that exists *within* a theory of Goldstone bosons, but it is not a Goldstone boson.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Phonons, Pions, and Magnons are all examples of (pseudo-)Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are the characteristic particles that arise directly from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.\n*   A Skyrmion is a topological soliton. While it is associated with a theory that exhibits SBS, it is not the Goldstone boson itself. It represents a different class of physical phenomenon.\n*   Therefore, the Skyrmion is the particle in the list that is not a Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
