    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Define Mean Free Path (λ)**\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between consecutive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area around a target particle within which a collision will occur.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the situation for λ₁**\n*   λ₁ is defined as the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves before the electron beam is turned on.\n*   In this case, the moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules.\n*   The number density of the target gas molecules is `n_gas`.\n*   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_gas-gas`. This cross-section is primarily determined by the physical size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces).\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ₁ is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the situation for λ₂**\n*   λ₂ is defined as the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. This occurs when the electron beam is on.\n*   In this case, the moving particles are electrons from the beam, and the target particles are the stationary gas molecules.\n*   The number density of the target gas molecules, `n_gas`, remains the same because the pressure, volume, and temperature of the compartment have not changed.\n*   The collision cross-section is now for an electron colliding with a gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_electron-gas`.\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ₂ is:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_electron-gas)**\nThe key to comparing λ₁ and λ₂ is to compare their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n*   **σ_gas-gas:** This represents a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-range and can be approximated as a \"billiard ball\" collision. The effective area for collision is related to the physical diameter of the molecules.\n\n*   **σ_electron-gas:** This represents a collision between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral particle (the gas molecule). Even though a gas molecule is neutral overall, it consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud. The strong electric field of the passing high-energy electron can interact with the molecule from a much greater distance than another neutral molecule could. This electrostatic interaction (Coulomb scattering) can easily polarize the gas molecule and deflect the electron. This long-range electrostatic interaction makes the effective target area for a collision much larger.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** Because the electron's charge allows it to interact with gas molecules from a much larger distance, the collision cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule is significantly larger than the cross-section for two gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂**\nWe know that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ).\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\nSince `σ_electron-gas` is larger than `σ_gas-gas`, the denominator in the expression for λ₂ is larger than the denominator in the expression for λ₁. A larger denominator results in a smaller value.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that λ₂ is smaller than λ₁. An electron is much more likely to collide with a gas molecule over a given distance than another gas molecule is, resulting in a shorter mean free path for the electron.\n\nThe other options involving the number 1.22 are likely distractors, possibly referencing the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution (1.22λ/D), which is not relevant to the calculation of mean free path in this context.\n\n<<<A>>>"
