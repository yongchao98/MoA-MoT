    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the System and Key Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A crucial rule for identical fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** For a particle in a 1D well, the state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**2. Determine the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by the formula:\n    `E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)`.\n*   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    `E_n = n² * E`\n*   So, the first few energy levels are:\n    *   `E₁ = 1² * E = 1E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2² * E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3² * E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4² * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n**3. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle to Fill the Levels**\n\n*   According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of **two** fermions: one with spin-up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin-down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n\n**4. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with our four fermions.\n    *   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1E):** We can place two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 4E):** We can place the remaining two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    `E_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂)`\n    `E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)`\n    `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**5. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**\n\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. We can find this by taking the ground state configuration and promoting one particle to the lowest available empty state.\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n    *   **Excitation:** The highest energy particle is in the n=2 level. The lowest available empty level is n=3. We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)`\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n    `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**6. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest one.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E (Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2)\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3)\n*   Let's consider other possible excited configurations and their energies:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 (instead of from n=2 to n=3).\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`\n*   Comparing the energies of the excited states we've found: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...\n*   The lowest excited state energy is 15E.\n*   The second lowest excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 15E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
