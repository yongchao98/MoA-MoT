    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Chirality:** The carbon at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n*   **Racemic Mixture:** \"Racemic\" means we have a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's denote them as **R_alkene** and **S_alkene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with Grubbs catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis. For a single terminal alkene like this one, it undergoes self-metathesis.\n*   **General Equation:** The self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (represented as G-CH=CH₂) proceeds as follows:\n    2 G-CH=CH₂  ⇌  G-CH=CH-G + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n*   **Our Specific Reaction:** In our case, the group 'G' is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). The question asks for the number of products excluding ethene, so we need to analyze the stereochemistry of the main product, G-CH=CH-G.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\nThe product G-CH=CH-G has the structure:\n(CH₃CH₂)(CH₃)CH-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Products**\nSince the starting material is a racemic mixture of **R_alkene** and **S_alkene**, three different reaction pairings are possible:\n1.  **R_alkene + R_alkene:** This reaction connects two (R)-chiral groups. The product will have the (3R, 6R) configuration.\n2.  **S_alkene + S_alkene:** This reaction connects two (S)-chiral groups. The product will have the (3S, 6S) configuration.\n3.  **R_alkene + S_alkene:** This cross-reaction connects one (R) group and one (S) group, leading to a (3R, 6S) configuration.\n\nNow, we must consider the geometry of the newly formed double bond (C4=C5), which can be either E (trans) or Z (cis).\n\n*   **Analysis of (3R, 6R) and (3S, 6S) products:**\n    *   The (3R, 6R) diastereomer can exist as two geometric isomers: (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene and (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Both of these molecules are chiral.\n    *   Similarly, the (3S, 6S) diastereomer gives two chiral isomers: (E)-(3S, 6S) and (Z)-(3S, 6S).\n    *   The (E)-(3S, 6S) isomer is the enantiomer of the (E)-(3R, 6R) isomer.\n    *   The (Z)-(3S, 6S) isomer is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(3R, 6R) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the homodimerization reactions (R+R and S+S) produce a total of **4 distinct chiral stereoisomers**.\n\n*   **Analysis of (3R, 6S) products:**\n    *   This diastereomer can also exist as E and Z isomers. We must check for meso compounds. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It typically possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** In this trans-isomer, the (R) group is on the opposite side of the double bond from the (S) group. This molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Inverting the (R) center gives an (S) center. Therefore, this molecule is achiral, a **meso compound**. There is only **1** such product.\n    *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** In this cis-isomer, the (R) and (S) groups are on the same side. This molecule has a C2 axis of rotation but lacks any mirror planes or inversion centers. Therefore, it is chiral. Since it is formed from a racemic mixture with an achiral catalyst, it must be produced as a racemic mixture of itself and its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This gives **2 distinct chiral stereoisomers**.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nSumming up all the possible stereoisomers:\n*   From R+R and S+S reactions: 4 chiral products (two pairs of enantiomers).\n*   From the R+S reaction: 1 achiral (meso) product and 2 chiral products (one pair of enantiomers).\n*   Total number of distinct stereoisomers = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7.\n\n**Step 6: Reconcile with the Given Options**\nThe calculated number of total stereoisomers is 7, which is not among the options (A) 8, (B) 2, (C) 6, (D) 4. This indicates that the question might be flawed or requires a specific interpretation. Let's analyze the possibilities based on the options.\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Counting Chiral Products Only.** The question might be implicitly asking for the number of *chiral* products.\n    *   Chiral products from R+R and S+S: 4\n    *   Chiral products from R+S: 2 (the Z-enantiomeric pair)\n    *   Total chiral products = 4 + 2 = 6.\n    *   This matches option (C). This interpretation acknowledges the formation of the meso compound by excluding it from the count of chiral products.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: Counting Separable Fractions (Diastereomers).** In a laboratory setting, enantiomers are not separable by standard techniques (like chromatography on a non-chiral column), so a racemic pair might be considered a single \"product\" or fraction.\n    *   Fraction 1: Racemic pair of E-(R,R) and E-(S,S).\n    *   Fraction 2: Racemic pair of Z-(R,R) and Z-(S,S).\n    *   Fraction 3: The meso compound E-(R,S), which is a diastereomer to all others.\n    *   Fraction 4: Racemic pair of Z-(R,S) and Z-(S,R).\n    *   This gives a total of 4 \"products\" or fractions. This matches option (D).\n\n**Conclusion on Interpretation**\nThe question \"How many possible products\" is ambiguous. However, counting the number of chiral stereoisomers is a common way to pose a challenging stereochemistry problem that requires identifying and distinguishing meso compounds from chiral ones. This interpretation leads directly to one of the given answers. The fact that the total number of stereoisomers is 7 (an odd number) while all options are even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) suggests that the single meso compound is meant to be treated differently. Excluding it from the count gives 6.\n\nFinal count based on the \"chiral products\" interpretation:\n- (E)-(3R, 6R) and (E)-(3S, 6S) -> 2 chiral products\n- (Z)-(3R, 6R) and (Z)-(3S, 6S) -> 2 chiral products\n- (Z)-(3R, 6S) and (Z)-(3S, 6R) -> 2 chiral products\n- Total chiral products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
