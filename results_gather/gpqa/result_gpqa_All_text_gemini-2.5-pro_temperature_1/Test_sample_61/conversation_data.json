    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to identify the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane.\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). It is a terminal alkyne.\n    *   Structure: `Cyclohexyl-C≡CH`\n\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   Let's break down the name:\n        *   The parent structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: A cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached.\n        *   At position 1 (the same carbon as the -CHO group), there is a substituent: `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This means a methyl group (-CH3) where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. The substituent is `-CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl`.\n    *   Putting it together, the structure is a cyclohexane ring bonded to both a `-CHO` group and a `-CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl` group at the same carbon atom.\n    *   Structure: `Cyclohexyl-C(CHO)-CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl`\n*   **Recognizing the Product's Origin:** This structure is a classic aldol addition product. It is formed by the reaction of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cyclohexyl-CHO`).\n    *   In an aldol reaction, one molecule of an aldehyde forms an enolate (by losing an α-hydrogen), which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    *   `Molecule 1 (enolate source)`: `Cyclohexyl-CHO` loses its α-hydrogen (the H on the carbon bearing the CHO group) to a base.\n    *   `Molecule 2 (electrophile)`: `Cyclohexyl-CHO` is attacked by the enolate.\n    *   The reaction `2 x Cyclohexyl-CHO` in the presence of a base (like `Ba(OH)2` or `NH4OH`) gives the desired final product.\n\n**2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Synthesize the intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cyclohexyl-CHO`), from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane (`Cyclohexyl-C≡CH`).\n*   **Stage 2:** Perform a self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to get the final product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it correctly executes this two-stage strategy.\n\n---\n\n**Option A: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n\n*   **Step 1 (NaNH2, methanol):** `NaNH2` is a very strong base that will deprotonate the terminal alkyne: `Cyclohexyl-C≡CH + NaNH2 → Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺`. However, adding methanol (`CH3OH`), a protic solvent, will immediately protonate the acetylide anion, regenerating the starting material: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH3OH → Cyclohexyl-C≡CH`. This first step is unproductive.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect because the first step does not lead to a useful transformation.\n\n---\n\n**Option B: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n\n*   **Step 1 (NaNH2, methyl chloride):**\n    *   `NaNH2` deprotonates ethynylcyclohexane to form the sodium cyclohexylacetylide anion (`Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺`).\n    *   This anion is a good nucleophile and reacts with methyl chloride (`CH3Cl`) in an SN2 reaction to add a methyl group.\n    *   Product: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3` (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne), an internal alkyne. This step is chemically sound.\n*   **Step 2 (H2/Pd-calcium carbonate):**\n    *   This is Lindlar's catalyst, which selectively reduces an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene (syn-hydrogenation).\n    *   Product: `(Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene` (`Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH3`). This step is also correct.\n*   **Step 3 (O3/ (CH3)2S):**\n    *   This is ozonolysis with a reductive workup (`(CH3)2S`, dimethyl sulfide). This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n    *   Cleavage of `Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH3` gives two aldehydes: `Cyclohexyl-CHO` (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and `CH3CHO` (acetaldehyde). This successfully produces the required intermediate for the next step.\n*   **Step 4 (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   `Ba(OH)2` is a base that will catalyze the aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   Reaction: `2 x Cyclohexyl-CHO` → `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This correctly forms the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B presents a complete and chemically correct pathway to the target molecule.\n\n---\n\n**Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n\n*   **Step 1 (NaNH2, methyl chloride):** Same as Option B, correctly forms `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3`.\n*   **Step 2 (H2/Pd):** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a strong hydrogenation catalyst. It will reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane, not stopping at the alkene.\n    *   Product: `Cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3` (propylcyclohexane).\n*   **Subsequent Steps:** An alkane is very unreactive. The subsequent reagents (`Ba(OH)2`, a base, or `H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O`, for alkyne hydration) will not react with propylcyclohexane to form the target product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because the second step over-reduces the alkyne.\n\n---\n\n**Option D: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n\n*   **Step 1 (NaNH2, ethyl chloride):** This sequence will add an ethyl group to the alkyne.\n    *   Product: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3` (1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne).\n*   **Step 2 (Li/liq. NH3):** This is a dissolving metal reduction that reduces an internal alkyne to a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   Product: `(E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene` (`Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH2CH3`).\n*   **Step 3 (O3/ H2O):** This is ozonolysis with an *oxidative* workup (indicated by `H2O` instead of a reducing agent like `(CH3)2S` or `Zn`). Oxidative workup converts any aldehydes formed from carbons with a hydrogen atom into carboxylic acids.\n    *   Cleavage of `Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH2CH3` would give `Cyclohexyl-COOH` (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) and `CH3CH2-COOH` (propanoic acid).\n*   **Subsequent Step:** The product is a carboxylic acid, not the required aldehyde intermediate. The aldol reaction cannot proceed from a carboxylic acid to give the target structure.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because the oxidative workup in step 3 produces a carboxylic acid instead of an aldehyde.\n\n**Final Determination**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, only Option B provides a valid and correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
