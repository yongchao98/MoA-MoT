    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n    T_eq = [ L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²) ]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   `L_star` is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationship for a Ratio:**\n    When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting the same star, most of the terms cancel out.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = { [ L_star * (1 - A4) / (16 * π * σ * a4²) ]^(1/4) } / { [ L_star * (1 - A2) / (16 * π * σ * a2²) ]^(1/4) }\n\n    *   `L_star`, `16`, `π`, and `σ` are the same for both planets and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A4 = A2`. The term `(1 - A)` also cancels out.\n\n    After cancellation, the relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ 1 / a4² ]^(1/4) / [ 1 / a2² ]^(1/4)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ a2² / a4² ]^(1/4)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(2/4)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) or √(a2 / a4)\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`T_eq ∝ 1/√a`).\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (T) using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis:\n    T² ∝ a³\n\n    We can rearrange this to express `a` in terms of `T`:\n    a ∝ T^(2/3)\n\n    Now we can write the ratio of the orbital distances (a2 / a4) in terms of their orbital periods (T2 / T4):\n    a2 / a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3)\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Ensure the exponent is correct. It is (2/3), not (3/2).\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships from Steps 3 and 4:**\n    Substitute the expression for `a2 / a4` into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (T2 / T4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n\n    Simplify the exponents by multiplying them: (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:**\n    The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\n    T1 : T2 : T3 : T4 : T5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\n    From this, we can find the specific ratio of T2 to T4:\n    T2 / T4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Be precise with which planet's period is in the numerator and which is in the denominator. The formula requires T2/T4.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Substitute the numerical value of the period ratio into the final equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    First, simplify the fraction:\n    2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4 / 7\n\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, calculate the value:\n    4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n\n    Calculating the cube root:\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8299...\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, we get ~0.83. This matches option A.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n*   Equilibrium temperature ratio: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a4)\n*   Kepler's Third Law gives the orbital distance ratio: a2 / a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3)\n*   Combining them: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3)\n*   Using given period values: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3)\n*   Calculation: (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83\n\n<<<A>>>"
