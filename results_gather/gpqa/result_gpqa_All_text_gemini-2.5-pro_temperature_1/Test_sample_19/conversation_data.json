    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided assumptions.\n\n**Goal:** Identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**Core Concept of the Impulse Approximation:** The impulse approximation simplifies a complex many-body problem (an external probe interacting with a nucleus) into a simpler, more manageable one. The central idea is to treat the interaction as if it occurs with a single, free nucleon, rather than the entire nucleus at once. The term \"impulse\" implies a very rapid interaction.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Assumption:**\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the foundational principle of the approximation. The model assumes that the incoming probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino) \"selects\" and interacts with just one nucleon. It ignores more complex scenarios where the probe's current might interact with pairs of nucleons or with the particles that mediate the nuclear force (mesons). This is called neglecting \"meson-exchange currents\" or \"two-body currents\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a necessary starting point. If the interaction wasn't with a single nucleon, the entire concept of treating *a* nucleon as \"free\" would be invalid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This assumption deals with what happens *before* and *after* the primary interaction. It posits that the incoming probe particle travels to the target nucleon without being deflected or scattered by other nucleons. Similarly, after the interaction, the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) leave the nucleus without any further interactions.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a very strong simplification. In reality, these \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) or \"initial-state interactions\" (ISI) are often significant. However, assuming transparency is crucial to making the calculation tractable and to interpreting the event as a clean, single-nucleon process. This is a key part of the *Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA)*, which is the simplest form of the impulse approximation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential for the idealized \"free nucleon\" picture to hold for the entire scattering process.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This assumption concerns the *internal structure of the nucleon itself*. The impulse approximation is a framework for dealing with the *nucleon's behavior within the nucleus*. It separates the nuclear many-body problem from the problem of the nucleon's internal structure.\n    *   **Careful Point:** One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of how the nucleon itself is modeled. You could use a non-relativistic quark model, a relativistic bag model, or even parton distribution functions (for very high energy scattering). The choice of nucleon model is a separate issue from the approximation made about its environment during the interaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself. It's a further approximation about the nucleon's structure, not its role in the nucleus.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the essence of the word \"impulse.\" An impulse in physics is a force applied over an extremely short time interval. The assumption here is that the interaction between the probe and the nucleon happens so quickly that the nucleon does not have time to interact with the other nucleons or respond to the nuclear binding potential *during* the event. It is essentially \"frozen\" in place at the moment of the collision.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This allows one to use the energy-momentum conservation laws for a two-body collision (probe + free nucleon), which vastly simplifies the kinematics. The binding energy of the nucleon is only considered *before* and *after* the collision (affecting its initial state and the final state of the residual nucleus), but not *during* the collision vertex itself.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is essential.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**\n\nTo have the impulse approximation, we need:\n*   To interact with only one nucleon (Assumption 1).\n*   For that interaction to be \"clean,\" meaning no interference from other nucleons before or after (Assumption 2).\n*   For the interaction to be so fast that the nucleon acts as if it's free from the nuclear potential *during* the collision (Assumption 4).\n\nThe assumption about the internal quark structure (Assumption 3) is a separate modeling choice and not a required part of the impulse approximation framework.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
