    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺) as the electrophile.\n*   **Substrate:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating group and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitration occurs primarily at the ortho and para positions. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para product is typically the major isomer formed.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in an acidic medium is an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the benzylic methyl group of toluene derivatives.\n*   **Plausible Products:** This oxidation can lead to either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Possibility A: Oxidation to a carboxylic acid gives p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n    *   Possibility B: Milder or more controlled oxidation gives p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   **Analysis:** We must consider the next reaction step to determine the most likely product. Step 3 involves acetone and NaOH, which are the reagents for an aldol condensation with an aldehyde or ketone. If Product 2 were a carboxylic acid, the reaction in Step 3 would be a simple acid-base reaction or a less common nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which would lead to a product whose symmetry (C₁) is not among the options. Therefore, the reaction pathway involving an aldehyde is the most plausible.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. p-Nitrobenzaldehyde (an aldehyde with no α-hydrogens) reacts with acetone (a ketone with α-hydrogens).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n    2.  The enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  An initial aldol addition product is formed, which then readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under the reaction conditions. This dehydration is favored because it creates a highly stable, extended conjugated system.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is a conjugated enone, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to its greater thermodynamic stability.\n    *   Structure: O₂N−C₆H₄−CH=CH−C(=O)−CH₃\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.**\n\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Conformation:** Due to the extensive π-conjugation (aromatic ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), the molecule adopts a largely planar conformation in its lowest energy state.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** If we consider the plane that contains all the heavy atoms (C, O, N) of the molecule, this plane acts as a mirror plane. The methyl group (-CH₃) can be oriented so that one of its C-H bonds lies within this plane, and the other two hydrogens are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane, being reflected into each other. Therefore, the molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no axis of rotation. For instance, a 180° rotation (C₂) along any axis does not result in an identical structure due to the asymmetry of the `–CH=CH–C(=O)–CH₃` chain.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. For example, the nitro group on one side does not have a corresponding nitro group on the opposite side of a central point.\n*   **Conclusion on Symmetry:** The molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule with this set of symmetry elements belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) C₂h\nB) D₂h\nC) C₃\nD) Cₛ\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
