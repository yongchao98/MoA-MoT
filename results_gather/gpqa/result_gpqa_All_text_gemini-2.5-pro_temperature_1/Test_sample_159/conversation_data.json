    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Aperture Geometry**\nThe aperture is an N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). A key piece of information is that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.\nAs the number of sides N of a regular polygon approaches infinity, the polygon itself approaches a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Fraunhofer Diffraction Theory for a Circular Aperture**\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far field known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution of this pattern is described by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\nWhere:\n*   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind, order 1.\n*   k is the wave number, defined as k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Positions of Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) in the Airy pattern occur where the intensity I(θ) is zero. This happens when the numerator of the expression is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0.\nThe minima correspond to the angles θ for which the argument of the Bessel function is equal to one of its non-zero roots. Let's denote the roots of J₁(x) = 0 as z₁, z₂, z₃, ...\n\n**Step 4: Use the Known Zeros of the Bessel Function J₁(x)**\nThe first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x) are well-established values:\n*   First root, z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second root, z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Position of the First Minimum (θ₁)**\nThe first minimum occurs when k * a * sin(θ₁) = z₁.\nUsing the given small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), this becomes:\nk * a * θ₁ ≈ z₁\n(2π/λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317\nSolving for θ₁:\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂)**\nThe second minimum occurs when k * a * sin(θ₂) = z₂.\nUsing the small angle approximation again:\nk * a * θ₂ ≈ z₂\n(2π/λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156\nSolving for θ₂:\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\nΔθ = [1.1166 * (λ/a)] - [0.6098 * (λ/a)]\nΔθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 8: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated value Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a) is closest to option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Aperture Shape:** The critical first step is realizing that an N-sided polygon with N→∞ and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n2.  **Diffraction Formula:** You must use the correct formula for a circular aperture (Airy pattern), not a single slit.\n3.  **Bessel Zeros:** The numerical values of the Bessel function zeros are required. An error here would lead to an incorrect result.\n4.  **Question Interpretation:** It is crucial to calculate the *distance between* the minima (θ₂ - θ₁), not the position of the first minimum (θ₁, which corresponds to option C) or the width of the central bright fringe (2θ₁, which corresponds to option D).\n\nFinal calculation gives 0.5068 * (λ/a), which rounds to 0.507 * (λ/a). This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
