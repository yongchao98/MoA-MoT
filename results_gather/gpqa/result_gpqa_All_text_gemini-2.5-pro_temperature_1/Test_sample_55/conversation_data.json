    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The problem describes a two-step decay process in a hydrogen atom, starting from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and ending in the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to find a valid intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path. The state is denoted by $|n, l, m\\rangle$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (electric dipole transition), the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is an energetically allowed decay, as the energy of the $n=3$ state is higher than the $n=2$ state ($E_n \\propto -1/n^2$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:**\n    *   Intermediate state: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be allowed, $-m'$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which means $m'$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three potential intermediate states identified in Step 3 can indeed decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition.\n    *   Therefore, the possible routes are:\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probability:** The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step:** We need to find the relative probability for the atom in state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay into each of the possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle n'l'm' | e\\vec{r} | nlm \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space for this state.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the available magnetic sublevels of the final state. In this case, the final state has $l'=1$, which has three sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Therefore, the transition rates to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are all equal.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible states for the first step (in the $n=2$ shell), the probability is distributed equally among them.\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is thus $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step:** Now consider the decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The only state with a lower principal quantum number that can be reached via an E1 transition is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$).\n    *   Other decays, like $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,0,0\\rangle$, are possible by selection rules, but the energy difference (the Lamb shift) is minuscule compared to the $2p \\rightarrow 1s$ energy difference. The rate is proportional to $\\omega^3$, making the $2p \\rightarrow 1s$ transition (Lyman-alpha) vastly more probable.\n    *   Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability (branching ratio) of essentially 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps.\n    *   $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Any of the three possible routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we check the given options.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our analysis. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect and there is a typo in the initial state.\n\nThe correct option describes a valid route with the calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
