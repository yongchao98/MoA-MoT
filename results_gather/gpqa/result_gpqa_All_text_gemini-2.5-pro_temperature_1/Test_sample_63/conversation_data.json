    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gas treatment process to identify the decomposition products.**\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the results from each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent (desiccant) that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means the mass of water produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to test for acidic gases, most commonly CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, it means there were no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur that would form these oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases containing oxygen, such as O₂, N₂O, or NO. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. Given that we are dealing with nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the gas mixture before it entered Tube №3.**\nThe gas entering Tube №3 was a mixture of the oxidizing gas and the inert Gas C (N₂). The reaction in Tube №3 removed 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. The gas leaving the tube was 0.10 mol of N₂. Let's consider the possible oxidizing gas.\n\nA very common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts that reacts with hot copper is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\nReaction: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂\n*   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms to form CuO, we must have started with 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   The reaction of 0.05 mol of N₂O also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The total N₂ collected at the end is 0.10 mol. This total consists of the N₂ produced in the reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was present in the original gas mixture and passed through unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - Produced N₂ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the gas mixture produced from the initial decomposition consisted of:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B was heated. Let's assume we have `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. We need to find two salts whose decomposition in a 1:1 molar ratio produces the calculated amounts of gases. Common ammonium salts that decompose into these products are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition reaction is NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The decomposition reaction is NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nIf we start with `x` moles of each:\n*   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol N₂O and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   `x` mol of N₂O\n*   `x` mol of N₂\n*   `2x + 2x = 4x` mol of H₂O\n\nComparing this to our findings from Step 2:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => `x` = 0.05\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `x` = 0.05\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => `4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent with `x = 0.05`. Therefore, the initial mixture was 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol ≈ 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol ≈ 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given total mass, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
