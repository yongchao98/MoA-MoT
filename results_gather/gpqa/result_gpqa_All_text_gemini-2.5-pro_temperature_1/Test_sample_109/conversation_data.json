    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the combined observational criteria.**\n\nFirst, we need to establish the conditions a star must meet to be observable by *both* instruments. This involves two aspects: the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) and its position in the sky (declination).\n\n*   **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17.0 (i.e., m_V < 17.0).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with m_V brighter than 16.0 (i.e., m_V < 16.0).\n    *   To be seen by both, a star must satisfy the stricter condition, which is the limit of HIRES. Therefore, the combined magnitude criterion is **m_V < 16.0**.\n\n*   **Sky Visibility (Declination):**\n    *   The visibility of a star depends on the observatory's latitude. The question asks us to disregard pointing limits, so we consider the theoretical visibility range where a star rises above the horizon.\n    *   ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, at a latitude of approximately -25° (Southern Hemisphere). It can observe stars with a declination (DEC) less than +65° (DEC < +65°).\n    *   HIRES is at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately +20° (Northern Hemisphere). It can observe stars with a declination greater than -70° (DEC > -70°).\n    *   For a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range. Therefore, the combined declination criterion is **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each star against the combined criteria.**\n\nWe will now check each star to see if it meets both the magnitude requirement (m_V < 16.0) and the declination requirement (-70° < DEC < +65°).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** When the apparent magnitude (m_V) is not given, we must calculate it from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`. If there is interstellar dust, we must also add the absorption term `A_V`, where `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`. The final observed magnitude is `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`.\n\n---\n\n**Star1:**\n*   `DEC = -75°`\n*   **Declination Check:** -75° is **not** within the range (-70°, +65°). It is too far south to be seen by the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star1 cannot be detected by both observatories.\n\n**Star2:**\n*   `DEC = 55°`, `m_V = 16.5` mag.\n*   **Declination Check:** 55° is within the range (-70°, +65°). The star is visible from both locations.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is 16.5 mag, which is **not** brighter than 16.0 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star2 is too faint to be detected by HIRES.\n\n**Star3:**\n*   `DEC = 48°`, `m_V = 15.5` mag.\n*   **Declination Check:** 48° is within the range (-70°, +65°). The star is visible from both locations.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is 15.5 mag, which **is** brighter than 16.0 mag. (Note: \"Apparent magnitude\" is taken as the final observed value, including any extinction effects. The extra information is extraneous.)\n*   **Conclusion:** Star3 can be detected by both observatories.\n\n**Star4:**\n*   `DEC = -48°`, `M_V = 15.5` mag, `d = 10` pc, `E(B-V) = 0.4` mag.\n*   **Declination Check:** -48° is within the range (-70°, +65°). The star is visible from both locations.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the observed apparent magnitude.\n    1.  Absorption `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    2.  `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n    3.  `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    4.  `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * (1) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n    5.  The apparent magnitude is 16.74 mag, which is **not** brighter than 16.0 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star4 is too faint to be detected by HIRES.\n\n**Star5:**\n*   `DEC = 60°`, `M_V = 16.5` mag, `d = 5` pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** 60° is within the range (-70°, +65°). The star is visible from both locations.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the observed apparent magnitude. (No extinction mentioned, so `A_V = 0`).\n    1.  `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    2.  `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    3.  `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n    4.  The apparent magnitude is ~15.0 mag, which **is** brighter than 16.0 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star5 can be detected by both observatories.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the stars that satisfy both the declination and magnitude criteria for joint observation are **Star3** and **Star5**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
