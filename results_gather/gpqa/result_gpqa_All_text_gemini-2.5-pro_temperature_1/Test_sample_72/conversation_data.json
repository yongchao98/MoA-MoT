    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given information and the goal**\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: `v1 = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: `v2 = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nWe need to find:\n1.  The relative speed (`v_rel`) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The total energy (`E`) of the system of two astronauts.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot use the simple classical formula for relative velocity (`v_rel = v1 - v2`). We must use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula.\n\n**Formula:** The relative velocity `v_rel` of an object with velocity `v1` as seen from a reference frame moving with velocity `v2` (when both velocities are in the same direction) is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  Substitute the given values `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into the formula.\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n2.  Simplify the numerator:\n    `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`\n3.  Simplify the term in the denominator's parenthesis:\n    `(0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2 = 0.3 * c^2 / c^2 = 0.3`\n4.  Calculate the denominator:\n    `1 - 0.3 = 0.7`\n5.  Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c`\n6.  Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the total energy (E) of the system**\n\n**Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of each astronaut. The total energy of a single moving particle is not its rest energy (`mc^2`) but `γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Formulas:**\n*   Total energy of the system: `E = E1 + E2`\n*   Total relativistic energy of a particle: `E_particle = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n*   Lorentz factor: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1` for astronaut 1 (`v1 = 0.6c`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n2.  Calculate the total energy `E1` of astronaut 1 (`m1 = 2m`):\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2` for astronaut 2 (`v2 = 0.5c`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n2.  Calculate the total energy `E2` of astronaut 2 (`m2 = 3m`):\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n1.  Sum the energies of the two astronauts:\n    `E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2`\n    `E = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer Selection**\nOur calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2 (Incorrect energy)\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2 (Incorrect velocity and energy)\nC) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2 (Incorrect velocity and energy)\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2 (Matches both our calculations)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
