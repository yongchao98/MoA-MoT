    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the unknown element be Y, its molar mass be M(Y), and the formula of A2 be YFₓ. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for M(Y) in terms of x:\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00x) = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nNow, we test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible element Y.\n*   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF₂ is the common fluoride).\n*   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br).\n*   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to some lanthanides).\n*   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bismuth, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the choice of Antimony (Sb). If Y = Sb and x = 3, then A2 = SbF₃.\nLet's calculate the exact mass fraction of fluorine in SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 121.76 + 56.994 = 178.754 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This strongly suggests that Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 2: Use the chemical properties to identify other compounds (A1, A3).**\n*   \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂)\".\n    The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. By conservation of mass, A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common higher fluoride is SbF₅. So, A1 = SbF₅.\n    *Careful point:* The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" and decomposes at 293 K (20 °C). Pure SbF₅ is a colorless liquid and is stable at 293 K. This is a contradiction. In complex chemical problems, quantitative data (like mass percentage) is often more reliable than qualitative descriptions (like color), which might be simplified or contain errors. We will proceed with the identification Y=Sb based on the strong numerical evidence.\n*   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\".\n    The reaction is Sb + F₂ → A3. Direct fluorination of antimony typically produces the highest stable fluoride, which is SbF₅. So, A3 = SbF₅.\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\".\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and a powerful fluorinating agent that is known to react with xenon (e.g., to form compounds like [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻). This is consistent with A1 = A3 = SbF₅.\n\n**Step 3: Identify substance A4.**\nThe problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Sb). A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are these compounds. The main binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The other three \"known\" compounds might be less common or polymeric forms, but A4 is most likely one of the two stable fluorides.\n\nWe need to find the range in which the molecular weight (MW) of A4 falls. Let's calculate the molecular weights of our candidates for A4:\n*   MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's compare these values with the given options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within range A.\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the ranges (it is close to range B, but not within it).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that A4 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion.**\nBased on the quantitative data, the element Y is antimony (Sb). The substance A4 must be a binary fluoride of antimony. By comparing the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides with the given ranges, A4 is identified as SbF₃, whose molecular weight is approximately 179 g/mol. This value falls in the range 160-180. The information about the reaction to form A5 is complex and appears contradictory, but it is not necessary to solve for the molecular weight of A4.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
