    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy of the System**\n*   The energy of any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\n**3. Understand the Partition Function**\n*   The canonical partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates.\n*   The formula is: Z = Σ_i exp(-β * E_i), where the sum is over all 8 states, and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nIt is inefficient to calculate the energy for all 8 states one by one. A more careful approach is to group the states by their configuration type, which will lead to the same energy value.\n\n**Case 1: All three spins are aligned.**\nThis happens in two states:\n*   State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    Energy E1 = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J.\n*   State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    Energy E2 = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** There are **2 states** that have an energy of **-3J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is 2.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are aligned, and one is anti-aligned.**\nThis happens in the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 states. Let's verify their energy.\n*   Subcase 2a: Two spins are +1, one is -1.\n    There are three such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, +1, -1):\n    Energy E = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J.\n    By symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy.\n*   Subcase 2b: Two spins are -1, one is +1.\n    There are three such states: (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), and (+1, -1, -1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (-1, -1, +1):\n    Energy E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = +J.\n    Again, by symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** There are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** that have an energy of **+J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is 6.\n\n**4. Assemble the Partition Function**\nNow, we can write the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by its degeneracy (g).\nZ = Σ_levels g * exp(-βE)\n\n*   Contribution from the E = -3J level (degeneracy g=2):\n    2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from the E = +J level (degeneracy g=6):\n    6 * exp(-β * (+J)) = 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n**Final Answer**\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - Correct\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
