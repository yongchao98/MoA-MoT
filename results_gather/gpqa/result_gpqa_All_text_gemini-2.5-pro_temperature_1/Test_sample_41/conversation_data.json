    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Given Information\n*   **System:** Three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) in circular orbits around the same star.\n*   **Temperature Ratios:**\n    *   T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   T2 / T3 ≈ 2.3\n    (where T1, T2, T3 are the equilibrium temperatures)\n*   **Mass Ratios:**\n    *   M1 / M2 ≈ 1.15\n    *   M2 / M3 ≈ 1.35\n    (where M1, M2, M3 are the planet masses)\n*   **Albedo:** The albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3).\n\n### Step 3: Identify Necessary Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a) from the star. The formula is derived from balancing the energy absorbed from the star with the energy radiated by the planet.\n    *   Energy Absorbed ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n    *   Energy Radiated ∝ T_eq⁴\n    *   Setting them equal: T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n    Since the albedo (A) is the same for all planets, the term (1 - A) is a constant. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    *   T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\n    *   This implies T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/² or a ∝ T_eq⁻²\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is simply the orbital radius.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   This implies P ∝ a³/²\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation\n\n**Part A: Relate Orbital Period (P) to Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq)**\n\nWe have two key relationships:\n1.  From Kepler's Law: P ∝ a³/²\n2.  From the temperature equation: a ∝ T_eq⁻²\n\nWe can substitute the expression for 'a' from the second relationship into the first one to find a direct link between period and temperature.\nP ∝ (T_eq⁻²)³/²\nP ∝ T_eq⁻³\n\nThis crucial result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. For any two planets (i and j) in the system, their period and temperature ratios are related as:\n(P_j / P_i) = (T_j / T_i)⁻³ = (T_i / T_j)³\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Temperature Ratio between Planet1 and Planet3 (T1 / T3)**\n\nWe are given the individual ratios and need to combine them:\n*   T1 / T2 = 1.4\n*   T2 / T3 = 2.3\n\nTo find T1 / T3, we can multiply these two equations:\n(T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3) = T1 / T3\nT1 / T3 = 1.4 * 2.3\nT1 / T3 = 3.22\n\n**Part C: Calculate the Orbital Period Ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 (P3 / P1)**\n\nUsing the relationship derived in Part A (P_j / P_i = (T_i / T_j)³), we can set i=1 and j=3:\nP3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)³\n\nNow, we substitute the value of T1 / T3 calculated in Part B:\nP3 / P1 = (3.22)³\nP3 / P1 = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22\nP3 / P1 = 10.3684 * 3.22\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nRounding to one decimal place, we get 33.4.\n\n### Step 5: List Careful Points and Final Check\n\n*   **Planet Masses:** The given mass ratios (M1/M2 and M2/M3) and the mention of the TTV method are distractors. The TTV method is used to determine planet masses, but the mass of a planet has a negligible effect on its own orbital period compared to the mass of the central star. Kepler's Third Law as used here (P² ∝ a³) assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which is a standard and valid assumption.\n*   **Albedo:** The fact that the albedo is constant for all three planets is important. It allows us to simplify the temperature-distance relationship (T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²). If the albedos were different, we would need to include the (1 - A) factor in our ratio calculations, but since they are the same, this factor cancels out.\n*   **Circular Orbits:** This simplifies the problem by allowing us to use the orbital radius 'a' directly as the semi-major axis in Kepler's Law.\n\nThe calculation steps are logically sound and the result matches one of the provided options.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
