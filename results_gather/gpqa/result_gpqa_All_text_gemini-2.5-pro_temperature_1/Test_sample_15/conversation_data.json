    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `ClHC=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The (Z) designation means the high-priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. For C1, Cl > H. For C2, -CH2CH3 > -CH3. So, Cl and the ethyl group are on the same side.\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule has a double bond, so the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n*   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the configuration of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific configuration like (R) or (S) means that the center is chiral. The compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer. A single stereoisomer of a chiral molecule (an enantiomer) is by definition optically active. The only exception would be if the molecule were meso, but the complex and unsymmetrical nature described by the name makes this possibility extremely unlikely. A specific enantiomer is always optically active.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n*   **Analysis:** This compound has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S). We need to check for internal symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond, and the two halves of the molecule are mirror images of each other. This is a classic example of a *meso* compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n*   **Analysis:** In this isomer, both stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n*   **Analysis:** The name specifies the configuration at C1 as (R). This indicates that C1 is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to C1 are -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-CH=. The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different due to the position of the double bond, so C1 is indeed a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) implies a symmetrical arrangement, which corresponds to the all-cis isomer where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n*   **Analysis:** In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups can occupy equatorial positions. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters because the two ring pathways from each are identical.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n*   **Analysis:** We must search for stereocenters.\n    *   In the `(CH3)2CH-` group, the CH carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it's not a stereocenter.\n    *   The `-CH2-` and `-C(=O)-` carbons are not stereocenters.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are either attached to the carbonyl group or are -CH2- groups. The ring is symmetrically substituted. There is no stereocenter in the ring.\n    The molecule lacks any stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C=O group and the `isobutyl` chain, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, it is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
