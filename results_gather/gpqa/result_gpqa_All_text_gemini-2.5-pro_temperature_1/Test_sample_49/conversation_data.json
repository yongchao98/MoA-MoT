    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Expression**\n\nThe expression given is: `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\nTo determine the number of loops, we need to understand what each part of this expression represents in the context of a Feynman diagram calculation in quantum field theory.\n\n*   `alpha` and `g`: These are coupling constants. The power of the coupling constants in an expression relates to the number of vertices in the diagram. Each vertex contributes one factor of a coupling constant. Here, `alpha^3 * g^2` suggests the diagram has 5 vertices in total (3 of one type associated with `alpha`, and 2 of another type associated with `g`).\n*   `sqrt(2)` and `8`: These are dimensionless numerical factors. They can come from various sources, such as symmetry factors of the diagram, group theory factors from the gauge group (e.g., traces), or results of spinor algebra (e.g., traces over gamma matrices). They do not have a universal scaling with the loop number.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This term represents a ratio of two energy scales (or masses) squared. Such terms typically arise from the evaluation of the loop integrals and often appear alongside logarithms, e.g., `log(Q^2/M^2)`. The exact power depends on the specifics of the integral. While it's a result of the loop calculation, it doesn't directly tell us the number of loops.\n*   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the most important term for solving the problem. Factors of `4π` are a hallmark of loop integrals in quantum field theory.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the `4π` Factor to the Number of Loops**\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, let's say `k`. The standard measure for this integral is `d^4k / (2pi)^4`.\n\nWhen these integrals are evaluated (typically using techniques like dimensional regularization and Feynman parametrization), each loop integral consistently produces a characteristic geometric factor. For calculations in `d=4` dimensions, this factor is `1/(16π^2)`.\n\nWe can rewrite this factor as:\n`1 / (16π^2) = 1 / (4^2 * π^2) = 1 / (4π)^2`\n\nSo, a one-loop diagram (L=1) will have a factor of `1/(4π)^2`.\nA two-loop diagram (L=2) will have two such integrals, leading to a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^2 = 1/(4π)^4`.\nIn general, a diagram with `L` loops will have a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the Number of Loops (L)**\n\nThe expression from your colleague's note contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`. We can equate this to the general formula derived in Step 2:\n\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents of the `(4π)` term, we get the equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 6 / 2 = 3`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The most reliable way to determine the loop order from a final expression is to look at the power of `1/(4π)`. This scaling is a very general feature of perturbative quantum field theory in 4 dimensions.\n*   The coupling constants (`alpha`, `g`) tell you about the number of vertices, not directly the number of loops. However, the number of loops (`L`), vertices (`V`), and internal propagators (`I`) are related by the topological formula `L = I - V + 1`. Our finding of `L=3` and `V=5` is consistent and implies the diagram had `I = L + V - 1 = 3 + 5 - 1 = 7` internal lines.\n*   The other numerical and energy-ratio factors are details of the specific diagram and theory, but the `(4π)` factor is a robust indicator of the loop order.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows that the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops to produce the factor of `1/(4pi)^6` in the final expression for its amplitude.\n\n<<<B>>>"
