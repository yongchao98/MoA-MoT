    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Star Temperature (T_star): 6000 K\n    *   Spot Temperature (T_spot): T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   One hemisphere of the star is covered in spots.\n    *   Spot Filling Factor (f) on the spotted hemisphere: 20% or 0.20. This means 20% of the area of that hemisphere is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% has the normal star temperature.\n    *   The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (relative to the star's radius, R_pl/R_star) that would produce the same amplitude of brightness variation during a transit.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux Variation Caused by Starspots:**\n    *   The brightness variation is caused by the star's rotation, which alternately shows us the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere.\n    *   The flux (F) emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature raised to the fourth power:\n        *   F_max ∝ T_star⁴\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the darker, spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The flux from this hemisphere is a composite of the flux from the hot parts and the cool spots.\n        *   Area of the hot part = (1 - f) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n        *   Area of the cool spots = f = 0.2\n        *   The total flux is the weighted average: F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness, normalized by the maximum brightness.\n        *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   Substitute the expressions from Step 2. The proportionality constants will cancel out.\n        *   Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴\n    *   Simplify the numerator:\n        *   Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴\n        *   Amplitude = (f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴\n        *   Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴)) = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)\n    *   Plug in the numerical values:\n        *   f = 0.2\n        *   T_star = 6000 K\n        *   T_spot = 5000 K\n        *   Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n        *   Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n        *   Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - 625/1296)\n        *   Amplitude = 0.2 * ((1296 - 625) / 1296)\n        *   Amplitude = 0.2 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\n4.  **Relate the Spot Signal to an Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   The question asks what size exoplanet would produce the *same amplitude signal*. The signal from a transiting exoplanet is the dip in brightness, known as the transit depth.\n    *   The transit depth is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n        *   Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n    *   The reference brightness for the transit is the star's normal brightness, which corresponds to our F_max.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Exoplanet's Relative Radius (R_pl / R_star):**\n    *   Set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot-induced variation.\n        *   (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n        *   (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n    *   Take the square root to find the radius ratio:\n        *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n        *   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the star's radius, is approximately 0.32. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Model Simplification:** The calculation assumes an ideal viewing geometry (equator-on) where we see one full hemisphere at a time.\n*   **Filling Factor:** The 20% filling factor applies only to the spotted hemisphere, not the entire star.\n*   **Baseline Flux:** The \"amplitude\" is calculated relative to the maximum flux (F_max), which is also the baseline flux for a hypothetical transit on an unspotted star.\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The fourth-power dependence on temperature is the critical physical principle driving the result. A small temperature difference creates a significant flux difference.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the calculated radius ratio R_pl/R_star is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
