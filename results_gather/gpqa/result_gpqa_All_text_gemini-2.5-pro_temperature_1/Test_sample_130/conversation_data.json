    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent alkene protons, deshielded by neighboring electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This set of data uniquely identifies the starting material as *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid) and the resulting anhydride as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's determine its structure. 1,3-cyclopentadiene has double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4. Methyl groups are placed at all four of these positions. The remaining C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n               C(5)H₂\n              /   \\\n        (Me)C(4)---C(1)(Me)\n             ||      ||\n        (Me)C(3)---C(2)(Me)\n        ```\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula. The diene has 9 carbon atoms (5 in the ring, 4 in methyl groups) and 14 hydrogen atoms (2 on C5, 12 in the four methyl groups). The formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Product Structure**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) adds across the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the major product due to kinetic control (secondary orbital overlap), while the *exo* is the minor product.\n\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (\"syn\") as the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (\"anti\") to the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Spatial Proximity for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* geometry but far apart in the *exo* geometry.\n\n*   Let's analyze the structures:\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_anhydride) are tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system. In this position, they are spatially close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The H_anhydride protons are pointing \"away\" from the bicyclic system. In this position, they are far from the Me_vinyl groups. They are, however, closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead).\n\n*   Therefore, the key differentiating NOESY cross-peak is between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**. This interaction will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent in the minor (exo) product.\n\n**Step 4: Predict ¹H NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry. This leads to signal equivalence:\n    *   The two H_anhydride protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3.5 ppm) as they are alpha to carbonyls.\n    *   The two Me_vinyl groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. The chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is typically around ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The two Me_bridgehead groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. They will be more shielded, with a shift around ~1.0 ppm.\n    *   The two protons on the C7 bridge are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n\n*   We are looking for the NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and Me_vinyl (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n*   Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups (Me_bridgehead and Me_vinyl). They are not uniquely close in the endo product.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: The signal description (1H doublet) does not match our analysis of the highly symmetric product.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our predicted interaction between Me_vinyl (6H, ~1.7 ppm) and H_anhydride (2H, ~3.5 ppm).\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: The signal description (1H doublet) is inconsistent with the product's symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl) and the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). This corresponds to an interaction between a 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm), as described in option C. The \"1H doublet\" in options B and D appears to be inconsistent with the symmetry of the molecule and is likely a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
