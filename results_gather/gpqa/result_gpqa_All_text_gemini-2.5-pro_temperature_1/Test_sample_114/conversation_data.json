    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\nWe need to determine the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system before they collide. Let the horizontal axis be the x-axis, with the electron moving in the +x direction.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Moves from left to right (+x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, γₑ = 4.\n    *   Rest mass is mₑ. The rest energy is mₑc².\n    *   Total energy is Eₑ = γₑ * mₑc² = 4mₑc².\n    *   The momentum can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   pₑc = √(Eₑ² - (mₑc²)²) = √((4mₑc²)² - (mₑc²)²) = √(16mₑ²c⁴ - mₑ²c⁴) = √(15mₑ²c⁴) = √15 mₑc².\n    *   So, the electron's momentum is pₑ = √15 mₑc. Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum vector is **p**ₑ = (+√15 mₑc, 0).\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Moves from right to left (-x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor, γₚ = 2.\n    *   Rest mass is also mₑ.\n    *   Total energy is Eₚ = γₚ * mₑc² = 2mₑc².\n    *   Similarly, its momentum magnitude is pₚc = √(Eₚ² - (mₑc²)²) = √((2mₑc²)² - (mₑc²)²) = √(4mₑ²c⁴ - mₑ²c⁴) = √(3mₑ²c⁴) = √3 mₑc².\n    *   So, the positron's momentum is pₚ = √3 mₑc. Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum vector is **p**ₚ = (-√3 mₑc, 0).\n\n**2. Calculate Total Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   E_initial = Eₑ + Eₚ = 4mₑc² + 2mₑc² = 6mₑc².\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   **p**_initial = **p**ₑ + **p**ₚ = (+√15 mₑc, 0) + (-√3 mₑc, 0) = ((√15 - √3)mₑc, 0).\n\n**3. Define the Final State (After Collision)**\n\nThe electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons (let's call them γ₁ and γ₂).\n\n*   The photons have equal energy: E_γ₁ = E_γ₂ = E_γ.\n*   For a photon, the momentum is related to its energy by p = E/c. Thus, the photons also have equal momentum magnitudes: p_γ₁ = p_γ₂ = p_γ = E_γ/c.\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum in the y-direction must also be zero. This means the y-components of the photons' momenta must be equal and opposite.\n*   Given that the photons have the same momentum magnitude, this symmetry implies that if one photon travels at an angle θ with respect to the x-axis, the other must travel at an angle -θ.\n*   Photon 1 (upper-right): **p**_γ₁ = (p_γ cos(θ), p_γ sin(θ)).\n*   Photon 2 (lower-right): **p**_γ₂ = (p_γ cos(θ), -p_γ sin(θ)).\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mₑc² = E_γ₁ + E_γ₂ = 2E_γ\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon: E_γ = 3mₑc².\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   **p**_initial = **p**_final\n    *   ((√15 - √3)mₑc, 0) = **p**_γ₁ + **p**_γ₂\n    *   ((√15 - √3)mₑc, 0) = (p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ), p_γ sin(θ) - p_γ sin(θ))\n    *   ((√15 - √3)mₑc, 0) = (2p_γ cos(θ), 0).\n    *   From the x-component of this equation: (√15 - √3)mₑc = 2p_γ cos(θ).\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can now solve for the angle θ.\n\n*   First, find the momentum of each photon using its energy: p_γ = E_γ/c = (3mₑc²)/c = 3mₑc.\n*   Substitute this into the momentum conservation equation:\n    *   (√15 - √3)mₑc = 2 * (3mₑc) * cos(θ)\n*   The term `mₑc` cancels from both sides:\n    *   √15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)\n*   Solve for cos(θ):\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   Find the angle θ:\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\n**6. Determine the Angle Between the Photons**\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. One photon travels at an angle +θ to the x-axis, and the other at -θ. The total angle between their directions is:\n*   Total Angle = θ - (-θ) = 2θ\n*   Total Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Momentum is a vector:** The positron's momentum must be treated as negative since it moves in the opposite direction to the electron.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use the correct relativistic formulas for energy (E=γmc²) and momentum (p=√(E²-(mc²)²)/c).\n*   **Photon Properties:** For photons (massless particles), the energy-momentum relation is simply E = pc.\n*   **Symmetry:** The fact that the final photons have equal energy simplifies the problem, leading to symmetric angles (θ and -θ) relative to the axis of initial net momentum.\n*   **Final Question:** The question asks for the angle between the two photons (2θ), not the angle of one photon relative to the axis (θ).\n\nFinal calculation confirms that the angle between the two photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>"
