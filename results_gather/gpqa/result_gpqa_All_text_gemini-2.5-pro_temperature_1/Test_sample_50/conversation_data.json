    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Setup**\n\n*   We have a point charge `q`.\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n*   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the grounded sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`. The image charge is placed at a specific location inside the sphere, chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n\n**3. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe system outside the sphere is now electrostatically equivalent to two point charges: the original charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin, and the image charge `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n**4. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\nThe force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (where `x > R`) from the center is due to the attraction of the induced charges on the sphere. This force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\n*   Force on `q` at position `x`: `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n*   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -q(R/x)` at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n*   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   `F(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / [x - R^2/x]^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    (The negative sign indicates an attractive force).\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against this electric force to bring the charge from infinity to `d`.\n`U = W_ext = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [-F(x)] dx`\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use u-substitution: Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫ 1/u^2 * (du/2) = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫ u^(-2) du`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] = -(k * q^2 * R) / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate this from the starting point (`x=∞`) to the end point (`x=d`):\n`U = [-(k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-(k * q^2 * R) / (2(∞^2 - R^2))]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) - 0`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of grounded conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n*   This `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n*   `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d] = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Careful Points & Summary:**\n*   **The 1/2 Factor:** The potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the charge and its image. This factor is crucial and arises because the induced charge itself is created by the presence of `q`; the system's energy is not a simple sum but an integral over the assembly process.\n*   **The sign is negative:** The force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is always attractive. Therefore, the potential energy of the system is negative (relative to zero energy at infinite separation), as the field does positive work to bring the charge in.\n*   **Final Formula:** `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Match with Options**\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R²)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          (Incorrect, missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)    (Correct)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)     (Incorrect, has d instead of R, wrong denominator)\n\nThe final answer matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
