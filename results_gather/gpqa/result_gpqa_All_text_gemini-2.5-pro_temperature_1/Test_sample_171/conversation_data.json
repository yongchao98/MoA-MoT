    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct equation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Physics\nThe problem deals with the relative populations of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of two stars. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the distribution of atoms among their different energy states.\n\n### Step 2: Write Down the Boltzmann Equation\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy states, a higher energy state `j` and a lower energy state `i`:\n\n(N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in states `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n*   `E_j`, `E_i` are the energies of the states. The difference is ΔE = E_j - E_i.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star\nWe are comparing the same two energy levels of iron atoms in both stars. This means that the statistical weights (`g_j`, `g_i`) and the energy difference (ΔE) are the same for both cases. Let's denote the constant term `(g_j / g_i)` as `C`.\n\n*   **For star_1 (temperature T_1):**\n    The ratio of populations is (N_j / N_i)_1.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n*   **For star_2 (temperature T_2):**\n    The ratio of populations is (N_j / N_i)_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n### Step 4: Use the Information Given in the Problem\nThe problem states two key pieces of information:\n\n1.  \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2.\"\n    This translates mathematically to:\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n2.  \"the energy difference... was... approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\"\n    This means ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n\n    **Careful Point:** Notice that the value of the Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. The problem is designed such that we can make the simplification ΔE ≈ k, which means the ratio **ΔE / k ≈ 1 K**. This is a crucial step.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Equations and Simplify\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions from Step 3 into the relationship from Step 4:\n\nC * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * ( C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )\n\n1.  Cancel the constant `C` from both sides:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n2.  Isolate the constant '2' by dividing the exponential terms:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\n3.  Use the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n    exp[ ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) ] = 2\n\n4.  Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\n5.  Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n6.  Substitute the key simplification found in Step 4, where `ΔE / k ≈ 1`:\n    1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n7.  Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n    (T_1 / (T_1 * T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1 * T_2)) = ln(2)\n    (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) = ln(2)\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\nThe derived equation is:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option A exactly.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]  <- **Correct**\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\nC) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\n<<<A>>>"
