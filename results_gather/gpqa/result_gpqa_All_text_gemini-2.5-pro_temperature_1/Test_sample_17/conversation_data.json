    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Notation and Goal**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_Sun )`\nHere, `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of atoms of element X and Y. The unit \"dex\" stands for \"decimal exponent\" and simply confirms we are using base-10 logarithms.\n\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In astrophysics, this is standardly interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, i.e., `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n\n**2. Analyze Star_1**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n\nWe want to find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_1, which is represented by `[Si/H]_1`. We can use the following identity, which can be derived from the definition of the bracket notation:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\nApplying this to our elements (A=Si, B=Fe, C=H):\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nNow, we expand the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n`0.3 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n\nTaking the antilog (10 to the power of both sides):\n`(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun`\n\n**3. Analyze Star_2**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n\nSimilarly, we want to find `[Si/H]_2`. We use a different form of the identity:\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\nApplying this to our elements (A=Mg, B=Si):\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nNow, we expand the definition of `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n`-0.3 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n\nTaking the antilog:\n`(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun`\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nThe desired ratio is the silicon abundance in Star_1 divided by the silicon abundance in Star_2:\nRatio = `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\nSubstitute the expressions we found in steps 2 and 3:\nRatio = `( 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n\nThe term for the Sun's silicon abundance, `(n_Si / n_H)_Sun`, cancels out:\nRatio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents (x^a / x^b = x^(a-b)):\nRatio = `10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\nRatio = `10^(0.3 + 0.3)`\nRatio = `10^0.6`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n`10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 solar masses) are extra information not needed for this calculation.\n*   The absolute solar abundances for Fe and Mg (7.5 and 7.0) are also not directly needed, as all calculations are relative to the Sun and key ratios like `[Fe/H]` and `[Mg/H]` are given.\n*   The core of the problem is the correct manipulation of the `[X/Y]` abundance notation.\n*   The final calculation `10^0.6` needs to be evaluated. An estimate (`10^0.5` is about 3.16, so `10^0.6` is somewhat larger) can help you quickly check if your answer is in the right ballpark.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of silicon atoms (abundances) in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
