    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to that of Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the energy it receives from the star and its own properties. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo (the fraction of power reflected).\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nWe need to calculate the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Let's write out the full expression for the ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must identify which terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out.\n*   The star is the same for both planets, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`.\n*   The factor of `2` is a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the formula simplifies significantly:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the orbital distances, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) caused by each planet. This information can be used to find the semi-major axis `a`.\n\n**5. From Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\nThe maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max` is related to the star's maximum radial velocity `K` (the amplitude of the RV curve) by the non-relativistic Doppler formula:\n`K / c = Δλ_max / λ_0`  =>  `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nLet's find the ratio of the RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2`:\n`K_1 / K_2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)]`\nThe terms `c` and `λ_0` cancel out.\n`K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n**6. From Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Distance (a)**\nThe RV amplitude `K` induced by a planet of mass `m_p` on a star of mass `M_star` in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (m_p / M_star) * v_orb * sin(i)`\nwhere `v_orb` is the planet's orbital velocity and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method. This implies that the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume this for both planets.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity is given by Kepler's laws:\n`v_orb = sqrt(G * (M_star + m_p) / a)`\nSince the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`m_p << M_star`), we can approximate this as:\n`v_orb ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for `K`:\n`K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`\n\n**7. Derive the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a_2 / a_1)**\nFrom the relationship `K ∝ m_p / sqrt(a)`, we can solve for `sqrt(a)`:\n`sqrt(a) ∝ m_p / K`\nSquaring both sides gives the relationship for `a`:\n`a ∝ (m_p / K)^2`\n\nNow we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (m_p2 / K_2)^2 / (m_p1 / K_1)^2 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**8. Calculate the Numerical Value of the Ratios**\nWe have the following information from the problem:\n*   `m_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n*   `m_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n*   The ratio of RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2 = 3/4` (from step 5).\n\nNow, let's calculate the required ratios:\n*   `m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nNow we return to the simplified temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nSubstitute the value we just found for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** These numbers are perfect squares. `sqrt(225) = 15` and `sqrt(784) = 28`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nFinally, compute the decimal value:\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n**10. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value `~0.536` is closest to option D. The extra information given in the problem (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) was not needed for the final ratio calculation, which is common in such physics problems.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n<<<D>>>"
