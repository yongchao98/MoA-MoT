    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units ($\\hbar=c=1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n*   The dimension of the action is $[S] = M^0$ (where M stands for mass).\n*   The dimension of the four-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = [Length]^4 = [M^{-1}]^4 = M^{-4}$.\n*   Since $[S] = [\\mathcal{L}][d^4x]$, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must be:\n    $[\\mathcal{L}] = \\frac{[S]}{[d^4x]} = \\frac{M^0}{M^{-4}} = M^4$.\nEvery term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Tensors**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. Let's consider the derivative part, $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be $M^4$: $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\gamma^\\mu][\\partial_\\mu][\\psi] = M^4$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless, so $[\\gamma^\\mu]=M^0$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has the dimension of momentum, which is mass: $[\\partial_\\mu]=M^1$.\n    *   The fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ have the same mass dimension: $[\\psi]=[\\bar{\\psi}]$.\n    *   So, we have $[\\psi]^2 \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$, which gives $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$, and thus $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also a dimensionless matrix.\n    *   The factor $i/2$ is also dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, the tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be $M^4$: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$, and thus $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ from the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. The dimension of this term must be $M^4$.\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$.\n\nSolving for $[\\kappa]$:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$.\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The rule of thumb (by power-counting) is as follows:\n*   If the coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension (e.g., $M^d$ with $d>0$), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If the coupling constant is **dimensionless** (mass dimension 0, $d=0$), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If the coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension (e.g., $M^d$ with $d<0$), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa] = M^{-1}$. Since the dimension is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nA non-renormalizable theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to cancel divergences at all orders of perturbation theory, which makes the theory lose its predictive power at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of the coupling constant is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
