    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of density in planets.**\nDensity is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. The key point to understand for planets is the effect of **gravitational compression**. As a planet's mass increases, its own gravity becomes stronger, squeezing the material it's made of. This means that for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have its material compressed more, leading to a higher overall density.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is our reference point. It is essentially Earth itself.\n    *   Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n    *   The density is given directly in the question.\n    *   The density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to, but slightly less than, Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   **Mass:** M = 5 * M_Earth.\n    *   **Composition:** Same as Earth (mostly iron and silicates).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because this planet is much more massive than Earth, its internal gravity will be much stronger. This intense gravity will compress the iron and silicates more tightly than they are compressed inside Earth.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Greater mass with the same composition leads to greater gravitational compression, which results in a higher density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   **Mass:** M = 0.5 * M_Earth.\n    *   **Composition:** Same as Earth.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Following the same logic as in (c), this planet has less mass than Earth. Its internal gravity will be weaker, and it will not be able to compress its materials as much as Earth does.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Less mass with the same composition leads to less gravitational compression, which results in a lower density. Therefore, this planet's density will be lower than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the densities.**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high mass and compression)\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low mass and less compression)\n\nBy comparing the values, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
