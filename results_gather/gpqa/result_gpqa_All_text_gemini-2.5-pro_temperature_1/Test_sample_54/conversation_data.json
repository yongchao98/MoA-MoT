    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n    *   **Data:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n    *   **Interpretation:** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (`3H`). Its multiplicity is a singlet (`s`), meaning these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds (Cis/Trans-propenyl acetate and Cis/Trans-butenyl acetate) contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\n    *   These signals are in the vinylic region (5-8 ppm), indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). There are two such protons, each integrating to `1H`.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm:** `(1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n        *   This is a vinylic proton that is split into a doublet (`d`), meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   The coupling constant (`J`) is **16.0 Hz**. This value is very important. For protons on a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** relationship. A smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a **trans** double bond.\n        *   This immediately allows us to favor the *trans* isomers and disfavor the *cis* isomers.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm:** `(1H, dq)`\n        *   This is the second vinylic proton. Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n        *   The doublet (`d`) part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm).\n        *   The quartet (`q`) part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to the same carbon as this proton.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Signal at 1.6 ppm:**\n    *   **Data:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n    *   **Interpretation:** This signal is for 3 protons (`3H`), confirming it's a methyl group. It is a doublet (`d`), meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton. This is consistent with the `dq` splitting of the proton at 5.5 ppm. This methyl group is the one adjacent to the proton at 5.5 ppm. A methyl group attached to a double bond (a vinylic methyl) typically appears in this chemical shift range.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we have identified two key fragments: an acetate group (`CH₃COO-`) and a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=CH-`).\n    *   Putting them together gives the structure for propenyl acetate: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   This structure has the correct number of signals and protons: one acetyl methyl (singlet), one vinylic methyl (doublet), and two vinylic protons (one doublet, one dq).\n    *   This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (A and B). A butenyl acetate (`CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-O-Ac`) would have signals for an ethyl group (a -CH₂- and a -CH₃), which are not present in the spectrum.\n    *   Now we must choose between Cis-propenyl acetate (C) and Trans-propenyl acetate (D). As determined in step 2, the large coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** between the vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a **trans** configuration.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 4 signals, which matches the 4 unique proton environments in propenyl acetate, but not the 5 environments in butenyl acetate.\n*   **Integration:** The proton count (3H, 3H, 1H, 1H) matches the 8 protons of propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂).\n*   **Splitting Patterns:** The multiplicities (`s`, `d`, `dq`) perfectly describe the connectivity within the `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃` structure.\n*   **Coupling Constant (J):** The value `J = 16.0 Hz` is the key piece of information to distinguish between cis and trans isomers. This value falls squarely in the range for trans coupling.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the double bond has a trans configuration. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
