    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet, the light we receive from it is alternately blueshifted (moving towards us) and redshifted (moving away). The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. The problem gives the *amplitude* of this periodic shift, which corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, often denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate the Observed Shifts to Stellar Velocities:**\n    *   For Planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For Planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the System's Physical Properties:**\n    *   In a two-body system, the star and planet orbit a common center of mass. By conservation of momentum: M_star * v_star = m_planet * v_planet.\n    *   The amplitude of the star's velocity is K = v_star (assuming we are viewing the orbit edge-on for maximum effect, a standard simplifying assumption when inclination is not given).\n    *   So, K = (m_planet / M_star) * v_planet.\n    *   For a circular orbit, the planet's velocity v_planet is related to the gravitational force: G * M_star * m_planet / a² = m_planet * v_planet² / a, where 'a' is the orbital radius.\n    *   This simplifies to v_planet = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for K: K = (m_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_planet * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a)).\n    *   This shows that for given masses, K is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n    *   K ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a). For a planet much less massive than its star (m_planet << M_star), the law is: T² ∝ a³.\n    *   From this, we can find the relationship between 'a' and 'T': a ∝ T^(2/3).\n\n5.  **Establish the Final Relationship between Stellar Velocity (K) and Period (T):**\n    *   We have two proportionalities: K ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and a ∝ T^(2/3).\n    *   We can substitute the second into the first: K ∝ 1 / sqrt(T^(2/3)).\n    *   Simplifying the exponent: K ∝ 1 / T^((2/3) * (1/2)) = 1 / T^(1/3).\n    *   So, the stellar velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (K ∝ T^(-1/3)).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    *   We can write the relationship from the previous step as a ratio for our two systems: K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3).\n    *   This is the same as: K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3).\n    *   We already calculated K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n    *   So, 1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3).\n    *   To find the ratio T₁ / T₂, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744.\n    *   The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio T₂ / T₁.\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = 1 / (T₁ / T₂) = 1 / 2.744.\n    *   T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644.\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The given wavelength shifts (5 mÅ and 7 mÅ) are the *amplitudes* of the periodic shift, which directly relate to the *amplitudes* of the star's radial velocity (K).\n*   The problem simplifies the situation by stating the stars have identical masses, the planets have similar masses, and the orbits are circular. This allows us to cancel out these terms when forming a ratio.\n*   We must assume the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems to directly compare the velocity amplitudes.\n*   The final derivation shows that a larger stellar wobble (larger K or Δλ) implies a *shorter* orbital period. This makes sense: for a planet of the same mass, being closer to the star (shorter period) means it has a higher orbital velocity and exerts a stronger, faster tug on the star, causing a larger stellar velocity.\n*   Be careful not to mix up the ratios. The question asks for T₂ / T₁, so after finding T₁ / T₂ = 2.744, we must take the reciprocal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
