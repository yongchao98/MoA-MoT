    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup and identify the key components.**\n*   We have a spherical conductor that is initially uncharged. Let's call its center O and its radius R.\n*   Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. Let's call its center C and its radius r. The distance between O and C is $s$.\n*   A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the conductor's center O to P is $L$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors.**\n*   **Charge Induction:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To completely cancel the electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the bulk of the conductor material, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n*   **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. Since charges in a conductor can only reside on its surfaces, this $+q$ charge will spread out over the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the charge distribution on the outer surface.**\n*   We now have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   The outer surface is a perfect sphere of radius $R$.\n*   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the charge on its surface will arrange itself to make the conductor an equipotential volume. In the absence of any external electric fields, the most symmetric distribution is the most stable. Therefore, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself *uniformly* over the spherical outer surface.\n*   **Careful Point:** The position of the cavity and the charge inside it are irregular and non-symmetric with respect to the center O. However, this does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface. The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. The field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero, effectively isolating the \"inside world\" (the cavity) from the \"outside world\". The only thing the outside world \"knows\" is that a total charge of $+q$ has appeared on the outer surface.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the electric field at point P.**\n*   The electric field at the external point P is the result of all charges in the system. By the principle of superposition, this is the sum of the fields from:\n    1.  The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    2.  The induced charge $-q$ on the inner cavity surface.\n    3.  The induced charge $+q$ on the outer conductor surface.\n*   **Key Concept (Shell Theorem / Gauss's Law):** The electric field produced by the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the cavity wall) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. The conductor shields the external point P from these internal charges.\n*   Therefore, the only source that contributes to the electric field at point P is the charge $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is $+q$. The center of this shell is O. The distance from O to P is $L$.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final expression for the electric field.**\n*   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(Distance from center)}^2}$\n*   Substituting the values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options.**\n*   The derived expression $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ matches option C.\n*   **Careful Point:** The information about the cavity's radius $r$, its offset $s$, the distance $l$ from the cavity's center, and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors. They describe the internal geometry, which is shielded from the external point P by the conductor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
