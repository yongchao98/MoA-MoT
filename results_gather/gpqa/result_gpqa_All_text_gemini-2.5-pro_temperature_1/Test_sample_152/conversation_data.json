    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n**1. Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile) and Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):**\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). The α-hydrogens are acidic (pKa ≈ 13) because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with two ester groups.\n*   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates dimethyl malonate to form a nucleophilic enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group).\n\n**2. The Michael Addition Reaction:**\n*   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n*   `p-tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃` + `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of the malonate. The π electrons shift, creating a new enolate intermediate.\n*   Intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`\n*   **Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product (A):** The final product structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n**3. Name the Product (A):**\n*   The product has a three-carbon main chain with three methyl carboxylate groups.\n*   Let's name it as a substituted propane. The longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional groups is a propane skeleton with carboxylate groups at positions 1 and 3.\n*   The structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n*   Numbering the propane chain C1-C2-C3 gives `(CH₃OOC)₂C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOCH₃)`.\n*   The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n**1. Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but highly nucleophilic at the β-carbon due to resonance involving the nitrogen lone pair.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon (the one attached to the methyl group).\n\n**2. The Michael Addition Reaction (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n*   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n*   This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate. The resulting carbanion on the nitrile fragment is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n*   Intermediate (after protonation): An iminium salt where the cyclohexanone ring is substituted at the α-position (C2) with a `CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group.\n\n**3. Hydrolysis Workup:**\n*   The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine is removed as a piperidinium salt.\n*   **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is the `CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group.\n\n**4. Name the Product (B):**\n*   The main functional group is the nitrile. The parent chain is butanenitrile.\n*   Numbering the chain: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H₃`. The side chain is attached at C3.\n*   The substituent is a 2-oxocyclohexyl group.\n*   Therefore, the name of product (B) is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product, not the enol form.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction (C): C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n*   This is a Michael addition where we are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Base:** KOH.\n\n**2. Identify the Bond Formed:**\n*   In a Michael addition, the new C-C bond is formed between the nucleophilic α-carbon of the donor and the electrophilic β-carbon of the acceptor.\n*   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring connected to a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`) at position C2.\n*   The acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`), upon Michael addition, becomes the `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`). The new bond is to the terminal `CH₂` (the former β-carbon).\n*   This means the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n**3. Identify Reactant C:**\n*   The active methylene hydrogens at C2 of a 1,3-dione are very acidic (pKa ≈ 5) because the resulting enolate is doubly stabilized by two carbonyl groups. The base KOH easily deprotonates it.\n*   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
