    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reaction sequence involves two steps: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, and 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with aqueous acid (H3O+). This overall sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Addition:** The key is to correctly determine the stereochemistry of the products resulting from an *anti*-addition to both a *cis* ((Z)) and a *trans* ((E)) alkene.\n*   **Symmetry of Molecules:** Both the starting alkenes (oct-4-ene) and the final products (octane-4,5-diol) are symmetrically substituted (a propyl group on each side of the central functional group). This symmetry is crucial for determining whether meso compounds are possible.\n*   **Product Identification:** We need to identify all unique stereoisomers formed in the two reactions.\n*   **Chromatography Principles:** It's essential to understand the difference between standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC.\n    *   **Standard HPLC** separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC** uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate enantiomers, as well as diastereomers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for a symmetrically substituted alkene is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the meso stereoisomer of octane-4,5-diol. This compound is achiral and has the configuration (4R, 5S), which is identical to (4S, 5R). Let's call this compound **Meso-Diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for a symmetrically substituted alkene is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  **Meso-Diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(R,R)-Diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(S,S)-Diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n    *   **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Meso-Diol** is a **diastereomer** of both **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   The **Meso-Diol** is a diastereomer of the other two compounds, so it will have a unique retention time and produce one peak.\n*   The enantiomers, **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**, are inseparable on an achiral column and will co-elute, producing a second single peak.\n*   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on the Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   The three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The **Meso-Diol** will produce one peak.\n*   The **(R,R)-Diol** will produce a second, separate peak.\n*   The **(S,S)-Diol** will produce a third, separate peak.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
