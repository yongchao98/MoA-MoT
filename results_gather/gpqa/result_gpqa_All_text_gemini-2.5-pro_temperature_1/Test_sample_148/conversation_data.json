    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the observations from the experimental data.**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** A chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. Peptides are polymers of amino acids linked by amide bonds. A key feature of amide bonds (R-CO-NH-R') is the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond, which restricts free rotation.\n*   **¹H NMR Observation 1:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n*   **¹H NMR Observation 2:** These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals are roughly equal, summing up to the expected total of 1 proton. This indicates the two species giving rise to these peaks are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n*   **¹H NMR Observation 3:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This means the splitting is not due to interaction with an adjacent proton. The two peaks represent two chemically distinct environments for the same type of proton.\n*   **LC-MS Observation 1:** Two separate peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, even at elevated temperature. This means there are two distinct compounds or conformers that have different affinities for the chromatography column and can be physically separated. The separation at elevated temperature implies a significant energy barrier to their interconversion.\n*   **LC-MS Observation 2:** The two LC peaks have equal intensities, which corroborates the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n*   **LC-MS Observation 3:** Both peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected target molecule. This is a critical point: it confirms that both species have the same chemical formula and are isomers of each other, not impurities like precursors or byproducts with a different mass.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the proposed explanations (the options) against the observations.**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This would mean an extra amino acid was accidentally added to the peptide chain.\n    *   The resulting molecule would have a significantly higher mass than the expected product.\n    *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows the mass is correct for the expected molecule. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Crucially, diastereomers have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This is consistent with seeing two peaks in both NMR and LC.\n    *   A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is the restricted rotation around an amide bond, leading to *cis* and *trans* conformers (these are also called rotamers or atropisomers). These conformers are diastereomeric with respect to each other.\n    *   The alpha-proton of an amino acid residue is in a different chemical environment in the *cis* form versus the *trans* form, leading to two distinct NMR signals.\n    *   These two conformers can have slightly different polarities, allowing them to be separated by LC. Since they are just different spatial arrangements of the same molecule, they have the identical mass.\n    *   This explanation fits *all* the observations perfectly. The two species are the *cis* and *trans* isomers of the peptide, which are a type of diastereomer.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard, achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical properties, including identical NMR spectra and identical retention times on a standard LC column.\n    *   To see two different signals for enantiomers, you would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral NMR solvent or a chiral chromatography column), which is not mentioned.\n    *   Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would produce only a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC. This contradicts the observations. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis.\n    *   It would have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight than the final product.\n    *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both separated peaks have the same, correct mass for the final product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the most likely explanation.**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the existence of two isomeric forms of the peptide in a 1:1 ratio. These isomers have the same mass, can be separated chromatographically, and are distinguishable by NMR. This is the classic signature of *cis/trans* isomerism around an amide bond, a phenomenon frequently observed in peptides (especially those containing proline). Since *cis* and *trans* isomers are non-superimposable, non-mirror image isomers, they are, by definition, diastereoisomers. Therefore, option B provides the best and most accurate description of the situation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
