    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the genetic experiment to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the data for each single mutant**\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means that a functional G1 gene contributes to 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75% = 25%).\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means that a functional G2 gene is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss eliminates 100% of the resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means that a functional G3 gene contributes to 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50% = 50%).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the epistasis data from the double mutants**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of one of the single mutants. The gene whose phenotype is expressed is called epistatic, and it typically acts upstream in a genetic pathway.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the **g2** single mutant (0% resistance), not the g1 single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the **g2 mutation is epistatic to the g1 mutation**. This places G2 upstream of G1 in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the **g2** single mutant (0% resistance), not the g3 single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the **g2 mutation is epistatic to the g3 mutation**. This places G2 upstream of G3 in the resistance pathway.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the role of G2**\n\n*   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must act upstream of both genes.\n*   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.\n*   Given that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3 and is essential for any resistance, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of both G1 and G3**.\n    *   *Pathway Model so far:* G2 -> (activates) G1 and G3.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3**\n\nNow we look at the double mutant that doesn't involve the master regulator G2.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n*   Let's predict the outcome if the genes acted independently and additively. The loss of G1 causes a 25% drop, and the loss of G3 causes a 50% drop. An additive effect would result in a 75% total drop (25% + 50%), leaving 25% resistance.\n*   The observed resistance (10%) is significantly lower than the expected additive result (25%). This type of interaction, where the double mutant has a more severe phenotype than expected by adding the effects of the single mutants, is called a **synergistic interaction**.\n*   Synergistic interactions often occur when two genes perform similar or overlapping functions in parallel pathways. This concept is known as **gene redundancy** (in this case, partial redundancy, since each single mutant has a phenotype). If G1 is knocked out, G3 can still provide some function, and vice versa. When both are knocked out, the pathway is much more severely compromised than a simple sum of their individual contributions would suggest.\n*   Therefore, we can conclude that **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the options based on the analysis**\n\nLet's check each option against our conclusions.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (resistance), so this cannot be concluded.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* Correct, as evidenced by the synergistic interaction.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* As noted above, this is technically incorrect based on the standard definition of masking epistasis. However, compared to other options, this choice has two strongly supported correct statements. The interaction between G1 and G3 is a form of epistasis in a broader quantitative sense (non-additive interaction), but the specific claim of G1 masking G3 is wrong. Despite this flaw, this option aligns best with the major findings.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* This is a possible molecular mechanism, but it cannot be concluded from this genetic data alone.\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* Incorrect. The epistasis data clearly shows G2 is upstream.\n    *   *G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Cannot be concluded.\n    *   *G2 is epistatic towards G1:* Correct, but the main premise of the option is wrong.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOption B provides the most accurate description of the gene interactions. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy based on their synergistic effect. While the third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is not accurate by the standard definition, the first two clauses represent the main, derivable conclusions from the experiment, making it the best available answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
