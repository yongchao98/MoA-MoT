    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Formation of Product A**\n\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone that can act as a Michael donor after being deprotonated.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The combination of these reactants points to a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has **no** α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. This is not a matter of choice between kinetic or thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site for enolate formation.\n    *   The structure of the starting ketone:\n        ```\n             O\n            // (1)\n           C -- C(Et)(Me) (2)\n          /  \\\n      (6)C(H)(Me) -- C (3)\n        |          |\n      (5)C -------- C (4)\n        ```\n    *   The t-BuOK removes the proton from C6, forming a nucleophilic enolate at C6.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The C6 enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 attacks the terminal CH₂ of the CH₂=CHCOOEt group. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   An intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated during the workup step to give the final stable product.\n    *   The group `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` is added to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n\n5.  **Structure and Name of Product A**\n    *   The resulting product has the following structure (original numbering for clarity):\n        ```\n             O=C1\n            /   \\\n        C2(Et,Me)-C3H₂\n        |           |\n    C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)----C4H₂\n         \\         /\n            C5H₂\n        ```\n    *   Now, we need to find the correct IUPAC name from the options. The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name in options B and D: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name implies the following structure for the cyclohexyl substituent:\n        *   The attachment to the propanoate chain is at **C1**.\n        *   C1 also has a **methyl** group.\n        *   The carbonyl (oxo) group is at **C2**.\n        *   C3 has an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Let's draw this structure:\n        ```\n               O=C2\n              /   \\\n        C1(Me, R) -- C3(Et, Me)   (where R is the -CH₂CH₂COOEt group)\n        |             |\n        C6H₂ -------- C4H₂\n         \\           /\n            C5H₂\n        ```\n    *   Comparing this structure with our predicted product, we see they are identical. The atoms are connected in the same way: `C(Et,Me)-C(=O)-C(Me,R)`. The numbering system is just different. The IUPAC naming convention for a ring as a substituent dictates that the point of attachment is C1, and other groups are numbered from there to give the lowest locants. This confirms that the structure of A is correctly described by the name in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Formation of Product B**\n\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the NO₂ group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) and can be removed by a base.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base sufficient to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is another **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Carbanion Formation**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. In `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the `CH` group next to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion intermediate is protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Name of Product B**\n    *   Let's assemble the final structure by connecting the pieces:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n        *   Combined structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile:\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options A and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct product names.\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A and B)\n\n<<<D>>>"
