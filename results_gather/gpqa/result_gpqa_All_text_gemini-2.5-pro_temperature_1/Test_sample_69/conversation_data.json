    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided chemical reactions to identify the compounds A through H.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.**\n    This reaction involves two gases forming a liquid solvent. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the reaction between sulfur dioxide and chlorine gas to form sulfuryl chloride:\n    `SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)`\n    Sulfuryl chloride (`SO₂Cl₂`) is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 69 °C) and is used as a solvent. This is a very strong candidate. Let's assign `D = SO₂`, `B = Cl₂`, and `H = SO₂Cl₂`. (The assignment of B and D could be swapped, but we will check this with other reactions).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> Bright red product C.**\n    Using our assignment from Step 1, `B = Cl₂`. The reaction is:\n    `A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    The 1:8 molar ratio is a very specific clue. Elemental sulfur exists as a solid crown-shaped molecule, `S₈`. The reaction of sulfur with chlorine can produce sulfur dichloride, `SCl₂`. Let's check the stoichiometry:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction has a 1:8 molar ratio between `A=S₈` and `B=Cl₂`. The product, `SCl₂`, is a cherry-red liquid, which matches the description \"bright red product C\". This identification seems very likely.\n    So, `A = S₈` and `C = SCl₂`.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G (F is strong, G is weak).**\n    Let's check if the hydrolysis of `C = SCl₂` matches this description. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is a disproportionation reaction:\n    `2SCl₂(l) + 2H₂O(l) -> S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    Let's analyze the products:\n    *   `S(s)`: This is elemental sulfur, which is `A` (`S₈`). So, A is reformed. This fits.\n    *   `HCl(aq)`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. This fits `F`.\n    *   `SO₂(g)`: Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), which is a weak acid. This fits `G`.\n    All conditions of Reaction 3 are met perfectly.\n\n*   **Summary of Identities:**\n    *   A = `S₈` (Sulfur)\n    *   B = `Cl₂` (Chlorine)\n    *   C = `SCl₂` (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   D = `SO₂` (Sulfur dioxide)\n    *   H = `SO₂Cl₂` (Sulfuryl chloride)\n    *   F = `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   G = `H₂SO₃` (Sulfurous acid)\n    This set of identifications is fully consistent with reactions 1, 3, and 4.\n\n**Step 2: Identify product E and determine its molecular symmetry.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> Extremely hazardous product E.**\n    Substituting the identities of C and D, we get:\n    `SCl₂ + 2SO₂ -> E`\n    This reaction is less common, but we must deduce the product E. E is described as \"extremely hazardous\". We also need to determine its molecular symmetry group from the given options: C₂, C₂v, D₄h, D∞h.\n\n*   **Deduce the identity and structure of E.**\n    While the exact reaction mechanism to a single product is obscure, let's consider plausible hazardous products that can be formed from S, O, and Cl atoms and have one of the given symmetries.\n    *   Several sulfur oxychlorides are known. Let's consider `SO₂Cl₂` (sulfuryl chloride), which we already identified as H. It is possible that E and H are the same compound, formed through different pathways.\n    *   Let's check if `E = SO₂Cl₂` is a plausible outcome. A balanced, albeit complex, reaction could be: `SCl₂ + 2SO₂ -> SO₂Cl₂ + S₂O₂`. Here, E (`SO₂Cl₂`) is produced.\n    *   Is `SO₂Cl₂` \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes, it is a toxic, corrosive, and water-reactive compound, fitting the description.\n    *   Now, let's determine the molecular symmetry of `SO₂Cl₂`.\n        *   The sulfur atom is central, bonded to two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms.\n        *   The geometry around the sulfur atom is approximately tetrahedral.\n        *   The molecule has a C₂ rotational axis that bisects both the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles.\n        *   The molecule has two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane contains the S and two Cl atoms, and the other contains the S and two O atoms.\n        *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the final answer.**\n\nThe compound E is identified as sulfuryl chloride (`SO₂Cl₂`). The molecular symmetry group for `SO₂Cl₂` is `C₂v`. This is one of the given options.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The 1:8 stoichiometry in Reaction 1 is a critical clue pointing towards `A=S₈` and `B=Cl₂`.\n2.  The hydrolysis products in Reaction 3 (reforming A, a strong acid, and a weak acid) strongly corroborate the identities derived from sulfur chemistry.\n3.  The reaction to form E is the most ambiguous part. However, by identifying all other species, we can make a plausible deduction for E. The most logical candidate among common hazardous sulfur compounds that fits the options for symmetry is `SO₂Cl₂`.\n4.  The fact that E and H might be the same compound (`SO₂Cl₂`) is not a contradiction, as they are produced via different chemical reactions.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (`SO₂Cl₂`) is C₂v.\n\n<<<B>>>"
