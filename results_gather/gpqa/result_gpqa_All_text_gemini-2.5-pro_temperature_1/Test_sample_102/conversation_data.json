    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene derivative.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: 1, 3, 5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS)**\n\nThe synthesis will involve a series of EAS reactions. The order in which the groups are added is crucial and depends on their directing effects:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** It is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), strongly deactivating, and a ***meta*-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** It is a strong EWG, strongly deactivating, and a ***meta*-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** It is a halogen, weakly deactivating, and an ***ortho, para*-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the General Synthesis Strategy**\n\n*   A critical consideration is the Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH3 group). This reaction **does not work** on benzene rings that are moderately or strongly deactivated. This means the ring cannot have a nitro group or multiple deactivating groups on it when the acylation is attempted. This strongly suggests that the acetyl group must be introduced early in the synthesis, or at least not last.\n*   The 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that a *meta*-director should be on the ring to direct the other substituents.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence:\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. It adds the acetyl group (-COCH3) to benzene. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good starting point for achieving a 1,3,5 pattern.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This successfully creates a 1,3-disubstituted product.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. We have two directing groups: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, *o,p*-director). The -COCH3 group directs the new group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In cases of conflict between a strong *meta*-director (like -COCH3) and a weak *o,p*-director (like -Br), the strong director often controls the position. The nitration predominantly occurs at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group. This step successfully produces the target molecule in high yield.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These subsequent steps (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) would modify the target product. However, the first three steps represent a valid and high-yield synthesis. It's common in multiple-choice questions for the correct option to contain the right pathway, even with extraneous steps listed.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv):** This sequence starts with nitrating benzene to nitrobenzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing aniline, and then treating it with H3PO2. The reaction of a diazonium salt with H3PO2 removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen (deamination). This sequence simply converts benzene back into benzene. It achieves nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene:** This step is fine.\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. Nitration will yield a mixture of *ortho* and *para* products, with the *para* product (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) being the major one.\n*   **Step iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The starting material has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2). The ring is strongly deactivated, and this reaction **will not proceed**. This sequence is not synthetically viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene:** This step is fine.\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. This is fine.\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) will react with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming an ammonium complex (-NH3+). This complex is a very strong deactivating group, and the Friedel-Crafts reaction **will not proceed**. This sequence is not synthetically viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain nonsensical or non-viable steps.\n*   Option A, in its first three steps, describes the most logical and chemically sound synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The strategy of introducing a *meta*-director first (-COCH3) and then adding the other substituents is correct for achieving the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The subsequent steps listed in option A are irrelevant to the synthesis of the target molecule but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial pathway.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
