    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure and key features:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is placed at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group is attached to C5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), which is a measure of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   One ring (the cyclohexene ring).\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the vinyl group.\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of these features: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction on oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\nHere's how it affects the functional groups in our starting material:\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: It gets fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: It gets fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C)**: Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are reduced to single bonds (C-C). The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **The ring structure itself remains intact.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reaction preserves the carbon skeleton but removes all multiple bonds and oxygen atoms, replacing them with hydrogen atoms until the molecule is fully saturated.\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (a saturated ring).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 becomes a **methyl** group.\n*   The **formyl** group at C2 becomes a **methyl** group.\n*   The **vinyl** group at C5 becomes an **ethyl** group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing a single ring.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD is calculated based on the number of rings and pi bonds in the final structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds)**: The product is fully saturated, meaning all the C=C and C=O bonds from the starting material have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The carbon skeleton is unchanged.\n*   C atoms in ring: 6\n*   C atom from -COOH: 1\n*   C atom from -CHO: 1\n*   C atoms from -CH=CH2: 2\n*   Total C atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\nUsing the IHD formula for a molecular formula (IHD = C + 1 - H/2):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe product of the reaction is a saturated cycloalkane. A molecule with a single ring and no multiple bonds has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  Identify the structure of the starting material: A cyclohexene ring with various functional groups.\n2.  Identify the effect of the reagent (Red P + HI): Complete reduction to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n3.  Determine the structure of the product: A substituted cyclohexane (a saturated, single-ring molecule).\n4.  Calculate the IHD of the product: A single ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Since there are no pi bonds, the total IHD is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
