    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n*   Initial nucleus: Mass M, at rest.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: E_M = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Process: Spontaneous fission into two fragments.\n*   Fragment rest-masses: m1 and m2. We are told one is twice as massive as the other. Let's define m1 as the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   Mass relationship: The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial rest-mass. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies) of the Fragments**\nIt's easier to work with rest-mass energies (like m*c²) throughout the problem.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²)\n    2.  (m1 + m2)*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    2*(m2*c²) + (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    m2*c² = 99 GeV.\n*   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n    m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe total energy is conserved. The energy released as kinetic energy (Q) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Initial Total Energy (nucleus at rest) = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Final Total Rest-Mass Energy = m1*c² + m2*c² = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Total Kinetic Energy (Q) = Initial Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy\n    Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n    This 3 GeV of energy is shared as kinetic energy between the two fragments.\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (The Correct Value)**\nWe must use conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest (momentum = 0). Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest-mass (m) by: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n*   We can write this for both fragments:\n    *   E1² = (p*c)² + (m1*c²)²\n    *   E2² = (p*c)² + (m2*c²)²\n    Since `(p*c)²` is the same for both, we have:\n    E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy (E1 + E2) must equal the total initial energy (M*c²).\n    E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations. Rearrange the momentum equation:\n    E1² - E2² = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n*   Substitute the known values: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, m1*c² = 198 GeV, m2*c² = 99 GeV.\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403\n    E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   We now have a simple linear system:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1:\n    2*E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c²:\n    T1 (correct) = E1 - m1*c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**5. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\nIn the classical approximation, we distribute the same total kinetic energy (Q = 3 GeV) using classical formulas.\n*   **Kinetic Energy Formula:** T = p² / (2m).\n*   From conservation of momentum, the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1 / T2 = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2.\n    So, T1 (classical) / T2 (classical) = 1/2, which means T2 (classical) = 2 * T1 (classical).\n*   The total kinetic energy is still Q = 3 GeV:\n    T1 (classical) + T2 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    T1 (classical) + 2 * T1 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    T1 (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (correct) - T1 (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\n**7. Convert to Final Units (MeV)**\nThe answer options are in MeV.\n*   1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the two calculated values is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
