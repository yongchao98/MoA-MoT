    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting materials and the product.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (SM):** The options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's draw its structure.\n    *   The backbone is a pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) derivative.\n    *   It has an ethyl group at C3: HOOC¹-CH₂²-C³H(Et)-CH₂⁴-C⁵OOH.\n    *   One of the carboxylic acids is esterified with isobutanol. The name \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid at C5 is the one esterified.\n    *   Structure: HOOC¹-CH₂²-C³H(Et)-CH₂⁴-C⁵(=O)O-iBu.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3.\n\n*   **Product (P):** The product is either (R)- or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n    *   The \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring with one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at position 2 (next to the ring oxygen).\n    *   An ethyl group is at position 4.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C4.\n    *   The formation of this lactone requires a molecule of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which then undergoes intramolecular esterification.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities for the substituents at the chiral centers.**\n\n*   **At C3 of the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    a) -H\n    b) -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n    c) -CH₂COOH (carboxyl group side)\n    d) -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu (ester group side)\n\n    To determine the priorities of (c) and (d), we look at the atoms attached to the carbon of the -CH₂- group. Both are carbons. We then look at what those carbons are attached to.\n    *   For -CH₂-**C**OOH: This carbon is attached to an -OH group and a =O group. Using the phantom atom method, this is equivalent to being attached to three oxygen atoms: (O, O, O).\n    *   For -CH₂-**C**(=O)O-iBu: This carbon is attached to an -O-iBu group and a =O group. The ether oxygen is attached to a carbon. So this is equivalent to being attached to (O, O, C).\n    *   Comparing (O, O, O) and (O, O, C), the first point of difference is the third atom. Oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon. Therefore, the -CH₂COOH group has higher priority than the -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group.\n    *   The priority order at C3 is:\n        1.  -CH₂COOH\n        2.  -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃\n        4.  -H\n\n*   **At C4 of the Product:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    a) -H\n    b) -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n    c) -CH₂-C(=O)O- (the part of the ring leading to the carbonyl)\n    d) -CH₂-CH₂-O- (the part of the ring leading to the ether oxygen)\n\n    To determine the priorities of (c) and (d), we look at the atoms along each path.\n    *   Path (c): C4 -> C3 -> C2. The C2 atom is a carbonyl carbon, attached to two oxygens.\n    *   Path (d): C4 -> C5 -> C6. The C6 atom is a methylene carbon, attached to one oxygen.\n    *   Comparing the atoms attached to the second carbon in each chain (C2 vs C6), C2 (bonded to O, O) takes priority over C6 (bonded to O, H, H).\n    *   The priority order at C4 is:\n        1.  -CH₂-C(=O)O-\n        2.  -CH₂-CH₂-O-\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃\n        4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols but reacts very slowly with carboxylic acids. Thus, it will selectively reduce the isobutoxycarbonyl group.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu is reduced at the ester group to give 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH.\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product. The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) attacks the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3).\n    *   Let's see how the substituents' priorities change.\n        *   The -CH₂COOH group (Priority 1 in SM) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- group in the product ring (Priority 1 in P).\n        *   The -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group (Priority 2 in SM) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-O- group in the product ring (Priority 2 in P).\n    *   Since the priority order of the substituents around the chiral center is preserved (1→1, 2→2, 3→3), the stereochemical configuration is **retained**.\n    *   To obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have an (R)-configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols much faster than it reduces esters. Thus, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu is reduced at the acid group to give isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu.\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification (lactonization). The new hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3).\n    *   Let's see how the substituents' priorities change.\n        *   The -CH₂COOH group (Priority 1 in SM) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-O- group in the product ring (Priority 2 in P).\n        *   The -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group (Priority 2 in SM) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- group in the product ring (Priority 1 in P).\n    *   The priorities of the two highest-ranked substituents are **swapped** (SM Priority 1 → P Priority 2; SM Priority 2 → P Priority 1).\n    *   When the priorities of two groups are swapped while their spatial arrangement remains the same, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must have an (R)-configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the same compound: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
