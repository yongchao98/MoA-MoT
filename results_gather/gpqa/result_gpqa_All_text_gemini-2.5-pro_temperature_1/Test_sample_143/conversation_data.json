    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nWe are asked to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. We are given the following information:\n*   Total energy of the particle in the lab frame: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (Note: In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy, representing $mc^2$)\n*   Decay width of the particle: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n1.  **Mean Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The decay width ($\\Gamma$) of an unstable particle is related to its mean lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, as its total energy ($8 \\text{ GeV}$) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($1.2 \\text{ GeV}$). Therefore, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n\n4.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$):\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau'$\n    Since $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light $c$) and $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, the formula becomes:\n    $L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma (c\\tau)$\n\n5.  **Useful Combination ($\\beta\\gamma$):** The product $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass.\n    We know that $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n    So, $pc = \\beta\\gamma (mc^2)$.\n    Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n6.  **Constants and Units:** We need to be consistent with units. It's convenient to work in units of MeV and fm (femtometers).\n    *   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (a very useful constant in particle physics)\n    *   $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Convert all energies to a consistent unit (MeV).**\n*   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1.2 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$ (already in MeV)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean proper lifetime multiplied by c ($c\\tau$).**\nUsing the formula $\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$, we can write $c\\tau = \\hbar c / \\Gamma$.\n*   $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.3 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.61656 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the factor $\\beta\\gamma$.**\nUsing the formula $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$:\n*   $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}}$\n*   $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000}}{1200} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200}$\n*   $\\beta\\gamma \\approx \\frac{7909.5}{1200} \\approx 6.59125$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$).**\nUsing the formula $L = \\beta\\gamma \\cdot (c\\tau)$:\n*   $L \\approx (6.59125) \\times (0.61656 \\text{ fm})$\n*   $L \\approx 4.0640 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**Step 5: Convert the result to meters.**\nSince $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n*   $L \\approx 4.0640 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it most closely matches option C. For higher precision:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{62560000}}{1200} \\times \\frac{197.327}{320} \\text{ fm} \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.616647 \\text{ fm} \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm} = 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$.\nThis result is an exact match for option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
