    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical transformation.**\nThe reagents used are sodium nitrite (NaNO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H2O). The combination of NaNO2 and HCl generates nitrous acid (HNO2) *in situ*.\nThe overall reaction is the treatment of a compound with nitrous acid in an acidic aqueous medium. The products in both cases are α-diketones (compounds with two adjacent carbonyl groups). This specific transformation—the conversion of a ketone into an α-diketone—is a known reaction. It proceeds by the oxidation of a methylene group (CH₂) or a methine group (CH) located at the α-position (adjacent) to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nThe general reaction is:\nR-CO-CH₂-R' + HNO₂ → R-CO-C(=O)-R' + N₂ + H₂O (This is a simplified overall equation; the mechanism is more complex).\n\nThe mechanism involves the following key steps:\n1.  Formation of an enol from the starting ketone under acidic conditions.\n2.  Attack of the enol on the nitrosonium ion (NO⁺), which is generated from HNO₂. This forms an α-nitroso ketone.\n3.  The α-nitroso ketone tautomerizes to a more stable α-keto oxime.\n4.  The α-keto oxime is hydrolyzed by water under acidic conditions to yield the α-diketone product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of the first product.**\n*   **Reaction:** A + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) → 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is a cyclic α-diketone. The carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Deduce the Starting Material (A):** Based on the reaction mechanism, the product is formed by oxidizing an α-methylene group of a ketone. To get a diketone at positions 1 and 2, the starting material must have had a single carbonyl group at either position 1 or 2, with a methylene (CH₂) group at the adjacent position. Both possibilities lead to the same starting material: **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   **Verification:** In 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, the carbonyl group is at C1. The α-positions are C2 and C6. Both are methylene (CH₂) groups. The reaction will occur at one of these positions (e.g., C2) to introduce a second carbonyl group, yielding the desired product, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. The other options for A, like 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, are alcohols and would not undergo this specific reaction to form a diketone.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of the second product.**\n*   **Reaction:** B + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) → 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. This is an acyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at C2 and C3.\n*   **Deduce the Starting Material (B):** Following the same logic, the starting material must have been a ketone that was oxidized at an adjacent methylene or methine group. To form carbonyls at C2 and C3, the original ketone must have had a carbonyl group at either C2 or C3.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** The starting material is a ketone at C2, i.e., **5-methylhexan-2-one** (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂). This molecule has an α-methylene group at C3. Oxidation at C3 would convert the -CH₂- group into a carbonyl group, yielding the product 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is a very plausible pathway.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** The starting material is a ketone at C3, i.e., 5-methylhexan-3-one (CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂). This molecule has α-methylene groups at both C2 and C4. Reaction at C2 would yield the desired product. However, 5-methylhexan-2-one is one of the options provided, making it the most likely candidate.\n*   **Verification:** The other option for B, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, is a diol. Diols do not react with nitrous acid to form diketones; this reaction requires specific oxidizing agents not present here. Therefore, 5-methylhexan-2-one is the correct starting material for B.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n*   Our analysis shows that starting material A is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   Our analysis shows that starting material B is 5-methylhexan-2-one.\n\nNow, we check the given options:\nA) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one. (A is incorrect)\nB) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. (B is incorrect)\nC) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one. (This matches our findings for both A and B)\nD) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. (Both are incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
