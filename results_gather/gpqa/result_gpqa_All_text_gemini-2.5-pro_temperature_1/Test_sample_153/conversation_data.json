    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the molecule.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%).\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine (Cl) atom in the molecule. The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from a typical non-conjugated value of ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (>10 ppm):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Expected, as this proton is not adjacent to any other protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8.5 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating they are protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two chemically equivalent protons. This means the benzene ring has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Each signal is a doublet, meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern—two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons—is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   From **MS**, we know the compound has MW = 156 and contains one Cl atom.\n*   From **IR** and **¹H NMR**, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From **¹H NMR**, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the *para* (1,4) positions. This compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   MW (C₇H₅ClO₂) = 156.5 g/mol. Correct.\n    *   Contains one Cl. Correct.\n    *   Is a carboxylic acid. Correct.\n    *   Is *para*-disubstituted, which matches the NMR pattern. Correct. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** No carboxylic acid group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid (NMR peak at 11.0 ppm rules this out). The aromatic NMR pattern would be much more complex (three different protons). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-disubstituted ring. It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets of 2H each. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
