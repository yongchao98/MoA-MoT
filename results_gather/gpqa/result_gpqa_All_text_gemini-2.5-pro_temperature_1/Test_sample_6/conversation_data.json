    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the interaction between a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$). This interaction results in pair production, creating an electron ($e^{-}$) and a positron ($e^{+}$). The reaction is:\n    $$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+} $$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Threshold Condition:**\n    For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the particles being created. The minimum energy required for the reaction is called the threshold energy. At this threshold, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the CM frame.\n    *   The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$. The rest mass of a positron is also $m_e$.\n    *   The total rest mass energy of the products is $m_{e^{-}}c^2 + m_{e^{+}}c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the threshold condition in the CM frame is: $E_{CM, total} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Invariance:**\n    A key principle in special relativity is that the square of the total four-momentum of a system is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames. This quantity is often denoted as $s$. We can calculate $s$ in both the laboratory frame and the CM frame and set them equal.\n    *   In the CM frame, at threshold: $s = (E_{CM, total})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n    *   In the lab frame, $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 c^4$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the four-momenta of the two photons. For photons, $p^2 = m^2 = 0$. The invariant simplifies to $s = 2(p_1 \\cdot p_2)c^4$.\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $E_\\gamma$ is the energy of the high-energy photon, $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, and $\\theta$ is the angle between their directions of travel.\n    *   Thus, in the lab frame: $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Threshold Energy Formula:**\n    By equating the expressions for $s$ from both frames, we get:\n    $$ (2m_e c^2)^2 = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n    The question asks \"from what energy\" the lifetime is limited, which implies we are looking for the lowest possible energy for the gamma-ray that can initiate this process. This minimum energy threshold, $E_{\\gamma, th}$, occurs when the collision is most efficient. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized for a head-on collision, where $\\theta = \\pi$ (180Â°). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $$ (2m_e c^2)^2 = 2E_{\\gamma, th} E_{CMB}(2) $$\n    $$ 4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_{\\gamma, th} E_{CMB} $$\n    Solving for the threshold energy $E_{\\gamma, th}$:\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Threshold Energy:** The calculation is for the *minimum* energy required for the reaction. This occurs under the most favorable condition, which is a head-on collision.\n*   **Constants:** We need the values for the rest mass energy of an electron and the energy of a CMB photon.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron: $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average CMB photon energy (given): $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent. We will perform the calculation in electron-volts (eV) and then convert the final answer to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), as required by the options ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  **Substitute the physical constants into the formula:**\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the numerator:**\n    $$ (0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2 = (0.511)^2 \\times (10^6)^2 \\text{ eV}^2 \\approx 0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2 $$\n\n3.  **Perform the division:**\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n4.  **Express in standard scientific notation:**\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n5.  **Convert the energy from eV to GeV:**\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
