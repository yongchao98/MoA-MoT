    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 2 vs. level 1, denoted as `N2/N1`) changes when the star's effective temperature drops due to spots. Specifically, we need to calculate `(N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a critical assumption because it allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the population of atomic energy levels. The Boltzmann equation is:\n    `N2 / N1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N2 / N1` is the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1.\n    *   `g2 / g1` is the ratio of the statistical weights of the two levels. This is a constant for a given pair of energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`~1.381 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the States and Formulate the Factor:**\n    *   **State 1 (No Spots):** The temperature is `T1 = T_no_spots = 6000 K`.\n        The ratio is `R1 = (N2/N1)_no_spots = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T1))`.\n    *   **State 2 (With Spots):** The temperature is `T2 = T_with_spots = 5500 K`.\n        The ratio is `R2 = (N2/N1)_with_spots = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T2))`.\n\n    The factor we need to find is the ratio of `R1` to `R2`:\n    `Factor = R1 / R2 = [(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T1))] / [(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T2))]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   The `(g2/g1)` term is constant and cancels out. This is a crucial point, meaning we don't need to know the specific values for the statistical weights.\n    *   Using the exponential rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we can simplify the expression:\n        `Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T1) - (-ΔE / (k * T2)) ]`\n        `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Values:**\n    *   **Energy Term (`ΔE/k`):** The energy difference `ΔE` is not given directly, but we can calculate it from the wavelength of the transition, `λ = 1448 Å`.\n        *   The energy of a photon is `ΔE = hc / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant (`~6.626 x 10^-34 J·s`) and `c` is the speed of light (`~3.00 x 10^8 m/s`).\n        *   First, convert the wavelength to SI units: `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m`.\n        *   Calculate `ΔE`:\n            `ΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s * 3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (1448 x 10^-10 m) ≈ 1.373 x 10^-18 J`\n        *   Now, find the value of `ΔE/k`:\n            `ΔE/k = (1.373 x 10^-18 J) / (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 99406 K`\n\n    *   **Temperature Term (`1/T2 - 1/T1`):**\n        *   `T1 = 6000 K`\n        *   `T2 = 5500 K`\n        *   `1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1/5500 - 1/6000`\n        *   Find a common denominator: `(6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹ ≈ 1.515 x 10^-5 K⁻¹`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Factor:**\n    *   Substitute the calculated values back into the simplified formula:\n        `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]`\n        `Factor = exp[ 99406 K * (500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹) ]`\n        `Factor = exp[ 1.50615... ]`\n    *   Calculate the exponential:\n        `Factor ≈ 4.509`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **LTE Assumption:** The entire calculation relies on the validity of the Boltzmann equation, which is justified by the LTE assumption.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's radius (1.5 R_sun), mass (1.1 M_sun), and the spot coverage (40%) are context but are not needed for the final calculation because the initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n*   **Cancellation of Statistical Weights:** It is important to realize that the ratio of statistical weights `g2/g1` cancels out when you take the ratio of the population ratios. You do not need to look up these values for Titanium.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All constants and variables must be in a consistent system of units (e.g., SI) for the calculation to be correct.\n*   **Interpretation:** The question asks for the factor `(ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots)`. Since the temperature is higher without spots, the population of the higher energy level (level 2) will be greater. Therefore, the factor must be greater than 1. Our result of ~4.5 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe final result of the calculation is `~4.509`. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~2.9\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~1.1\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **4.5**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
