    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that the 2-electron system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state. This state is given in the $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ notation as $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome for electron 1 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome for electron 2 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Translate the Measurement Outcome into Quantum States:**\n    The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n    *   For the measurement of $L_{1z}$ to yield $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 must be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the measurement of $L_{2z}$ to yield $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 must be $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state defined by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rules of Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    A fundamental principle when coupling angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Total operator: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    *   Relationship between quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This relationship is a **selection rule**. It means that a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can only be composed of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. If this condition is not met, the uncoupled state has no contribution to the coupled state, and the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Specific Case:**\n    *   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   We compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state:\n        $-2 \\neq -1$\n\n6.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ when it is initially in the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied for our case, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is necessarily zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of obtaining this measurement outcome is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The connection between them is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The $m = m_1 + m_2$ Selection Rule:** This is the most crucial point. It allows solving the problem instantly without calculating any specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. It's a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the coupling process.\n*   **Eigenvalues and Quantum Numbers:** Be careful to correctly translate the given eigenvalue ($-\\hbar$) into the corresponding magnetic quantum number ($m = -1$).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe initial state of the system is $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\nThe measurement asks for the joint probability of finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers to be $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\nThe sum of these individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\nIn this case, $m = -1$ and the sum $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is not a component of the initial state.\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
