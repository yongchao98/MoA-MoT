    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome (0) when observing a quantum system. In the formalism of quantum mechanics, this involves several key steps:\n*   Identifying the state of the system (`|ψ>`).\n*   Identifying the observable operator (`P`).\n*   Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator `P`. The eigenvalues represent the possible measurement outcomes.\n*   Calculating the probability using the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to the desired outcome.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (ket vector):\n    `|ψ> = [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix operator `P`:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The desired measurement outcome (eigenvalue) is `λ = 0`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\nTo find the possible outcomes of the measurement, we must find the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n`P - λI = [[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]`\n\nThe determinant is:\n`det(P - λI) = -λ * ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2) * ((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) + 0`\n`= -λ * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2)`\n`= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2`\n`= -λ³ + λ`\n`= λ(1 - λ²)`\n`= λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ)`\n\nSetting the determinant to zero, `λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`, we find the eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = 0`, `λ₂ = 1`, `λ₃ = -1`.\nSince 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Eigenvector for the Outcome λ = 0**\nNow, we need to find the eigenvector `|φ₀>` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. We solve the equation `P|φ₀> = 0|φ₀>`, which simplifies to `P|φ₀> = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|φ₀>` be `[[x], [y], [z]]`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis matrix multiplication gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0`  => `(1/√2)y = 0` => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0` => `(1/√2)(x + z) = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0` (This is the same as the first equation)\n\nFrom these equations, we know `y = 0` and `x = -z`. We can choose a value for `x` to define the eigenvector. Let's choose `x = 1`, which means `z = -1`.\nSo, an unnormalized eigenvector `|φ₀_un>` corresponding to `λ=0` is:\n`|φ₀_un> = [[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |<φ_λ|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\nwhere `|φ_λ>` is the eigenvector corresponding to `λ`. We can use the unnormalized eigenvector found in the previous step, but we must also account for its norm in the formula. The general formula using unnormalized vectors is:\n`Prob(λ) = |<φ_λ_un|ψ>|^2 / (<φ_λ_un|φ_λ_un> * <ψ|ψ>)`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   **<ψ|ψ>**: The squared norm of the state vector.\n    `|ψ> = [[-1], [2], [1]]`, so `<ψ| = [-1, 2, 1]`.\n    `<ψ|ψ> = (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   **<φ₀_un|φ₀_un>**: The squared norm of the unnormalized eigenvector.\n    `|φ₀_un> = [[1], [0], [-1]]`, so `<φ₀_un| = [1, 0, -1]`.\n    `<φ₀_un|φ₀_un> = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **|<φ₀_un|ψ>|^2**: The squared magnitude of the inner product of `|ψ>` and `|φ₀_un>`.\n    `<φ₀_un|ψ> = [1, 0, -1] * [[-1], [2], [1]] = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`.\n    `|<φ₀_un|ψ>|^2 = (-2)² = 4`.\n\nNow, plug these values into the probability formula:\n`Prob(λ=0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0 is **1/3**.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
