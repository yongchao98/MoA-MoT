    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Physical Model**\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. This setup is a classic example of a source that can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The oscillation of charges along the symmetry axis (z-axis) creates an oscillating electric dipole moment, $\\vec{p}(t)$, directed along the z-axis. The radiation from such a dipole is the most fundamental type of electromagnetic radiation from a localized source.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, $dP/d\\Omega$, in the radiation zone is given by the formula:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = K \\sin^2\\theta $\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and $K$ is a factor that depends on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, but not on the angle $\\theta$.\n\nThe problem states that this power per unit solid angle is a function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ and that its maximum value is $A$.\nThe maximum value of the function occurs when the $\\sin^2\\theta$ term is maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin^2\\theta$ is 1, which happens when $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, the maximum power is:\n$ A = (\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega})_{max} = K \\cdot (\\sin^2(90^\\circ)) = K \\cdot 1 = K $\n\nThus, we can write the power at any angle $\\theta$ in terms of the maximum power $A$:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}(\\theta) = A \\sin^2\\theta $\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Fraction of Power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$**\nWe are asked to find the fraction of the maximum power $A$ that is radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. We can calculate this by substituting $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ into our expression:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}(30^\\circ) = A \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $\n\nWe know the value of $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$.\nTherefore, $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nSo, the power radiated at $30^\\circ$ is:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}(30^\\circ) = A \\cdot (1/4) = \\frac{A}{4} $\nThe fraction of $A$ radiated at this angle is $1/4$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Wavelength Dependence**\nNow we need to determine the dependence of the radiated power function, $f(\\lambda, \\theta) = dP/d\\Omega$, on the wavelength $\\lambda$.\nThe full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\mu_0 p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 c} \\sin^2\\theta $\nHere, $p_0$ is the amplitude of the dipole moment, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi \\nu = 2\\pi (c/\\lambda)$, where $\\nu$ is the frequency.\nFrom the formula, we can see the power is proportional to $\\omega^4$:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 $\n\nSubstituting the relation between $\\omega$ and $\\lambda$:\n$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\left(\\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} = \\lambda^{-4} $\nTherefore, a possible form for the function $f$ involves a dependence on wavelength as $\\lambda^{-4}$. This is a famous result, also known from the theory of Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Step 5: Combine Results and Choose the Correct Option**\n*   The fraction of maximum power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is $1/4$.\n*   The dependence of the power function on wavelength is $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$\nB) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$\nC) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$\nD) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$\n\nOption (C) correctly identifies both the fraction ($1/4$) and the wavelength dependence ($\\lambda^{-4}$).\n\n<<<C>>>"
