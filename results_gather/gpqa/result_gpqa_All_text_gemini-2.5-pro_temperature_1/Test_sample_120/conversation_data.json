    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze and Draw the Reactant Structure\nThe reactant is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6, and the oxygen is atom 7. This is a derivative of cyclohexene oxide.\n2.  **Substituents**: `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute configuration of the chiral centers. To satisfy all these configurations simultaneously, we must determine the orientation of the epoxide and the methyl groups.\n    *   Let's assume the cyclohexane ring is in a chair-like conformation.\n    *   A careful analysis of the R/S configurations reveals the following structure:\n        *   The epoxide ring is on the **alpha face** (pointing down).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is on the **beta face** (pointing up).\n\n    *   **Verification of Stereocenters:**\n        *   **C1 (1R)**: Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the epoxide down (alpha) and Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n        *   **C6 (6S)**: Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the epoxide down (alpha) and H up (beta), the configuration is S.\n        *   **C3 (3R)**: Priorities C2 > C4 > Me > H. With Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n        *   **C4 (4R)**: Priorities C3 > C5 > Me > H. With Me up (beta), the configuration is R.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction\n*   **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a \"soft\" methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction**: Organocuprates react with epoxides in an SN2-type nucleophilic ring-opening reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity\n*   The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n*   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity\n*   The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond).\n*   The epoxide ring is on the alpha face (down). So, the C6-O bond is pointing downwards.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the **beta face (up)**. This is called *anti*-attack.\n*   The SN2 reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Product Structure\n1.  **Attack at C6**: A new methyl group adds to C6 from the beta face (up).\n2.  **Inversion at C6**: The hydrogen atom originally at C6 (beta, up) is pushed to the alpha face (down).\n3.  **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n4.  **Work-up**: The resulting alkoxide ion at C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was alpha (down), the OH group will be on the alpha face (down).\n5.  **Spectator Groups**: The methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected and retain their beta (up) orientation.\n\n*   **Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The OH group is at C1 (alpha, down).\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is beta (up).\n    *   The new methyl group at C6 is beta (up).\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is beta (up).\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is beta (up).\n    *   In conclusion, all four methyl groups are *cis* to each other (beta/up), and the hydroxyl group is *trans* to all of them (alpha/down).\n\n### Step 6: Name the Product and Assign Absolute Configurations\n1.  **IUPAC Numbering**: The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To give the substituents the lowest locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Old C1 → New C1 (has OH, Me)\n    *   Old C6 → New C2 (has Me)\n    *   Old C5 → New C3\n    *   Old C4 → New C4 (has Me)\n    *   Old C3 → New C5 (has Me)\n    *   The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n2.  **Assign R/S Configuration**: We assign the absolute configuration to each chiral center (C1, C2, C4, C5) based on the 3D structure derived in Step 5.\n    *   **C1**: Attached to OH (down), Me (up), C2, C6. Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C2**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C1, C3. Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **S**. (Note: SN2 inversion occurred, but due to changes in substituent priorities, the S descriptor of reactant C6 remains S for product C2).\n    *   **C4**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C3, C5. Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C5**: Attached to Me (up), H (down), C4, C6. Priorities: C6 > C4 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n\n3.  **Final Product Name**: The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Step 7: Compare with Options\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived structure and name.**\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
