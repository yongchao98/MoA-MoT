    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core chemical process**\n\nWe are dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong acid (let's denote it as HA, which provides H⁺ ions). The reaction is a neutralization reaction:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid needed to dissolve the solid. This means we want to reach a state where all the solid Fe(OH)₃ has just turned into aqueous Fe³⁺ ions. This final solution will be at equilibrium, governed by the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass (Fe) = 55.85 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (O) = 16.00 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (H) = 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction (stoichiometric amount)**\n\nFrom the balanced reaction `Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → ...`, we see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * 0.0009356 mol = 0.002807 mol\n\nThis is the amount of acid needed just to neutralize the hydroxide. However, the resulting solution must also be acidic enough to keep the Fe³⁺ ions from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃. This means there must be some excess H⁺ remaining in the solution at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the final state to the options provided**\n\nThe total amount of acid added serves two purposes:\n1.  Reacting with the Fe(OH)₃ (calculated in Step 3).\n2.  Establishing the final acidic pH of the 100 cm³ solution (this is the excess H⁺).\n\nTotal moles of H⁺ added = (Moles of H⁺ reacted) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining at equilibrium)\n\nSince we are given pairs of (pH, Volume), we can test which pair is self-consistent. Let's test option C.\n\n**Step 5: Test Option C (pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³)**\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining at equilibrium based on the given pH.**\n    If the final pH is 2.69, the final hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] is:\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ = 0.00204 M\n    The final volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ remaining = Concentration × Volume = 0.00204 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must have been added.**\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = (Moles of H⁺ reacted) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining)\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = 0.003011 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to provide this many moles.**\n    The acid concentration is 0.1 M (or 0.1 mol/L).\n    *   Volume of acid = Total moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n    *   Volume of acid = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L\n\n4.  **Convert the volume to cm³ and compare with the option.**\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.03011 L × 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is extremely close to the 30.09 cm³ given in option C. The minor difference is due to rounding during intermediate steps or in the provided values. This strong agreement indicates that option C is the correct answer.\n\nFor completeness, testing other options would show a significant mismatch between the calculated volume and the given volume. For example, for option A (pH=2.04), the calculated volume would be ~37.2 cm³, which does not match 28.05 cm³.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary**\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.88 = 0.0009356 mol\n*   Moles of H⁺ to react = 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol\n*   Moles of H⁺ in final solution (assuming pH 2.69) = 10⁻².⁶⁹ * 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   Total moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = 30.11 cm³\n*   This matches the values in Option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
