    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given IR and 1H NMR data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak):** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong peak):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the fingerprint region and are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to one proton, located very far downfield. This is the classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded because they are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Let's piece together the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the first fragment. It is adjacent to the -CH₃ group (3H) and the methine (-CH-) group (1H), which would make it a multiplet (quartet of doublets or similar).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift (~2.9 ppm) indicates it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is adjacent to the -CH₃ group (3H) from the second fragment and the -CH₂- group (2H), which would make it a multiplet (quartet of quartets or similar complex multiplet).\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   One substituent is a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   The other substituent is an alkyl group. Combining the fragments: The benzylic CH is attached to a CH₃ and a CH₂CH₃ group. The full alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and HI.\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   -COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> -CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   This reagent is strong enough to reduce the carboxylic acid all the way to an alkane functional group.\n    *   The alkyl substituent (sec-butyl group) is an alkane chain and will not be affected by these reducing conditions.\n    *   The aromatic ring is also stable and will not be reduced under these conditions.\n*   **Predicting the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The -COOH group at position 1 is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   The final product is a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.\n    *   The name of this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This structure matches our predicted final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group. The reaction does not cause skeletal rearrangement of the alkyl chain.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an isomer of the starting material, not the product.\n\nThe correct identification of the starting material and the correct understanding of the reduction reaction lead to the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
