    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the numerical value of “a”.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Principle**\nThe fundamental concept we need to use here is the **normalization condition** from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding a particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all space.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Components**\n1.  **Wave Function (ψ(x)):** The problem gives us the wave function:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n2.  **Probability Density (|ψ(x)|²):** The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the complex wave function. For a complex number z = R + iI, the squared magnitude is |z|² = R² + I².\n    In our case, the real part is R = a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is I = -0.5.\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Integration Limits:** The problem states that particles are *only* found between x=1 and x=3. This means the probability of finding a particle outside this interval is zero. Therefore, we must perform our integration over this specific range. The limits of integration are from 1 to 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The number of systems (10,000) is extraneous information. The normalization condition applies to the wave function of a single particle, and the constant \"a\" will be the same for all identical systems.\n*   The wave function is a complex number. We must calculate the squared modulus |ψ(x)|² correctly, which is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.\n*   The integration must be performed over the specified domain [1, 3], not over all possible space from -∞ to +∞.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Normalization Equation**\nUsing the components defined above, we can write the normalization equation:\n∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nSubstituting the expression for the probability density:\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Integral**\nWe can split the integral into two parts for easier calculation:\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First Integral:**\n    ∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx = a² ∫₁³ [ 1 / (1 + x) ] dx\n    The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    = a² [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n    = a² [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n    = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2)\n    = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Second Integral:**\n    ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n    = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n    = 0.25 * 2\n    = 0.5\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \"a\"**\nNow, we substitute the results of the integrals back into our normalization equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nIsolate the term with a²:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nSolve for a²:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nFinally, take the square root to find \"a\" (we take the positive root by convention for a normalization constant):\na = sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is extremely close to 0.85.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated value for \"a\" is approximately 0.85, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
