    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principle: Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force ($F=-kx$), which means the total energy of the system is conserved. In relativistic mechanics, we must use the relativistic expressions for energy. The conserved quantity is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n\n$E_{total} = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n**2. Define the Energy Components**\n\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle of rest mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n    $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy is the integral of the force with respect to position, with a negative sign:\n    $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n**3. Set up the Energy Conservation Equation**\n\nThe total energy $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is constant throughout the oscillation. We can find the value of this constant energy by evaluating it at a point where we know all the variables.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n\nA convenient point is the maximum amplitude, $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is zero.\n*   Position: $x = A$\n*   Speed: $v = 0$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n*   Kinetic Energy: $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$\n*   Potential Energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nThe total energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = K + U = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy at Maximum Speed**\n\nThe maximum speed, $v_{max}$, occurs when the kinetic energy is maximum. This happens when the potential energy is minimum.\n*   Position: $x = 0$ (where potential energy is minimum)\n*   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n*   Kinetic Energy: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n*   Potential Energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n\nAt this point, the total energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = K_{max} + U(0) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n**6. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at maximum speed.\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNext, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to solve for $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n$\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\nInvert both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange to isolate the $v_{max}^2/c^2$ term:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, take the square root and multiply by $c$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativistic Energy:** It is crucial to use the relativistic form of kinetic energy, $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, not the classical one, $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.\n2.  **Conserved Quantity:** The conserved quantity is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, $K+U$. Adding the constant rest energy $mc^2$ to define a total energy $E' = \\gamma mc^2 + U$ is also valid and leads to the same result, as the constant $mc^2$ appears on both sides of the conservation equation.\n3.  **Maximum Speed Condition:** The maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium position ($x=0$), where the potential energy is at its minimum.\n4.  **Maximum Amplitude Condition:** At the maximum amplitude ($x=A$), the object is momentarily at rest ($v=0$), and all the system's mechanical energy is stored as potential energy.\n5.  **Classical Limit Check:** As a check, if we let $c \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\to 0$. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$, our result for $v_{max}$ correctly reduces to the classical result $v_{max} = \\sqrt{kA^2/m}$. This gives confidence in the relativistic formula.\n\nComparing our final expression with the given options, we see that it matches option D.\n\n$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n<<<D>>>"
