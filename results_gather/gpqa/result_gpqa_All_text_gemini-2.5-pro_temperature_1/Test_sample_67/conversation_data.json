    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.\n\n**1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`. The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ_vec . B_vec = -γ(S_vec) . (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`.\n    *   `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n**2. Define the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)**\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B'_vec = B * y_hat` is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ_vec . B'_vec = -γ(S_vec) . (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Time Evolution of the State**\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`. We want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩`, where `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. A very effective method for this is to use the Heisenberg picture or Ehrenfest's theorem.\n\n**Method: Using the Equations of Motion for Expectation Values (Ehrenfest's Theorem)**\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by:\n`d/dt ⟨A⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[A, H]⟩`\n\nLet's apply this to `⟨S_z⟩` and `⟨S_x⟩`:\n*   **For `⟨S_z⟩`:**\n    `d/dt ⟨S_z⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_z, -γB * S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_z, S_y]⟩`\n    Using the spin commutator relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n    `d/dt ⟨S_z⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨-iħS_x⟩ = γB⟨S_x⟩`  --- (Equation 1)\n\n*   **For `⟨S_x⟩`:**\n    `d/dt ⟨S_x⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, H]⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨[S_x, -γB * S_y]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S_x, S_y]⟩`\n    Using the spin commutator relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`.\n    `d/dt ⟨S_x⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨iħS_z⟩ = -γB⟨S_z⟩` --- (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Solve the Coupled Differential Equations**\n\nWe now have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n`d²/dt² ⟨S_z⟩ = γB * (d/dt ⟨S_x⟩)`\n\nNow, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n`d²/dt² ⟨S_z⟩ = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n\nRearranging this gives the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n`d²/dt² ⟨S_z⟩ + (γB)²⟨S_z⟩ = 0`\n\nThe general solution is `⟨S_z⟩(t) = A*cos(ωt) + C*sin(ωt)`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n**5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe expectation value of `S_z` oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. The question asks for the oscillation frequency. Given the options, it is clear that it refers to this angular frequency.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The initial state must be correctly identified as the lowest energy state, `|+z⟩`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y` correctly describes the system for `t > 0`.\n    *   The spin commutation relations (`[S_i, S_j] = iħε_ijk S_k`) are crucial for the calculation.\n    *   The final equation of motion for `⟨S_z⟩` is that of a simple harmonic oscillator, from which the frequency can be directly identified. The phenomenon is known as Larmor Precession, and `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
