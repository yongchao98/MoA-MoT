    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a particle decay at rest. The two fundamental principles we need to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the speeds involved are likely to be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n*   **Initial State:** The pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary (at rest).\n*   **Rest Mass of Pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$):** 139.6 MeV\n*   **Rest Mass of Muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$):** 105.7 MeV\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless. This is a standard and safe assumption for this type of problem. For a massless particle, its rest mass is zero ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$) and its total energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light ($E_{\\nu} = pc$).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum of the system is zero because the pion is at rest ($p_{initial} = 0$).\n*   After the decay, two particles are produced: the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$). Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   According to the conservation of momentum:\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n*   **Careful Point:** This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum. Let's call this magnitude $p$.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**Step B: Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   The final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   Energy of muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n    *   Energy of neutrino (massless): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2} = p_{\\nu}c = pc$\n*   According to the conservation of energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $139.6 \\text{ MeV} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2} + pc$\n\n**Step C: Solve for the Momentum (p)**\n\nNow we solve the energy equation for the unknown momentum magnitude, $p$.\n\n1.  Isolate the square root term:\n    $139.6 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $(139.6 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2$\n3.  Expand the left side:\n    $(139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2$\n4.  The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n    $(139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)(pc) = (105.7)^2$\n5.  Rearrange to solve for $pc$:\n    $(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 2(139.6)(pc)$\n    $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n6.  Calculate the numerical value:\n    $pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2}$\n    $pc \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\n**Step D: Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy ($KE = E - mc^2$).\n\n1.  **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   Since the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero. Its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n\n2.  **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    *   We can find the muon's total energy ($E_{\\mu}$) first using energy conservation:\n        $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 109.82$ MeV\n    *   Now, calculate the muon's kinetic energy:\n        $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 109.82 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = 4.12$ MeV\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$): **29.8 MeV**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
