    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. We use the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract the quantum numbers:\n*   **Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (spin singlet).\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript `0` gives `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Final State and Emitted Particle\n\nThe final state consists of a new two-nucleon state (NN_f) and an emitted particle X.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN center of mass is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letters (`s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `f` for `l_X=3`).\n    *   We assume particle X has zero spin (`S_X=0`), as is typical for such problems (e.g., pion emission).\n*   **Final NN State (NN_f):**\n    *   It has an isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its quantum numbers (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) are given by the term symbols in each option.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must obey several fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final system.\n    `J_initial = J_final_system`\n    The final system's angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN_f angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X = l_X + S_X`).\n    With `J_i = 0` and assuming `S_X = 0`, the conservation law is `0 = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    The total parity must be conserved.\n    `P_i = P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_relative`\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_relative = (-1)^l_X` (parity from the relative motion of X)\n    Substituting the known values:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`\n    This requires the sum `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for Final NN State:**\n    The problem provides the specific constraint for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. The transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can only be `S=0` (antiparallel spins) or `S=1` (parallel spins). A spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon state. Therefore, this final state cannot exist, and the transition is not permitted. For completeness, let's check the other rules.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted, because the final NN state `7D1` is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **No, 2 is even.** (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   C is not permitted because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   D is not permitted because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nThe question explicitly directs us to use the Pauli statistics requirement. Applying the three main selection rules (J-conservation, P-conservation, and the given Pauli rule), option D is the one that fails. While option C is also impossible, the reason for its failure is the composition of the state itself, whereas the failure in D is a direct violation of one of the transition rules we were asked to check. In the context of such questions, we test the given rules. The rule explicitly given for the final state's quantum numbers is violated by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
