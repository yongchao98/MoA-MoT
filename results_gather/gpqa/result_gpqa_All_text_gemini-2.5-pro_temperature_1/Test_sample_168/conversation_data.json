    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V)\n\n1.  **Identify the Final State:** The decay produces six particles in the final state: two heavy nucleons (B), two light particles (E), and two other light particles (V).\n2.  **Determine the Spectrum Shape:** When a decay results in three or more final particles, the total energy released (the Q-value) can be distributed among them in a continuous range of possibilities, while still conserving total energy and momentum. The energy of any specific subset of particles (like the two E particles) is not fixed but can vary. This is why the problem states the energy spectrum of the E particles is **continuous**.\n3.  **Analyze the Endpoint (Q):** The total energy released by the conversion of the heavy nucleons is `ΔE = (2 * m_A - 2 * m_B) * c²`. This energy is distributed among the kinetic energies and rest masses of the created particles (2E and 2V), plus the small recoil kinetic energy of the 2B nuclei (which we can neglect for this comparison).\n    The total energy of the two E particles is `E_2E`. The total energy of the two V particles is `E_2V`.\n    Energy conservation dictates: `ΔE ≈ E_2E + E_2V`.\n    The endpoint of the E spectrum (`Q`) is the maximum possible value for `E_2E`. This occurs when the other light particles (the two V's) carry away the minimum possible energy.\n    A particle with mass `m` has a minimum energy equal to its rest energy, `mc²`. Since particle V has mass (`m_V > 0`), the minimum energy carried away by the two V particles is their combined rest energy: `E_2V_min = 2 * m_V * c²`.\n    Therefore, the endpoint of the original spectrum is: `Q = E_2E_max ≈ ΔE - 2 * m_V * c²`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Variant Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M)\n\n1.  **Identify the Final State:** The variant decay produces five particles in the final state: two heavy nucleons (B), two light particles (E), and one exotic massless particle (M).\n2.  **Determine the Spectrum Shape:** Since the final state still consists of more than two particles (five in this case), the energy distribution remains governed by the same principles. The energy will be shared continuously among the products. Therefore, the spectrum of the E particles will **remain continuous**. This eliminates options A and B. The change in the number and nature of the final particles will alter the statistical probabilities, leading to an \"adjusted shape\" of the spectrum.\n3.  **Analyze the New Endpoint (Q'):** The total energy released from the heavy nucleons is the same as before: `ΔE = (2 * m_A - 2 * m_B) * c²`.\n    This energy is now distributed as: `ΔE ≈ E_2E + E_M`.\n    The new endpoint (`Q'`) is the maximum energy for the E particles, which occurs when the particle M carries away the minimum possible energy.\n    The particle M is **massless** (`m_M = 0`). The minimum energy for a massless particle is zero. `E_M_min = 0`.\n    Therefore, the endpoint of the new spectrum is: `Q' = E_2E_max ≈ ΔE - 0 = ΔE`.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Endpoints\n\n*   Original Endpoint: `Q ≈ ΔE - 2 * m_V * c²`\n*   New Endpoint: `Q' ≈ ΔE`\n\nSince V is a particle (even if \"light\"), it has a non-zero mass, so `2 * m_V * c² > 0`.\nBy comparing the two expressions, we can see that `Q' > Q`. The new endpoint is greater than the original endpoint by the amount of the rest energy of the two V particles that are no longer emitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The spectrum remains **continuous** because the decay is still a multi-body process.\n*   The endpoint **increases** because the massless particle M can carry away zero energy, whereas the two massive V particles must carry away at least their combined rest energy (`2 * m_V * c²`).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
