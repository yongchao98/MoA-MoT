    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe most crucial information for distinguishing between the isomers lies in the proton NMR splitting patterns. We are given two specific, complex splitting patterns for two different protons in the molecule.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n\nOur task is to find the single structure among the options that contains protons matching both of these complex splitting patterns. We will analyze the methine protons (CH groups) on the main carbon chain, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's draw each structure and analyze the expected splitting for its key protons. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(CH3)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-2 (2 protons, triplet), H-4 (1 proton, doublet), and the C3-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet) and the two methyl groups attached to it (6 protons total, likely a septet). This would be a doublet of septets.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(2)(CH3)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-2 (1 proton, doublet), H-4 (2 protons, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C2 (H-2):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet) and the C2-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 3,4-Diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH3(6)-CH2(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet), H-5 (2 protons, triplet), and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-4 (1 proton, doublet) and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet). This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nLet's analyze the two key methine protons, H-3 and H-4.\n\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH3 group at C5 (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group at C2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) -> gives another **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is the only candidate that contains a proton (H-4) that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton (H-3) that produces a `dtt` signal.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe FTIR data confirms a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR splitting patterns are the deciding factor. Only structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has two different methine protons whose neighboring environments perfectly match the requirements to produce one `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and one `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
