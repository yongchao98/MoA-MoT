    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Absorption:** Neutral hydrogen atoms absorb photons that can excite their electron from the ground state (n=1) to the first excited state (n=2). This specific transition corresponds to a photon with a wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) in the rest frame of the hydrogen atom. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Cosmological Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects gets \"stretched\" to longer wavelengths as it travels towards us. The redshift, 'z', quantifies this stretching. The relationship between the wavelength emitted or absorbed by the object (rest wavelength, λ_rest) and the wavelength we observe on Earth (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\n        `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n    *   **Ground-Based Optical Telescopes:** This is the key constraint. Telescopes on the ground must look through Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is not transparent to all wavelengths. Specifically, ozone (O3) and other molecules in the upper atmosphere absorb most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation.\n\n2.  **Determine the Observational Constraint:**\n    *   The Lyman-alpha line has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of 1216 Å, which is deep in the UV.\n    *   Earth's atmosphere is opaque to these UV wavelengths.\n    *   For the absorption line to be detected by a ground-based telescope, it must be redshifted to a wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere. This is known as the \"atmospheric window\".\n    *   The atmospheric cutoff in the blue/UV end of the spectrum is not perfectly sharp, but a reasonable and commonly used estimate for the shortest wavelength that can be effectively observed from a good ground site is around 3500 Å (or 350 nm). We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift, so we need to find the minimum redshift that shifts the 1216 Å line to this minimum observable wavelength.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   We want to find the minimum redshift, `z_min`, that makes the Lyman-alpha line observable. This occurs when the observed wavelength is equal to the minimum wavelength allowed by the atmosphere.\n    *   Using the redshift formula: `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n    *   Set the known values:\n        *   `λ_rest` = 1216 Å\n        *   `λ_observed` (minimum) ≈ 3500 Å\n    *   Now, we set up the equation to solve for `z_min`:\n        `3500 Å = 1216 Å * (1 + z_min)`\n    *   Solve for `(1 + z_min)`:\n        `(1 + z_min) = 3500 / 1216 ≈ 2.878`\n    *   Solve for `z_min`:\n        `z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n        `z_min ≈ 1.878`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated lower limit for the redshift is approximately 1.88.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) 2.4\n        *   B) 1.9\n        *   C) 1.2\n        *   D) 3\n    *   Our calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to the value of 1.9 provided in option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   The exact atmospheric cutoff wavelength can vary slightly depending on the observatory's altitude and atmospheric conditions, but ~3500 Å is a standard estimate for this type of problem.\n*   The question asks for a *lower limit*. A redshift higher than this value (e.g., z=2.4 or z=3) would shift the Lyman-alpha line even further into the visible spectrum (to 4134 Å and 4864 Å, respectively), making it easily detectable. However, z=1.9 is the approximate *minimum* redshift required for the line to even appear in the observable range of a ground-based telescope.\n*   A redshift of z=1.2 would shift the line to only 2675 Å, which is still well within the UV range blocked by the atmosphere.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nTo be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope, the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than the atmospheric UV cutoff (~3500 Å). The minimum redshift that achieves this is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
