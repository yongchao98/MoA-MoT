    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalent.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 indicates a high degree of unsaturation. This is very characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE). The additional unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) suggested by the IR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. A conjugated ketone would also be in this region, but an ester is more likely given the other data. It is generally too high for a simple amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic proton region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The large separation in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) means one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the adjacent protons and shifts them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The other is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its adjacent protons and shifts them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   This signal represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This signal represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   The quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH3 group).\n    *   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) for the -CH2- group is characteristic of it being attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group, which confirms the IR data.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an EDG. The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG.\n4.  Attaching these groups to the para positions of the benzene ring gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n5.  This structure is fully consistent with all spectral data. The -NH2 group makes the ortho protons appear upfield at 7.0 ppm, and the -COOEt group makes its ortho protons appear downfield at 8.0 ppm. The ethyl group and amine protons are also perfectly accounted for.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester of a phenol. The NMR would show a quartet for a -CH2- group next to a carbonyl, which would be much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and a 1H signal for the amide proton in the NMR. It lacks the 2H signal for a primary amine.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
