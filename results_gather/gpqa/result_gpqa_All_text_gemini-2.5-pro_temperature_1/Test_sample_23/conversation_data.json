    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen (%H) is given by the formula: %H = (Total mass of H atoms / Molar mass of hydrocarbon) * 100.\n14.28% is very close to 1/7, which is approximately 14.2857%.\nLet the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n%H = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) ≈ y / (12x + y).\nIf y / (12x + y) = 1/7, then 7y = 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\nSo, the empirical formula of Z is (CH2). The general formula is CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them C and D.\nMixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are saturated (contain no C=C or C≡C bonds).\nOne component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z. So, let C = Z = CnH2n (a cycloalkane).\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial as C=Z), and hydrogenation of D also gives Z.\nSo, D must be a compound that can be converted to Z by adding hydrogen. However, Y (and thus D) is stated to be saturated. This seems like a contradiction.\nLet's reconsider the meaning of \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this test is primarily for alkenes/alkynes, aromatic compounds like benzene also do not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Let's hypothesize that one component of Y is aromatic.\nLet's assume D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The general formula for a simple mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbon is CnH2n-6 (e.g., benzene C6H6, where n=6, 2n-6 = 12-6 = 6).\nHydrogenation of an aromatic ring (like D) under severe conditions yields the corresponding cycloalkane (Z). For example, C6H6 (benzene) + 3H2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane). This fits the description perfectly.\nSo, Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon D (CnH2n-6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of mixture X and the reaction.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\nX decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\nHydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z. This implies that both A and B have the same n-carbon skeleton as Z, and both are converted to Z upon complete hydrogenation.\nThe reaction is the disproportionation of mixture X to form mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the simplest stoichiometry is A + B → C + D.\nSubstituting the formulas we deduced:\nA(CnHx) + B(CnH_y) → Z(CnH2n) + D(CnH2n-6)\n\n**Step 4: Perform a hydrogen atom balance and solve for n.**\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved in the reaction. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\nNumber of H in reactants = Number of H in products\nx + y = (2n) + (2n - 6)\nx + y = 4n - 6\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is exactly x + y.\nSo, Total H atoms = 4n - 6.\n\nWe need to find the value of n. We know that Z (CnH2n) is a widely used solvent. The most common examples are cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7). Let's test these values.\nIf n = 6:\n*   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). D = Benzene (C6H6). Both are liquids and widely used.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be x + y = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n*   This corresponds to option D.\n*   Let's check if we can find suitable compounds A and B for mixture X. A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane and are not conjugated. For x+y=18, we can choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both fit the criteria. `10 + 8 = 18`.\n\nIf n = 7:\n*   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). D = Toluene (C7H8). Both are liquids and widely used.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be x + y = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n*   Let's check for A and B. We need non-conjugated unsaturated C7 hydrocarbons. For x+y=22, we could choose A = a methylcyclohexene isomer (C7H12) and B = a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene isomer (C7H10). This is also a plausible scenario. `12 + 10 = 22`.\n\nWe have two plausible solutions corresponding to two different options (18 and 22). However, such problems in chemistry contests usually have a unique intended answer. The disproportionation of C6 hydroaromatics to cyclohexane and benzene is a classic, archetypal reaction in catalysis. It is the simplest and most fundamental example that fits the problem's constraints. Therefore, it is most likely the intended scenario.\n\nAssuming n=6 is the intended case:\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is x + y = 18.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Identify Z as a cycloalkane CnH2n.\n*   Identify Y as {CnH2n, CnH2n-6} (a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound).\n*   Identify X as {CnHx, CnH_y} (two unsaturated precursors).\n*   Balance the reaction A + B -> Z + D to get x + y = 4n - 6.\n*   Based on common examples and the options, deduce n=6.\n*   Calculate the total hydrogen atoms: x + y = 4(6) - 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
