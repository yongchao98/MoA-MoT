    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of the observer. We want to find the speed of light in this frame. Let's denote this speed by *u*.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S):** The glass is moving at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame S' with respect to frame S is *v*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the moving frame (S'):** In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, *n*. The speed of light in a medium is given by *c/n*. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum *c=1*, the speed of the light beam as measured in the glass frame (S') is *u' = 1/n*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the laboratory frame (S):** This is the unknown quantity we need to find, which we have denoted as *u*.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    In classical physics (Galilean relativity), we would simply add the velocities: *u = u' + v = 1/n + v*. However, for speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's theory of special relativity. The correct formula is the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)*\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   *u'* = 1/n (speed of light in the glass's rest frame)\n    *   *v* = v (speed of the glass relative to the lab)\n    *   *c* = 1 (speed of light in vacuum)\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )*\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )*\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by *n*. Let's use the latter method as it's more direct.\n\n    *u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * ( 1 + v/n ) )*\n\n    Distribute *n* in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v\n    *   Denominator: n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v\n\n    So, the simplified expression for *u* is:\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativity is Key:** The problem involves speeds that can be a significant fraction of the speed of light (since light is involved), so relativistic effects cannot be ignored. Using the Galilean addition *u = u' + v* would be incorrect.\n*   **Speed of Light in a Medium:** A common mistake is to assume the speed of light is always *c* (or 1 in this case). The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light *in a vacuum* is *c* for all inertial observers. The speed of light *in a medium* is *c/n* only in the rest frame of that medium.\n*   **Frame Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify which velocity belongs to which frame of reference. *u'* is the speed in the moving frame (S'), and *u* is the speed in the stationary lab frame (S).\n*   **Direction of Motion:** The problem states that the glass and the light beam move in the *same direction*. This is why we use the '+' sign in the numerator of the velocity addition formula, *(u' + v)*. If they were in opposite directions, we would use a '-' sign.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n1.  Speed of light in the rest frame of the glass: *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n2.  Speed of the glass in the lab frame: *v*.\n3.  Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)*.\n4.  Substitute values: *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v)*.\n5.  Simplify by multiplying numerator and denominator by *n*: *u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)*.\n6.  This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
