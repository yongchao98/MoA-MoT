    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$). This means we need to calculate the ratio $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** For a star radiating as a black body, the luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $R$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $T$ is the star's surface temperature.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Form the Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio $L_1 / L_2$, we can write the luminosity for each star and divide:\n    $L_1 = 4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n    Dividing the first equation by the second, the constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) * (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2 \\implies R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n    Substituting this into our ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio ($T_1 / T_2$), we must use the information about the wavelength of peak brightness.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max,0}$, the rest-frame wavelength). The law is $T = b / \\lambda_{max,0}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states the \"wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest\". This refers to the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda'_{max}$), not the wavelength emitted in the star's own reference frame. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$).\n    The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is: $\\lambda'_{max} = \\lambda_{max,0} (1 + v_r / c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Apply the Laws to Both Stars:**\n    *   **For Star_1:**\n        *   Radial velocity $v_{r,1} = 0$.\n        *   Therefore, there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda'_{max,1} = \\lambda_{max,0,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{max,0,1}$.\n        *   From Wien's Law: $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max,0,1}$.\n    *   **For Star_2:**\n        *   Radial velocity $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s = $7 \\times 10^5$ m/s.\n        *   The observed wavelength is shifted: $\\lambda'_{max,2} = \\lambda_{max,0,2}(1 + v_{r,2} / c)$.\n        *   From Wien's Law: $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max,0,2}$.\n\n7.  **Connect the Temperatures:** We are told that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda'_{max,1} = \\lambda'_{max,2}$.\n    *   Substituting the expressions from step 6:\n        $\\lambda_{max,0,1} = \\lambda_{max,0,2}(1 + v_{r,2} / c)$\n    *   Now, we can express the wavelengths in terms of temperatures using Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{max,0} = b/T$):\n        $b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$\n    *   The constant $b$ cancels out:\n        $1 / T_1 = (1 / T_2) * (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$\n    *   Rearranging to find the temperature ratio $T_1 / T_2$:\n        $T_2 / T_1 = 1 + v_{r,2} / c \\implies T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   First, calculate the term $v_{r,2} / c$. The speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n        $v_{r,2} / c = (7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}) / (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) = (7/3) \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.002333$\n    *   Now, calculate the temperature ratio:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) = 1 / 1.002333$\n    *   Finally, substitute this back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.002333)^4 = 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    *   Calculate the denominator: $(1.002333)^4 \\approx 1.00936$\n    *   Calculate the final ratio: $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / 1.00936 \\approx 2.229$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately 2.229. This value matches option B. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\nFinal Answer is ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
