    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part 1: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Tautomerism**\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and the shifting of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³ hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    HC==CH\n     |  |\n    O=C--C=O\n     |  |\n    HC==CH\n    ```\n    A more accurate representation:\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    C\n   / \\\\\n  HC  CH\n  ||  ||\n  HC  CH\n   \\ //\n    C\n   \\\\\n    O\n    ```\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are called alpha-carbons. In benzoquinone, all four carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized. There are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with attached hydrogens.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    ```\n         O\n        //\n      C\n     /  \\\n   H₂C    CH₂\n    |      |\n  O=C      C=O\n     \\    /\n       CH₂\n    ```\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each is an sp³ hybridized carbon bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily tautomerize. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *Keto form (less stable)* <=> *Enol form (phloroglucinol, aromatic, more stable)*\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n**Summary for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    CH₃ - C*H - C - O - CH₃\n          |\n          OH\n    ```\n*   **Check for Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom labeled with an asterisk (C2).\n    *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n    *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl group)\n    *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it contains a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    ```\n         H         COOCH₃\n          \\       /\n           C === C\n          /       \\\n    CH₃OOC         H\n    ```\n*   **Check for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
