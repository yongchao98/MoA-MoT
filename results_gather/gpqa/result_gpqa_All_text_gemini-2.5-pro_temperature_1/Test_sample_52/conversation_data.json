    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the problem statement.**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means it is a benzene ring with two substituents (R1 and R2). The base formula for this core is C6H4.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group is present. This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. If they give only two signals, it implies symmetry. A 1,4- (para) substitution pattern results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). This is the most likely substitution pattern.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with protons attached. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**. This proton is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, causing the quartet split).\n        *   This specific pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the central carbon is split by the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons (dq), while the terminal vinyl proton is split only by the central vinyl proton (d). This substituent has the formula -C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl substituent identified above.\n        *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any methylene (-CH2-) groups in the molecule. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), propyl ester, etc.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Core):** A para-disubstituted benzene ring, **-C6H4-**.\n*   **Fragment 2 (Substituent 1):** A propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. Its formula is **-C3H5**.\n*   **Fragment 3 (Substituent 2):** An ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**.\n    *   An acetate group: **-O-CO-CH3**.\n    *   In either case, this fragment contributes two oxygen atoms, two carbon atoms, and three hydrogen atoms. The formula contribution is **-C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total molecular formula.**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to get the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the result with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).**\n\nThe DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Formula-based DoU:** For C11H12O2, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **Structure-based DoU:** The deduced structure has:\n    *   A benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   A vinyl C=C double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An ester C=O double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\nThe DoU from the formula matches the DoU from the structure, confirming the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (Incorrect, implies fewer double bonds/rings)\n*   B) C12H14O2 (Incorrect formula and would require a -CH2- group, which is absent)\n*   C) C12H12O2 (Incorrect, has a different C count and would require an additional degree of unsaturation)\n*   D) C11H12O2 (Correct)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
