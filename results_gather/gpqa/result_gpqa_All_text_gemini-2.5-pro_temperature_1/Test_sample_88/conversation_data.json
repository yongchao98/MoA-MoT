    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step reaction to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a rigid, cage-like hydrocarbon.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration (2+10+2=14H) matches the number of protons in the starting material, so the molecular formula of Product 1 is C10H14O.\n*   **Interpretation:** The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) on the rigid cage structure suggest a complex rearrangement is likely. The identity of Product 1 is not immediately obvious from standard reaction mechanisms and its spectral data does not match simple, unrearranged products. However, the subsequent reaction steps will provide crucial clues about its structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces a ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol (Product 2).\n*   **Product 2:** An alcohol with the formula C10H16O (C10H14O + 2H). The rest of the molecular structure of Product 1 remains unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3 and its structure**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The fact that this reaction occurs proves that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**.\n*   **Deduction:** Since the MPV reduction only affects the C=O group, **Product 1 must also have contained a C=C double bond**. Therefore, Product 1 was an unsaturated ketone. The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) in Product 1 can now be confidently assigned to two vinyl protons. The fact that these two vinyl protons are equivalent implies that the molecule has an element of symmetry (a plane or C₂ axis) with respect to the double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C bond in Product 2, forming two carbonyl groups. Since the vinyl protons in Product 1 (and thus Product 2) were of the type -CH=CH-, the ozonolysis will create two aldehyde groups (-CHO). Since the C=C bond must have been in a ring to keep the molecule together, Product 3 is a single molecule containing two aldehyde groups and the original alcohol group. Its formula is C10H16O3.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the most deshielded proton in Product 3 and its coupling pattern**\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the possible non-exchangeable protons are aliphatic (C-H), protons alpha to carbonyls or the alcohol, and aldehyde protons (-CHO). Aldehyde protons are significantly deshielded and appear at δ = 9-10 ppm, making them the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in the molecule.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of the Aldehyde Proton:** The splitting pattern of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) depends on the number of protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). Let's denote the structure as Cβ-Cα-CHO.\n    *   The primary coupling is with the proton(s) on Cα.\n    *   In rigid polycyclic systems like those derived from adamantane, significant long-range coupling (4-bond coupling) to protons on Cβ is common and must be considered.\n*   **Analyzing the options:** The complex splitting patterns offered as choices (e.g., triplet of triplets) strongly suggest that such long-range coupling is occurring.\n    *   A **triplet** arises from coupling to two equivalent protons (e.g., a CH₂ group).\n    *   A **triplet of triplets** arises from coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons. For the aldehyde proton, this would mean coupling to two protons on Cα (giving a triplet) and also coupling to two protons on Cβ (giving another triplet).\n*   **Putting it all together:** For the aldehyde proton signal to be a triplet of triplets, the structural fragment in Product 3 must be **-CH₂-CH₂-CHO**. This fragment must have originated from a **-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-** fragment in Product 2.\n*   **Plausibility:** While adamantane itself does not contain a -CH₂-CH₂- unit, its known rearrangement products, such as those with a twistane skeleton, do contain this unit. A plausible (though non-trivial) rearrangement pathway from 1,3-dibromoadamantane can lead to a precursor (Product 2) with a twistane-like framework containing a symmetric C=C bond and the required -CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH- fragment. The rigidity of this framework would facilitate the 4-bond coupling necessary for the triplet of triplets pattern. Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the provided information and options is that the aldehyde proton is coupled to both an α-CH₂ group and a β-CH₂ group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1.  The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 is the aldehyde proton.\n2.  Its coupling pattern is determined by the protons on the α and β carbons.\n3.  The \"triplet of triplets\" option requires coupling to two α-protons and two β-protons.\n4.  This implies the structure in Product 3 is -CH₂-CH₂-CHO, which is a plausible outcome from the ozonolysis of a rearranged adamantane derivative.\n\nThe coupling pattern is a triplet (from the two α-protons) of triplets (from the two β-protons).\n\n<<<A>>>"
