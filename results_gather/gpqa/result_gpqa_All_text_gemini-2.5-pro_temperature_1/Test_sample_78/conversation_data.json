    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the product from the given NMR data.**\n\nThe product results from an isomerization of Compound X (C11H12O), so the product also has the formula C11H12O.\nThe degree of unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 13C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), likely a ketone due to the high chemical shift. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Signals at δ 21.3 ppm and δ 28.4 ppm are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two methyl groups (-CH3). The shift at δ ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene), and the shift at δ ~28 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a ketone (an acetyl group).\n    *   The remaining 8 carbon signals are in the δ 126-145 ppm range, which is the region for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons. A benzene ring accounts for four degrees of unsaturation, and a C=C double bond accounts for one.\n    *   Total DBE accounted for: 1 (C=O) + 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C) = 6. This matches the calculated DBE.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This supports the assignment of one methyl group on an aromatic ring and one as part of an acetyl group.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 6.75-7.71) total 6 protons (1H+2H+1H+2H).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71), is a classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining two signals, a doublet at δ 6.75 (1H) and a doublet at δ 7.68 (1H), are characteristic of two protons on a C=C double bond, coupled only to each other. The large difference in chemical shifts suggests a conjugated system, likely an α,β-unsaturated ketone. A *trans* configuration is most likely for stability and for the observed large coupling constants that would result in clean doublets.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure of the Product:**\n    Based on the analysis, the product contains the following fragments:\n    1.  An acetyl group (CH3-C=O)\n    2.  A *para*-substituted benzene ring, with one substituent being a methyl group (forming a *p*-tolyl group).\n    3.  A trans -CH=CH- double bond linking the carbonyl carbon and the *p*-tolyl group.\n\n    The only structure that fits all this evidence is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    Let's verify its formula: C11H12O. This matches. The structure is consistent with all NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X based on the reaction.**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to the product identified in Step 1. This means Compound X must be an isomer of (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one and have the same core carbon skeleton where possible.\n\nThe product has a *p*-tolyl group (a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position). Since the reaction is an isomerization, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain this *p*-tolyl group.\n\nLet's examine the given options for Compound X:\n*   A) 2-styrylepoxide: Contains a phenyl group (-C6H5), not a *p*-tolyl group. Also has the wrong formula (C10H10O).\n*   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a phenyl group (-C6H5), not a *p*-tolyl group.\n*   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is -CH=CH-C6H4-CH3, which contains a *p*-tolyl group. The formula is C11H12O. This is a plausible candidate.\n*   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group (-C6H5), not a *p*-tolyl group.\n\nOnly **Compound C** possesses the necessary *p*-tolyl structural unit to form the product upon isomerization.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the chemical transformation.**\n\nThe proposed reaction is the isomerization of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This transformation of an α,β-unsaturated terminal epoxide into a conjugated methyl ketone is a known reaction, especially under basic conditions (like DABCO) at high temperatures. The reaction proceeds through a common dienolate intermediate, which then rearranges to the thermodynamically most stable conjugated ketone product. The structure of Compound X is therefore consistent with the given starting material options and the reaction product.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Correctly deduce the product structure from the detailed NMR data. The proton NMR pattern of two 2H doublets and two 1H doublets is a key clue to the presence of both a p-disubstituted ring and a disubstituted alkene.\n2.  Recognize that the 13C signal at δ ~198 ppm is definitive for a ketone/aldehyde, and the 1H NMR (absence of a signal at δ 9-10 ppm) confirms it is a ketone.\n3.  Understand that an isomerization reaction preserves the atoms and fundamental structural elements (like a substituted aromatic ring) that are not involved in the rearrangement.\n4.  Match the required structural element (p-tolyl group) from the product to the options for the starting material.\n5.  Recognize the plausibility of the epoxide-to-ketone rearrangement under the given conditions.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
