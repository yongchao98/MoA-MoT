    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Experimental Design**\nThe main objective is to express a recombinant protein in a mouse model. This protein is the mouse GADD45G protein, modified to have an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N-terminus. The purpose of the HA tag is to allow for easy purification (affinity purification) and detection of the protein. The expression system is first tested in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The problem is that the protein is not being expressed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Provided Information**\nWe are given the DNA sequence of the plus strand (the coding strand) of the engineered construct. This is the most crucial piece of evidence. The sequence is:\n`5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'`\n\n**Step 3: Dissect the DNA Sequence**\nSince the protein is designed to have an N-terminal tag, we should look at the beginning of the sequence. Translation in eukaryotes almost always starts with an `ATG` codon, which codes for Methionine.\n\n*   The sequence starts with `ATG`. This is the start codon.\n*   The HA tag's amino acid sequence is `YPYDVPDYA`. Let's see if the DNA sequence codes for this. We will read the DNA in triplets (codons) after the initial `ATG`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M) - The start codon.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    So far, the sequence `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for `M-YPYDVPDYA`, which is the start methionine followed by the HA tag.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Critical Error**\nLet's continue reading the sequence immediately after the HA tag coding region.\n*   The sequence continues: `...GCC AAA TGA...`\n*   `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n*   The next codon is `TGA`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Function of the `TGA` Codon**\nIn the genetic code, there are three specific codons that do not code for an amino acid but instead signal the ribosome to stop translation. These are the \"stop codons\".\n*   `UAA` (in mRNA) corresponds to `TAA` (in DNA)\n*   `UAG` (in mRNA) corresponds to `TAG` (in DNA)\n*   `UGA` (in mRNA) corresponds to `TGA` (in DNA)\nThe `TGA` codon in the DNA sequence is a premature stop codon.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Consequence of the Error**\nWhen the cellular machinery transcribes this DNA into mRNA, the mRNA will have a `UGA` stop codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single Lysine. When the ribosome translates this mRNA, it will start at the `AUG` codon, synthesize the short peptide `M-YPYDVPDYA-K`, and then encounter the `UGA` stop codon. At this point, the ribosome will release the mRNA and the very short, incomplete peptide, thus terminating translation. The intended full-length GADD45G protein will never be made.\n\n**Step 7: Evaluate the Given Options**\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. Stop codons are recognized by protein \"release factors,\" not tRNAs. Furthermore, the problematic codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. A missense mutation would change one amino acid to another. Our analysis shows that the HA tag sequence (`YPYDVPDYA`) is coded correctly. The mutation is a *nonsense* mutation (introduction of a premature stop codon), not a missense mutation.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While the lack of a linker can sometimes cause protein misfolding and subsequent degradation (proteolysis), it is not the primary issue here. The primary problem is that the full-length protein is not even being synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon. This is a failure of translation, not a post-translational problem.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon causes translation to halt long before the ribosome can translate the coding sequence for the GADD45G protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
