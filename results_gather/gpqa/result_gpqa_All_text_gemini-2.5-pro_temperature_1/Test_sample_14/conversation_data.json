    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better target for observation. We need to calculate the ratio of their probabilities.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Core Formula\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula:\n*   P_transit ≈ R_star / a\n    *   Where `R_star` is the radius of the host star.\n    *   And `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   This formula assumes a random orbital inclination, which is a standard assumption for this type of problem.\n\n### Step 3: List the Given Information and Define Variables\nLet's denote the properties of Planet_1 and its host star with a subscript '1', and those for Planet_2 with a subscript '2'.\n\n*   **Planets:**\n    *   Masses: M_p1 = M_p2 (This information is not directly needed for the probability calculation but confirms they are similar planets).\n    *   Orbital Periods: P_orb1 = P_orb2 / 3\n    *   Orbits: Both are circular, which means the orbital distance is always equal to the semi-major axis, `a`.\n\n*   **Host Stars:**\n    *   Masses: M_star1 = 2 * M_star2\n    *   Radii: R_star1 = R_star2\n\n### Step 4: Relate Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the orbital period (`P_orb`) and the host star's mass (`M_star`) using Kepler's Third Law:\n*   P_orb² ∝ a³ / M_star\n\nTo find `a`, we can rearrange this relationship:\n*   a³ ∝ P_orb² * M_star\n*   a ∝ (P_orb² * M_star)^(1/3)\n\n**Careful Point:** This relationship is crucial. The semi-major axis depends on both the orbital period and the mass of the star being orbited. A common mistake is to assume `a` only depends on the period.\n\n### Step 5: Set up the Ratio of Transit Probabilities\nWe want to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (P_transit1 / P_transit2).\n\n*   P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_star1 / a1) / (R_star2 / a2)\n*   Rearranging this gives: P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_star1 / R_star2) * (a2 / a1)\n\n### Step 6: Substitute Known Values into the Ratio\n1.  **Star Radii:** We are given that R_star1 = R_star2. Therefore, the term (R_star1 / R_star2) = 1.\n    *   The probability ratio simplifies to: **P_transit1 / P_transit2 = a2 / a1**\n\n    **Careful Point:** Notice the inversion of indices. The probability ratio `1/2` is equal to the semi-major axis ratio `2/1` because probability is *inversely* proportional to the semi-major axis.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axes:** Now we need to calculate the ratio a2 / a1 using the relationship from Kepler's Law.\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (P_orb2² * M_star2) / (P_orb1² * M_star1) ]^(1/3)\n\n3.  **Substitute the relationships for Period and Stellar Mass:**\n    *   We know M_star1 = 2 * M_star2.\n    *   We know P_orb1 = P_orb2 / 3.\n    *   Let's substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\n        *   a2 / a1 = [ (P_orb2² * M_star2) / ( (P_orb2 / 3)² * (2 * M_star2) ) ]^(1/3)\n\n### Step 7: Simplify and Calculate the Final Ratio\nLet's simplify the expression inside the cube root:\n\n1.  Square the term for Planet_1's period: (P_orb2 / 3)² = P_orb2² / 9.\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (P_orb2² * M_star2) / ( (P_orb2² / 9) * (2 * M_star2) ) ]^(1/3)\n\n2.  Combine the terms in the denominator:\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (P_orb2² * M_star2) / ( (2/9) * P_orb2² * M_star2 ) ]^(1/3)\n\n3.  Cancel out the common terms (P_orb2² and M_star2) from the numerator and denominator.\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3)\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ 9 / 2 ]^(1/3)\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ 4.5 ]^(1/3)\n\n4.  Calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n    *   We know 1³ = 1 and 2³ = 8. The value will be between 1 and 2.\n    *   (1.65)³ = 1.65 * 1.65 * 1.65 ≈ 4.49\n    *   So, a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65.\n\n### Step 8: Final Conclusion\nSince P_transit1 / P_transit2 = a2 / a1, we have:\n*   P_transit1 / P_transit2 ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately **1.65 times higher** than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
