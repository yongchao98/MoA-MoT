    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Chemical System**\nThe problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA (Ca-EDTA). We are given the initial stoichiometric concentration of this complex and its formation constant (K_f). We need to find the equilibrium concentration of the free calcium ions (Ca^2+). A high formation constant indicates that the complex is very stable and does not dissociate much. However, a small amount will dissociate to establish an equilibrium.\n\n**Step 2: Write the Relevant Chemical Equation**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\nCa^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA^2-\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the dissociated ions, it's more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\nCa-EDTA^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n**Step 3: Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Ca-EDTA^2-    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA^4-       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**Careful Point:** We assume that initially, there are no free Ca^2+ or EDTA^4- ions, only the complex. The stoichiometry is 1:1:1, so if 'x' moles/L of the complex dissociate, 'x' moles/L of Ca^2+ and 'x' moles/L of EDTA^4- are formed.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression**\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant (K_f) expression:\n\nK_f = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-])\n5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n**Step 5: Simplify and Solve for x**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10 >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n\n**Careful Point:** This assumption allows us to simplify the calculation. We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. We should always verify this assumption after finding 'x'.\n\nThe simplified equation is:\n5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\nx^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-2) / (5 x 10^10)\nx^2 ≈ 0.4 x 10^-12\nx^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\nTo find x, we take the square root:\nx = √(4 x 10^-13)\nx = √(40 x 10^-14)  *(This manipulation makes the exponent even and easier to root)*\nx = (√40) x 10^-7\nSince √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer and Verification**\nThe value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n[Ca^2+] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M\n\nLet's check our assumption: Is x (6.3 x 10^-7) much smaller than 0.02? Yes, it is several orders of magnitude smaller, so our simplification was valid.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 1.0x10^-2 M\nC) 2.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
