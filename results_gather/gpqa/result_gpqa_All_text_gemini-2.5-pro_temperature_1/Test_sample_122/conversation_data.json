    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial reference frames: the frame of the Galaxy (let's call it S) and the frame of the supernova ejecta (let's call it S').\n    *   The problem states that from the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. By the principle of relativity, this also means the ejecta is moving at the same speed `v` relative to the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   A time interval of `Δt' = 50 s` passes in the ejecta's reference frame (S').\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine if Relativistic Effects are Significant:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   We compare this to the speed of light `c`. The ratio is `β = v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n    *   Since this velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), we must use the principles of special relativity. A classical calculation would be incorrect.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Relativistic Concept:**\n    *   We are given a time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta, S') and asked to find a distance traveled in the stationary frame (the Galaxy, S).\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   The time interval `Δt' = 50 s` is measured by a clock moving with the ejecta. This is known as the *proper time*.\n    *   Due to *time dilation*, an observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` for the same event.\n    *   The relationship between the time `Δt` in the stationary frame and the proper time `Δt'` in the moving frame is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   We already found `β = v/c = 0.2`.\n    *   `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   Calculating the value: `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`.\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n    *   This shows that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity (measured in the Galaxy frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also measured in the Galaxy frame).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s) * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The key is to correctly identify that the given time of 50 seconds is the *proper time* (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the reference frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** One must apply the correct formula. Using `Δt = Δt' / γ` would be incorrect and would lead to option B.\n*   **Classical vs. Relativistic:** A purely classical calculation (`d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`) ignores time dilation and leads to option C. The relativistic answer must be greater than the classical one in this case because the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is longer than `Δt'`.\n*   **Consistency of Frames:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the velocity and time as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   **Alternative Method (Length Contraction):** From the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy travels is `d' = v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`. This `d'` is a contracted length of the actual path `d` in the Galaxy's frame. The formula is `d' = d / γ`, so the proper path length is `d = d' * γ = 3,000,000 * γ = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`, which confirms the result.\n\nFinal calculation is `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862` km. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
