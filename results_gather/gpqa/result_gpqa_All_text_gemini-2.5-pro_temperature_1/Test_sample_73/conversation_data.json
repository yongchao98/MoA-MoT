    "This problem involves the physics of radioactive decay, which is mathematically described by an exponential distribution. The key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\".\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the mathematical model of radioactive decay.**\nThe probability that an atomic nucleus will survive (not decay) for a time $t$ is given by the formula:\n$P_{survive}(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\nConsequently, the probability that the atom will decay *within* a time $t$ is:\n$P_{decay}(t) = 1 - P_{survive}(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$\n\n**Step 2: Use the given information to find the parameters of the model.**\nWe are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nUsing our formula:\n$P_{decay}(100) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.32$\nFrom this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n$P_{survive}(100) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$\nThis value, $e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68$, will be very useful. We don't need to calculate the value of $\\lambda$ itself.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay.**\nThe question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes.\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of decay in any future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. The \"clock\" effectively resets at any point we observe the atom is still present.\nTherefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed is irrelevant to the future probability.\nThe problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required probability.**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is $P_{decay}(150)$.\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - P_{survive}(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}$\nNow, we use the information from Step 2 to solve this. We know that $e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68$. We can rewrite the exponent in our target equation:\n$e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1.5} = (e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100})^{1.5}$\nNow substitute the value we found:\n$e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = (0.68)^{1.5}$\nSo, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the final calculation.**\nCalculate the value of $(0.68)^{1.5}$:\n$(0.68)^{1.5} = 0.68 \\times \\sqrt{0.68} \\approx 0.68 \\times 0.8246 \\approx 0.5607$\nNow, calculate the final probability:\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393$\n\n**Step 6: Convert to a percentage and choose the correct option.**\nThe probability is 0.4393, which is equivalent to 43.93%.\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   Do not get confused by the 50 minutes that have passed. The memoryless property is the key shortcut.\n*   Distinguish between the probability of decay ($1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$) and the probability of survival ($e^{-\\lambda t}$).\n*   Properly use the rules of exponents to solve for the final probability without needing to explicitly find the value of $\\lambda$. This avoids intermediate rounding errors.\n\n<<<A>>>"
