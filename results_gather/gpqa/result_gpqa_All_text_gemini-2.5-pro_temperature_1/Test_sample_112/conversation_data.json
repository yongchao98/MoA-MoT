    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** A broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the hallmark of an O-H stretch within a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also broad but typically appears higher, around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. The position at 3000 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Carboxylic acids typically absorb in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range. This observation is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Analysis:** This peak is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (alkene), which typically appears between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicates the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum provides information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens.\n    *   **Analysis:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule. This supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\nMass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of the molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5:** A fragment peak at m/z = 45.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to calculate the mass of potential fragments. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. The [COOH]⁺ ion is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** This observation provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have established that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Let's use this information to evaluate the given chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n\nWe are left with two options: B) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7:** We need to check for consistency with the degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our compound has a C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C bond (from the alkene). This means it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option B: C6H10O2**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula fits all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D: C6H12O2**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for a single double bond (e.g., the C=O in a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid) or a single ring. It cannot account for the presence of *both* a C=O and a C=C bond. This formula is inconsistent with the combined FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of at least 2. Of the choices provided, only C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>"
