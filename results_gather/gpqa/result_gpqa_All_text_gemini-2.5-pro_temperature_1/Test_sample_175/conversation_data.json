    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. First, we measure observable P and get the result 0. Then, immediately after, we measure observable Q and get the result -1. The total probability is the product of the probability of the first event and the conditional probability of the second event.\nP(P=0 and then Q=-1) = P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | after P=0 measurement)\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Initial state vector (unnormalized): `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   Operator P: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   Operator Q: `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step I: Normalize the Initial State**\nA state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1 for probability calculations.\n*   Calculate the square of the norm (length): `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalization constant is `N = 1/√6`.\n*   The normalized initial state is: `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n**Step II: Analyze the First Measurement (P=0)**\nTo find the probability of measuring P=0, we need the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n*   **Find the eigenvalues of P:** Solve `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n    `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1-λ²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues of P are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n*   **Find the eigenvector for λ=0:** Solve `(P - 0I)|v⟩ = 0` for `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x = -z`\n    An unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n*   **Normalize the eigenvector:** The squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`. The normalized eigenvector for P=0 is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:** This is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector: `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0 | ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p_0 | ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n**Step III: State Collapse**\nAfter the first measurement yields P=0, the system's state \"collapses\" to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. This becomes the new state of the system for the next measurement.\n*   New state: `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step IV: Analyze the Second Measurement (Q=-1)**\nNow we measure observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩` and want to find the probability of getting the result -1.\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q=-1:** The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue Q=-1 is `|q_-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`. (This is already normalized).\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:** This is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state `|ψ'⟩` onto the eigenvector `|q_-1⟩`: `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |⟨q_-1 | ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q_-1 | ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n**Step V: Calculate the Total Probability**\nThe final probability is the product of the probabilities from Step II and Step IV.\n*   `P(total) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0)`\n*   `P(total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
