    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In any closed system, the total energy remains constant. For this relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$, where:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy at position $x$.\n\n2.  **Define the states of the system.**\n    We need to compare the energy of the oscillator at two key points in its motion:\n    *   **State 1: At the maximum amplitude (turning point).**\n        *   Position: $x = A$.\n        *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The potential energy, governed by Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$), is $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy in this state is:\n            $E_1 = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + U(A) = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **State 2: At the equilibrium position.**\n        *   Position: $x = 0$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its minimum, $U(0) = 0$.\n        *   The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The total energy in this state is:\n            $E_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy must be the same in both states, so $E_1 = E_2$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the maximum Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Divide both sides of the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{max} mc^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to relate $\\gamma_{max}$ to $v_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Let's rearrange this equation to solve for $v_{max}$.\n    *   First, invert both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Isolate the velocity term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n6.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into the equation for $v_{max}$.**\n    We found that $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$. Substituting this into our equation for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
