    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars (`N`) and their parallax (`plx`): `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with...\" typically refers to a cumulative count. So, we interpret `N` as the total number of stars observed with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(>plx)`. Stars with a parallax *greater* than `plx` are *closer* than the corresponding distance `r`.\n    *   So, the given relation is: `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Parallax-Distance Relationship:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related: `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   This means `r = 1/plx`. We are interested in the proportionality, so `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n4.  **Convert the Number Count from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We have the cumulative number of stars as a function of parallax. We want to express it as a function of distance.\n    *   The number of stars within a distance `r` is `N(<r)`. This is the same set of stars as those with parallax greater than `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   So, we can substitute `plx = 1/r` into our given relation:\n        `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n        `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This physically represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    *   We differentiate the cumulative count `N(<r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `N(<r) = C * r⁵` (where C is a constant of proportionality)\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n        `dN/dr = C * 5 * r⁴`\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The derived relationship `dN/dr ∝ r⁴` matches option A.\n\nTo be certain of the calculus and substitutions, we can use a symbolic math library.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff\n\n# Define symbols for parallax (plx), distance (r), and a constant of proportionality (k)\nplx, r, k = symbols('plx r k')\n\n# Given relationship: The cumulative number of stars N is proportional to plx^-5\n# We represent this as N_cumulative = k * plx**-5\nN_cumulative_plx = k * plx**-5\n\n# Relationship between distance and parallax: plx = 1/r\nplx_in_terms_of_r = 1 / r\n\n# Substitute to get the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance r\n# This is N(<r), the number of stars within distance r\nN_cumulative_r = N_cumulative_plx.subs(plx, plx_in_terms_of_r)\n# N_cumulative_r is k * (1/r)**-5 which simplifies to k * r**5\n\n# The question asks for how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance.\n# This is the derivative of the cumulative number with respect to distance, dN/dr.\ndN_dr = diff(N_cumulative_r, r)\n\n# The result is 5*k*r**4. The proportionality is r**4.\nprint(f\"The number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, is proportional to: r**{diff(N_cumulative_r, r).as_poly(r).degree()}\")\n```\n> The number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, is proportional to: r**4\n\nThe code confirms the manual calculation. The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. In astronomical contexts, \"number of stars\" typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed that are brighter or closer than a certain limit. In this case, it means the number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    Here, `N(>plx)` is the total number of stars with parallax greater than the value `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely proportional. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a star at distance `r` has a parallax of `1/r`. Consequently, all stars with a parallax greater than `plx` are located within the distance `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:** We can now rewrite the relationship from step 1 in terms of distance `r`. The number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than `1/r`.\n    Substituting `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance\". This is the star number density with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to the distance `r`.\n    Let `N(<r) = C * r⁵`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
