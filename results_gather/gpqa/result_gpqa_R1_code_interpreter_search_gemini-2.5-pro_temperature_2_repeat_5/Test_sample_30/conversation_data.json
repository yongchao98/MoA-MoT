    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of an aromatic ring. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) reacts with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), which generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺) electrophile.\n*   **Substrate:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-director. Mononitration would yield a mixture of o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Plausible Assumption:** For the subsequent reactions to lead to a product with one of the given high-symmetry point groups, a highly symmetric intermediate is often required. This suggests that the initial nitration is exhaustive, proceeding under harsh conditions to form **2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)**. We will proceed with this assumption, as starting with mononitrotoluene leads to final products with C₁ symmetry, which is not an option.\n*   **Product 1:** 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** TNT, Manganese dioxide (MnO₂), and Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** MnO₂ in an acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid. The three nitro groups are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of TNT is oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The product is **2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid (TNBA)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid (TNBA), acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O), and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   This step involves two key transformations:\n    1.  **Decarboxylation:** 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzoic acid is a highly substituted benzoic acid with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Such molecules are known to undergo facile decarboxylation (loss of CO₂) in the presence of base or upon heating. The basic aqueous NaOH promotes this reaction.\n        TNBA → **1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB)** + CO₂\n    2.  **Meisenheimer Complex Formation:** Sodium hydroxide also acts as a base to deprotonate acetone, forming the nucleophilic acetone enolate (⁻CH₂COCH₃). This enolate then attacks the highly electron-deficient aromatic ring of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB). This type of nucleophilic addition to an electron-poor aromatic ring forms a stable, colored, anionic σ-complex known as a **Meisenheimer complex**. This is Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The acetone enolate adds to one of the three equivalent C-H positions on the TNB ring. The resulting structure is a cyclohexadienyl anion. The carbon atom that is attacked becomes sp³-hybridized and is bonded to both a hydrogen atom and the -CH₂COCH₃ group. The negative charge is delocalized across the π-system of the ring and is stabilized by the three electron-withdrawing nitro groups.\n\n### **Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\nLet's determine the point group of the Meisenheimer complex formed from TNB and acetone.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered, non-planar ring.\n    *   One carbon (let's call it C1) is sp³-hybridized and bears a hydrogen atom and a -CH₂COCH₃ substituent.\n    *   Nitro groups are attached at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   There is a delocalized negative charge.\n\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** We look for symmetry elements in the molecule's most stable conformation.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂ or higher-order rotation axes. Rotating the molecule around any axis will not result in an identical configuration because of the unique -CH₂COCH₃ substituent.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric. For instance, there is a large substituent on C1 but not on the opposite side of the ring.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** The molecule can adopt a conformation that possesses a single plane of symmetry. This plane contains:\n        *   The atoms C1 and C4 of the ring.\n        *   The H atom attached to C1.\n        *   The NO₂ group attached to C4.\n        *   The C-C-O skeleton of the acetone substituent.\n        This plane acts as a mirror, reflecting the C2 part of the ring into the C6 part, and the C3 part into the C5 part. The two hydrogens of the -CH₂ group are also reflections of each other across this plane.\n\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nBased on the plausible reaction pathway leading to a Meisenheimer complex, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<A>>>"
