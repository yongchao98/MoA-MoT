    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\n    The mixture of gases from the heated salts is passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify the components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. Therefore, the mass of O₂ gas produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that does not react in any of the tubes remains. We have 2.24 L of this gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each product.**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.00 g/mol.\n        Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C:**\n        At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas C.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts.\n    *   Total mass = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass (C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂), since the molar mass of N is ~14 g/mol (2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol).\n\n4.  **Determine the total elemental composition of the salts.**\n    The salts A and B must contain all the atoms found in the products (H, O, N), as nothing else was added.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n5.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The initial mixture contained an equimolar amount of salt A and salt B. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. The total atomic composition we found above (0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, 0.25 mol O) is distributed between `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\n    Let's find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A + B).\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    Ratio: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\n    So, the combination of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must contain a total of 8 H atoms, 4 N atoms, and 5 O atoms.\n\n    The salts are formed from H, N, and O. Common salts of this type are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Let's see if we can construct the salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), which contains 1 N and 4 H.\n    *   Our total H atom count is 8. This corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × 4 H = 8 H).\n    *   This implies that each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion:\n        *   Salt A = NH₄(Anion_A)\n        *   Salt B = NH₄(Anion_B)\n    *   Now let's account for the remaining atoms. We have used 2 N atoms and 8 H atoms.\n        *   Remaining N atoms = 4 (total) - 2 (in NH₄⁺ ions) = 2 N atoms.\n        *   Remaining O atoms = 5 (total) - 0 = 5 O atoms.\n    *   These remaining 2 N and 5 O atoms must make up the two anions (Anion_A and Anion_B). Common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit:\n        *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻) has 1 N and 2 O.\n        *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻) has 1 N and 3 O.\n    *   Total atoms from these two anions: (1+1) N and (2+3) O = 2 N and 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their formula units).\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nFinal check of the mass:\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 64.05 g/mol\nMolar Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 80.05 g/mol\nLet's find the number of moles `n` from the product data. Based on the decomposition 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or 1 NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O), the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, where 0.5*n = 0.025, so n = 0.05 moles.\nLet's check the mass with n = 0.05 mol:\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol × (64.05 g/mol) + 0.05 mol × (80.05 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms our calculations.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
