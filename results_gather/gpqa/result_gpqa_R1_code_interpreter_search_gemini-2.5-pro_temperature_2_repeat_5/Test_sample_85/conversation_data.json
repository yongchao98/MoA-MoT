    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The product name is `(R)-` or `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n*   **Pyran**: Indicates a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **-2-one**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. Numbering in such heterocycles starts with the oxygen as position 1 and proceeds towards the carbonyl group.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring. This is the chiral center.\n*   **(R)/(S)**: Specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone. Such lactones are typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Let's determine the open-chain precursor.\n\nBreaking the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone gives the hydroxy acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\nLet's name this precursor acid. The main chain has 5 carbons with a carboxylic acid group, so it is a pentanoic acid. Numbering starts from the carboxylic carbon (C1).\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\nThe name is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nWhen this hydroxy acid cyclizes, the C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone is directly inherited from the hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Although the name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The structure is an acid-ester:\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\nNumbering from the free acid group (C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent that is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones but **does not reduce carboxylic acids** (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The reduction at C5 does not affect the chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of starting material A is passed on to the hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must be `(R)`. This requires the starting material A to have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis finding eliminates options B and D.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`, often used as `BH3-THF`) is also a reducing agent, but with a different selectivity compared to `LiBH4`. `BH3` selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    3.  The reduction at C1 does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of B is passed on to the hydroxy ester intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, causing cyclization to form the same lactone structure and release isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must be `(S)`. This requires the starting material B to have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
