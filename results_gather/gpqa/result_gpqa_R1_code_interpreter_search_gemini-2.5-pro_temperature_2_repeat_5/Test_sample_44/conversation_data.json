    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System Properties:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being identical, they are indistinguishable. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s`.\n    *   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   **State Degeneracy:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin up (`m_s = +1/2`) and spin down (`m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two fermions.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n    *   **n = 1 (E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Total energy from this level = `2 * 1E = 2E`.\n    *   **n = 2 (E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Total energy from this level = `2 * 4E = 8E`.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n        `E_g = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the lowest possible energy state above the ground state. It is achieved by making the smallest possible energy jump for one particle. This means promoting a particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2. The HOMO is n=2, and the LUMO is n=3.\n    *   **Excitation:** We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n        *   Two particles in **n = 1** (Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * 1E = 2E`)\n        *   One particle in **n = 2** (Energy = `1 * E_2 = 1 * 4E = 4E`)\n        *   One particle in **n = 3** (Energy = `1 * E_3 = 1 * 3^2 * E = 9E`)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state and find the minimum among them.\n    *   **Ground State:** [2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2]. Energy = 10E.\n    *   **First Excited State:** [2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3]. Energy = 15E.\n\n    Let's examine the next possible excitations:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: [1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3]\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: [2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3]\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: [2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 0 in n=3, 1 in n=4]\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these new excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n5.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n    *   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
