    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   Starting Material: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Bromine (Br₂), pyridine (a base), and acetic anhydride.\n    *   This combination of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + Br₂ → BrCH₂COOH + HBr.\n    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   Starting Material: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   Reagents: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, an acid catalyst).\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ester.\n    *   The reaction is: BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   Starting Material: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and bromide (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon is activated for S_N2 as it is alpha to a carbonyl group.\n    *   The reaction is: BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Starting Material: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagents: Sodium hydride (NaH, a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   The methylene protons (-CH₂-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester). This reaction is a tandem alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Deprotonation:** NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n           NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        b. **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        c. **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n           NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        d. **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring.\n           The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Step 2: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n      C  - C(=O)O-CH₂-CH₃\n     / \\\n  H₂C   CH₂\n  |     |\n  H₂C   CH₂\n   \\   /\n    CH₂\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane with two different substituents (like -CN and -COOEt) is an **achiral** molecule. At room temperature, due to rapid chair-chair interconversion, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons (and the protons on them) equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C1 and C4 are unique as they lie on the plane of symmetry.\n\nNow, we count the chemically distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, the two protons on the methylene (-CH₂-) group are chemically equivalent. They will appear as one signal (a quartet).\n    *   The three protons on the methyl (-CH₃) group are also equivalent and will appear as one signal (a triplet).\n    *   **Total signals from the ethyl group: 2**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The carbons C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the axial (Hₐₓ) and equatorial (Hₑq) protons are **diastereotopic**. This means H2ₐₓ is not equivalent to H2ₑq. The plane of symmetry makes the proton H2ₐₓ equivalent to H6ₐₓ, and H2ₑq equivalent to H6ₑq. This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on these carbons.\n    *   **Total signals from C2/C6: 2**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry renders H3ₐₓ equivalent to H5ₐₓ, and H3ₑq equivalent to H5ₑq. This gives two more distinct signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C3/C5: 2**\n    *   **C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (H4ₐₓ and H4ₑq) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Thus, they give two different signals.\n    *   **Total signals from C4: 2**\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the C2/C6 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C3/C5 positions: 2 signals\n*   From the C4 position: 2 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
