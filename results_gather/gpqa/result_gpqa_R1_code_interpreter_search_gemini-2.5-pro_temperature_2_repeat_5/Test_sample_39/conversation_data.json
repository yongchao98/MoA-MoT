    "This is a common expression in a synthetic chemistry lab, particularly when discussing purification and analysis of reaction mixtures. The most common techniques for purification and analysis in this setting are chromatography-based, such as Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.\n\n1.  **Analyze the phrase:** \"On top of each other\" is a visual metaphor. It suggests that when trying to separate and visualize the components of a mixture, two or more of those components are appearing in the same location, making them inseparable by the current method.\n\n2.  **Connect to Chemistry Techniques:**\n    *   **Chromatography (TLC, Column, HPLC, etc.):** This is the primary method for separating compounds in a synthetic lab. The separation is based on the differential partitioning of compounds between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and a mobile phase (the solvent). This partitioning is governed almost entirely by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n    *   On a TLC plate, compounds appear as spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel the same distance up the plate, and their spots will be \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   In column chromatography, compounds are eluted from a column over time. If two compounds have similar polarities, they will elute at the same time and be collected in the same fractions. The peaks on a chromatogram would be \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   This makes \"similar polarities\" a very strong candidate for what the chemist is referring to.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property measured on an already purified, chiral compound. It's not a separation technique itself. You can't separate compounds based on their optical rotation. So, if the compounds are unseparated (\"on top of each other\"), the chemist wouldn't be measuring their individual optical rotations yet.\n    *   **B) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While a possibility, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more frequently and directly associated with the visual output of chromatography (spots on a plate, peaks on a chromatogram) than it is with distillation.\n    *   **D) Non-covalent interactions:** These interactions (like van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding) are the *underlying physical reason* for a compound's polarity and boiling point. However, the chemist is referring to the observational result of a failed separation, which is the macroscopic property (like polarity), not the microscopic forces causing it. The direct problem is that the polarities are too similar to allow for separation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is an idiomatic expression used by chemists to describe a failed or difficult chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds of interest have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
