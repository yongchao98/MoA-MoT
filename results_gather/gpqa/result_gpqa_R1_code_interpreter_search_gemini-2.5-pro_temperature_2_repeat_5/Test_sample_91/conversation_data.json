    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to determine its molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n```\n      CH3      H          CH3        H      CH3\n       \\        /            |         \\      /\n     C(1)=C(2)--C(3)H2--C(4)H--C(5)H2--C(6)=C(7)\n    /                      |                   \\\n  CH3                      CH3                  CH3\n```\n-   **Carbon atoms (C):** There are 7 carbons in the main chain and 5 carbons in the methyl (CH3) side groups. Total C = 7 + 5 = 12.\n-   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** We count the hydrogens attached to each carbon:\n    -   (CH3)2C-: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    -   =CH-: 1 H\n    -   -CH2-: 2 H\n    -   -CH(CH3)-: 1 + 3 = 4 H\n    -   -CH2-: 2 H\n    -   -CH=: 1 H\n    -   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    -   Total H = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\n-   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n\nNow, let's count the bonds:\n-   **C-H bonds:** Since there are 22 H atoms, there are 22 C-H bonds.\n-   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure.\n-   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure: 4 in the main chain (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6) and 5 connecting the methyl groups to the chain. Total C-C = 4 + 5 = 9.\n-   **Total bonds check:** For an acyclic molecule, total bonds = (Number of atoms) - 1. Here, (12 C + 22 H) - 1 = 33 bonds. Our count is 22 (C-H) + 2 (C=C) + 9 (C-C) = 33 bonds. The counts are correct.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants in their standard states into gaseous atoms. This is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization.\n\n-   **For Carbon:** We need 12 moles of gaseous C atoms from 12 moles of solid carbon.\n    Energy = 12 mol * ΔH_at(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n-   **For Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of gaseous H atoms from 11 moles of H2 gas. This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    Energy = 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, C12H22, to form gaseous atoms.\n\n-   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n-   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n-   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\n**Total Bond Energy of Product** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product.\nΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpies of atomization of reactants) - (Σ Bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nLet's review the options provided:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\n- Option D is the total bond energy of the product molecule, not its enthalpy of formation.\n- Option C has the correct numerical value (1900) but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\n- Option B provides the enthalpy in units of kJ/g. Let's perform the unit conversion.\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22. Assuming atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol:\nMolar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert our result to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches Option B.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nH_at_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_H_H = 100   # kJ/mol\nBE_C_C = 200   # kJ/mol\nBE_C_eq_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nBE_C_H = 400   # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula is C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of moles of H2 gas is num_H / 2\nmoles_H2 = num_H / 2\n\n# Number of bonds in C12H22\nnum_C_eq_C = 2\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants\n# Reactants: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g)\nH_at_reactants = (num_C * H_at_C) + (moles_H2 * BE_H_H)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total bond energy of the product\n# Product: C12H22\nBE_product = (num_C_C * BE_C_C) + (num_C_eq_C * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_C_H * BE_C_H)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (in kJ/mol)\n# Delta H_f = H_at_reactants - BE_product\nH_f_mol = H_at_reactants - BE_product\n\n# Step 4: Convert to kJ/g if necessary\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1)\nH_f_gram = H_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants: {H_at_reactants} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total Bond Energy of Product: {BE_product} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {H_f_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of C12H22: {molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {H_f_gram}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nEnthalpy of Atomization of Reactants: 13100.0 kJ/mol\nTotal Bond Energy of Product: 11200 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0 kJ/mol\nMolar Mass of C12H22: 166 g/mol\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option B precisely.\n\n<<<B>>>",
