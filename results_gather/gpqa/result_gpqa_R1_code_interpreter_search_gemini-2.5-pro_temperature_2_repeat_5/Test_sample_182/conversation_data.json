    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure based on the name:\n*   **cyclohex-**: The molecule has a six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: There is a principal functional group, -COOH, attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention, its position is C1.\n*   **-3-ene**: There is a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) in the ring between C3 and C4.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond).\nThe -COOH group itself also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n\nSo, structurally, the reactant molecule contains:\n*   1 ring.\n*   4 π-bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is the sum of rings and π-bonds, which is 1 (ring) + 4 (π-bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction and the transformation\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduces all carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane parts (CH2 or CH3).\n*   Specifically, R-CHO is reduced to R-CH3.\n*   Specifically, R-COOH is reduced to R-CH3.\n\nIn essence, all π-bonds in the molecule are removed, and all oxygen atoms are eliminated. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product\nApplying the effects of the Red P/HI reduction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring. The π-bond in the ring is gone.\n*   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n*   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The C=C π-bond is gone.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane molecule. All functional groups containing π-bonds have been fully saturated. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency is the ring structure itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is given by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n\nFor the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   Number of π-bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product.\n*   Reactant C atoms: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CnH2n.\n*   With n=10, the product's molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula for a molecular formula (C_c H_h O_o N_n X_x):\n    IHD = c - h/2 + n/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
