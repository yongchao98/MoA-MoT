    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$. The uncertainty is defined by the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z^2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   The operator $P_z$ in matrix form:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The state of the system, represented by the column vector (ket) $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe information about operators $P_x$ and $P_y$ and the fact that $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$ confirms the setup but is not directly needed for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$ since the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is explicitly provided. The basis used is the eigenbasis of $P_z$, which is evident from the diagonal form of the $P_z$ matrix.\n\n**3. Represent the Bra Vector**\nThe corresponding bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nUsing the values calculated in the previous steps:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nThe calculated uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
