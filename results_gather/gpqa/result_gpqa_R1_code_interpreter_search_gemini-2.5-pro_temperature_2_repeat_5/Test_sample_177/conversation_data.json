    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Determine the Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d^4x L`\nThe mass dimension of the action is `[S] = 0`.\nThe mass dimension of the four-volume element `d^4x` is `[d^4x] = [length]^4`. Since `length` has a mass dimension of `M^-1`, we have `[d^4x] = M^-4`.\nFor the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension that compensates for `d^4x`.\n`[S] = [L][d^4x] => 0 = [L] - 4`\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is `[L] = M^4`.\nAny term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term `L_int`, must have a mass dimension of `M^4`.\n\n**2. Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\n*   **Fermion Field `ψ`**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_kinetic_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`.\n    We know `[L] = M^4`. The derivative operator `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of `[∂_μ] = M^1`. The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless.\n    So, `[L_kinetic_fermion] = [ψ̄][ψ][∂_μ]`.\n    `M^4 = [ψ̄][ψ]M^1`.\n    Assuming `[ψ̄] = [ψ]`, we get `[ψ]^2 = M^3`, which leads to:\n    `[ψ] = M^(3/2)`\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor `F^μν`**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_kinetic_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`.\n    We know `[L] = M^4`.\n    So, `[L_kinetic_EM] = [F_μν][F^μν] = [F^μν]^2`.\n    `M^4 = [F^μν]^2`, which leads to:\n    `[F^μν] = M^2`\n\n*   **Sigma Matrix `σ_μν`**: This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    `[σ_μν] = M^0`\n\n**3. Calculate the Mass Dimension of `κ`**\n\nNow we analyze the interaction Lagrangian term:\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν`\nThe mass dimension of this term must be `M^4`.\n`[L_int] = [κ][ψ̄][σ_μν][ψ][F^μν]`\nSubstitute the dimensions we found:\n`M^4 = [κ] * M^(3/2) * M^0 * M^(3/2) * M^2`\n`M^4 = [κ] * M^(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)`\n`M^4 = [κ] * M^(3 + 2)`\n`M^4 = [κ] * M^5`\nSolving for the mass dimension of `κ`:\n`[κ] = M^4 / M^5 = M^-1`\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n**4. Determine Renormalizability**\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If `[coupling] ≥ 0`, the theory is renormalizable (or super-renormalizable).\n*   If `[coupling] < 0`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn this case, `[κ] = -1`. Since the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative, the interaction is an \"irrelevant\" operator. In perturbation theory, higher-order corrections would involve higher powers of `κ`, leading to divergences that are increasingly severe and require an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel. This makes the theory non-renormalizable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of `κ` is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
