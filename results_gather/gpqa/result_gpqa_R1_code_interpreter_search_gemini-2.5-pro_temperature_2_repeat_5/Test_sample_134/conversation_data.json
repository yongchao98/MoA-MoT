    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of $m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV}$. The interaction Lagrangian between the boson X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f $$\nThis interaction term describes the decay of the boson X into a fermion-antifermion pair, $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle (the boson X) must be greater than the sum of the masses of the final state particles (the fermion $f$ and its antifermion $\\bar{f}$).\n\nThe condition is:\n$$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X > 2m_f $$\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV}$, we have:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f $$\n$$ m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nThis means the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than 3 GeV.\n\nLet's examine the masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition. The masses are approximately:\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   Up (u): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n*   Down (d): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n*   Charm (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n*   Strange (s): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n*   Top (t): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$ ($> 3$ GeV) -> Forbidden\n*   Bottom (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$ ($> 3$ GeV) -> Forbidden\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   Electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_{\\mu} \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$ ($< 3$ GeV) -> Allowed\n\n(Neutrinos have very small masses, much less than 3 GeV, so decays into neutrino-antineutrino pairs are also kinematically allowed. However, they are not listed in the options provided).\n\nSo, the kinematically allowed decay channels into quark-antiquark and charged lepton-antilepton pairs are:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n$X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n$X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n$X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n$X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n$X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n$X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nNow we compare this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Includes forbidden $t\\bar{t}$)\nB) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Matches our derived list)\nC) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$)\nD) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and excludes $\\mu^+\\mu^-$)\n\nThe correct option is B as it contains all the kinematically allowed decay modes and none of the forbidden ones.\n\n<<<B>>>"
