    "This problem can be solved by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. The relevant physical principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in its time-energy form:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Relate Lifetimes to the Uncertainty Principle:** The lifetime (τ) of a quantum state is the characteristic time duration for which the state exists. We can consider this lifetime as the uncertainty in time, Δt. Therefore, each energy level is not perfectly sharp but has an intrinsic energy \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE) given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n    This energy width is also known as the natural linewidth.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ sec.\n        The energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁.\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ sec.\n        The energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂.\n\n    Notice that since τ₁ < τ₂, the corresponding energy width ΔE₁ will be greater than ΔE₂. The state with the shorter lifetime is less precisely defined in energy (it has a broader energy level).\n\n4.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than their energy widths. The most critical factor is the larger of the two widths, as it limits the resolution. Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE_larger\n\n    In our case, the larger energy width is ΔE₁, corresponding to the shorter lifetime τ₁. So, we must have:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Minimum Energy Difference:** We need to calculate the value of ΔE₁. It's best to use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s for this calculation.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    Now, calculate ΔE₁:\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, to resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (10⁻⁹ < 6.6 × 10⁻⁷, so this is too small)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV  (10⁻⁸ < 6.6 × 10⁻⁷, so this is too small)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (10⁻⁴ > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷, so this is large enough)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (10⁻¹¹ < 6.6 × 10⁻⁷, so this is too small)\n\n    Only option C provides an energy difference that is sufficiently large to resolve the two levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the energy width of the broader state.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\n# The reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# The shorter lifetime, which determines the larger energy width\ntau_short = 1e-9  # in seconds\n\n# Calculate the minimum energy width required for resolution\n# This is determined by the shorter lifetime (tau_short)\nmin_energy_diff = h_bar_eV_s / tau_short\n\nprint(f\"The lifetime of the broader state is {tau_short} s.\")\nprint(f\"The corresponding energy width is approximately {min_energy_diff:.2e} eV.\")\nprint(\"To be resolvable, the energy difference between the levels must be greater than this value.\")\n\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-9,\n    'B': 1e-8,\n    'C': 1e-4,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_diff:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required minimum of {min_energy_diff:.2e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference as it is smaller than the required minimum.\")\n```\n> The lifetime of the broader state is 1e-09 s.\n> The corresponding energy width is approximately 6.58e-07 eV.\n> To be resolvable, the energy difference between the levels must be greater than this value.\n>\n> Checking the options:\n> Option A (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference as it is smaller than the required minimum of 6.58e-07 eV.\n> Option B (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference as it is smaller than the required minimum of 6.58e-07 eV.\n> Option C (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required minimum of 6.58e-07 eV.\n> Option D (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference as it is smaller than the required minimum of 6.58e-07 eV.\n\nBoth manual reasoning and the computational check show that only option C is a valid energy difference for the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem requires us to determine the minimum energy difference needed to distinguish two quantum states based on their lifetimes. This is governed by the time-energy formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Understand the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and the lifetime of that state (Δt) are related by the inequality:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" out over a range ΔE, often called the energy width or natural linewidth of the state. We can approximate the minimum energy width as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nHere, the lifetime τ of the state is our Δt.\n\n**2. Identify the Limiting Factor:**\nWe have two states with lifetimes:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ sec\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ sec\n\nEach state has a corresponding energy width:\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n\nTo clearly resolve or distinguish between the two energy levels E₁ and E₂, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than their individual energy widths. Since the widths are different, the resolvability is limited by the *larger* of the two energy widths.\n\nThe energy width is inversely proportional to the lifetime (ΔE ∝ 1/τ). Therefore, the state with the **shorter lifetime** will have the **larger energy width**.\nIn this case, τ₁ (10⁻⁹ s) is shorter than τ₂ (10⁻⁸ s), so ΔE₁ will be the larger energy width.\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\nThe condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy separation must be greater than the larger energy width, ΔE₁:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n\nLet's calculate this value:\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two levels must be significantly greater than ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options:**\nWe now check which of the given options satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV:  10⁻⁹ is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷. Not resolvable.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV:  10⁻⁸ is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷. Not resolvable.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV: 10⁻⁴ is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷. This difference is large enough for the levels to be clearly resolved.**\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: 10⁻¹¹ is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷. Not resolvable.\n\nTherefore, the only possible energy difference among the options that allows the two energy levels to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
