    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Reactions**\n\nWhen hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) are mixed, two main exothermic (heat-releasing) reactions occur:\n1.  **Neutralization:** Hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acids react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the base to form water.\n    H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n    The standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°ₙ) between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately **-57.1 kJ/mol** or **-13.7 kcal/mol**.\n\n2.  **Precipitation:** Barium ions (Ba²⁺) from Ba(OH)₂ react with sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from H₂SO₄ to form a solid precipitate of barium sulfate.\n    Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n    This reaction also releases heat.\n\nThe question asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization.\" In this context, we will first calculate the heat released specifically by the neutralization reaction, as this is the primary definition. We can then check if this value matches the given options.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Moles of Reactants**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of H⁺ ions and OH⁻ ions available for neutralization.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions:**\n    *   From 0.2 M HCl in 500 mL (0.5 L):\n        Moles H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   From 0.3 M H₂SO₄ in 300 mL (0.3 L):\n        H₂SO₄ is a strong acid that provides two H⁺ ions per molecule.\n        Moles H⁺ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L × 2 = 0.18 mol\n    *   **Total Moles of H⁺** = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = **0.28 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   From 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ in 200 mL (0.2 L):\n        Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides two OH⁻ ions per molecule.\n        Moles OH⁻ = 0.5 mol/L × 0.2 L × 2 = **0.20 mol**\n\n### **3. Determine the Limiting Reactant and Heat of Neutralization**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\nWe compare the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) and OH⁻ (0.20 mol).\nSince there are fewer moles of OH⁻, it is the **limiting reactant**.\nThe reaction will consume all 0.20 moles of OH⁻ and 0.20 moles of H⁺. Therefore, **0.20 moles of water** will be formed by neutralization.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat released (enthalpy change, ΔH).\n\n*   Using the standard value in kJ/mol:\n    ΔH = (moles of H₂O formed) × (enthalpy of neutralization)\n    ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = **-11.42 kJ**\n\n*   Using the standard value in kcal/mol:\n    ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = **-2.74 kcal**\n\n### **4. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) -11.42 kcal\nB) -16.0 kJ\nC) -3.80 kcal\nD) -2.72 kcal\n\nOur calculated value of **-2.74 kcal** is extremely close to option **D) -2.72 kcal**. The slight difference is likely due to using a more precise value for the enthalpy of neutralization or the kcal-to-kJ conversion factor. If we use the value -11.42 kJ and convert it using the factor 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ:\n-11.42 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal = -2.729 kcal, which rounds to -2.73 kcal. This confirms that the intended answer only considers the heat from the neutralization reaction.\n\n(Note: If we were to include the heat from the precipitation of BaSO₄, the total heat evolved would be approximately -3.15 kcal, which does not match any of the options).\n\nThus, the calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
