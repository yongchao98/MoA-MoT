    "*   **Initial State Analysis:** The 2-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1=1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2=1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m=-1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n*   **Measurement:** We are measuring the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The possible eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$, where $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ since $l_1=1$.\n    *   The possible eigenvalues of $L_{2z}$ are $m_2\\hbar$, where $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ since $l_2=1$.\n\n*   **The Question:** We want to find the joint probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ simultaneously. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, the total operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. Therefore, the quantum numbers must satisfy the relation $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   The system is in a state with a definite total z-component quantum number, $m=-1$.\n    *   This means that any measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ must yield a pair of values whose sum is -1.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Desired Outcome:** The measurement we are interested in is the outcome where we find $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n    *   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   The sum of these desired measurement outcomes is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   However, the system is in a state where the total z-component quantum number is $m=-1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the required sum of the individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$) does not match the system's total z-component quantum number ($m=-1$), it is impossible to obtain this result. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is orthogonal to the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$. An outcome that violates a conservation law (in this case, the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum) has a probability of zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
