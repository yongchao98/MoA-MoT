    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the given operators\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThese are the standard spin-1/2 operators, where $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$, and the matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$).\n\n### 2. Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$\nThe operator is to be calculated along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We can satisfy this by setting the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\nThus, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nHere, $\\theta$ represents the angle between the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.\n\n### 3. Construct the operator $P_n$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$\nThe operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$.\n$P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operator matrices:\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n$P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\nNow, factor out $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ and combine the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 4. Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis matrix equation expands into a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we solve for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\nThis relationship tells us that the eigenvector must be of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere $C$ is a normalization constant. For example, if we let $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\n### 5. Normalize the eigenvector\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, which means its inner product with itself must be 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. For a column vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, this condition is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|C \\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |C \\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nSince $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$, we get:\n$|C|^2 = 1$\nWe can choose the simplest positive real value for the constant, $C=1$.\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
