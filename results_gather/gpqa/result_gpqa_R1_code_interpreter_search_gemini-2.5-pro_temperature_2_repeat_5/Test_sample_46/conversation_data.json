    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which fits with the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (**-NH2**) group. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but is usually coupled with a lower frequency C=O stretch.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n    *   Combining these two points, the data suggests the presence of both a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is a classic signature for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (**-NH2**). The broadness is due to rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These are two doublets in the aromatic region of the spectrum, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   An amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, which shields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a higher field/lower ppm).\n        *   An ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a lower field/higher ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on all the evidence, we have:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group. Its NMR signal (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would be around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and the broad 2H signal for -NH2 in the NMR.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has a primary amide (-CONH2), which typically has a C=O stretch below 1700 cm-1. Also, the 1,3-(meta) substitution pattern would give a more complex set of signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
