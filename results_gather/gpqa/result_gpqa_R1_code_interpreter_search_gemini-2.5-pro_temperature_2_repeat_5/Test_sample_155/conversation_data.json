    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture using two different types of chromatography.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step process results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. Specifically, a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups. A useful mnemonic for this type of reaction is: **\"Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, acid-catalyzed attack by water at C4 leads to the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since oct-4-ene is symmetrical, the resulting diol (octane-4,5-diol) has two identical substituents on the stereogenic carbons (a propyl group and a hydrogen). Therefore, the (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) configurations represent the same single, achiral **meso** compound. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also lead to the same meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a cis-alkene. This syn-addition yields a meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (this is the cis-epoxide).\n    *   The second step is the anti-addition opening of this meso-epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is: **\"Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide, attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration from S to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol, are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** (50:50) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **P+** and **P-**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol)\n2.  **P+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol)\n3.  **P-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   P+ and P- are **enantiomers**.\n*   M is a **diastereomer** of both P+ and P-.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. P+/P-) have different physical properties and will thus have different retention times, leading to separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (like P+ and P-) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the racemic pair (P+ and P-).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three compounds (M, P+, and P-) are distinct stereoisomers, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Enantiomers P+ and P- will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The diastereomer M will also have a different retention time from both P+ and P-.\n    *   Assuming ideal resolution, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for M, one for P+, and one for P-.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
