    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the information from the characterization techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group class but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single bonds between carbons), so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. According to the n+1 rule:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1, multiplicity=1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, multiplicity=2+1=3).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, multiplicity=3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to a different group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in finding the single molecule that would produce *both* of these unique splitting patterns.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the proposed structures. The way the condensed formulas are written implies a sequential backbone.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** None of the other protons (H(a), CH₂, CH₃) are coupled to one proton, a group of two, and another group of two protons. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtt signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - CH₂ - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(a):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Other protons:** Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H and 3H). This would give a doublet of quartets of quartets (or a doublet of septets if the methyls were equivalent). No proton in this molecule would produce a dtt signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(C₂H₅) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ of the main chain (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** We now need to find a dtq signal (a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors). Let's check the methylene protons. The -CH₂- protons in the main chain are coupled to H(b) (1H) and the terminal -CH₃ (3H). They would give a doublet of quartets (dq). The -CH₂- protons within the ethyl groups are also coupled to one methine proton (H(a) or H(b)) and one methyl group, which would also result in a dq. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtq signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure as written: a backbone of `C-C-C-C-COOH` with specified substituents.\n`CH₃(a) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - C(e)H(C₂H₅) - C(h)H₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The CH₃(a) group (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n    2.  The methine proton H(e) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e):** This proton also has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The methine proton H(b) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    2.  The CH₂(h) group (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nCompound C is the only candidate that possesses protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR data. It has one proton environment that results in a dtq signal and a different proton environment that results in a dtt signal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
