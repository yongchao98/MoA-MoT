    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Concept of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for MFP is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem presents two different scenarios for calculating the mean free path in the same sample compartment, meaning the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is the same in both cases.\n\n**Scenario 1: Molecule-Molecule Collisions (λ₁)**\n\n*   **Moving particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   **Target particles:** Other gas molecules.\n*   Since both the moving and target particles are in motion, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator.\n*   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (`σ_gas-gas`). This is related to the physical size of the molecules (their kinetic diameter).\n*   The formula for λ₁ is: **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n**Scenario 2: Electron-Molecule Collisions (λ₂)**\n\n*   **Moving particles:** High-energy electrons from the TEM beam (1000 kV).\n*   **Target particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   Since the electrons are extremely fast compared to the relatively slow-moving gas molecules, the gas molecules can be considered stationary. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n*   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_electron-gas`).\n*   The formula for λ₂ is: **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n### **3. Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n\nSimplifying by canceling `n`:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)**\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n*   **σ_gas-gas:** This is the kinetic cross-section, essentially the physical \"target size\" one molecule presents to another. It's on the order of the molecule's geometric area.\n*   **σ_electron-gas:** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. The electron in the TEM has an extremely high energy (1000 keV, or 1 MeV). Such a high-energy particle is highly penetrating. It \"zips\" past the gas molecules with very little time for interaction. The probability of it being significantly deflected (a \"collision\") is very low. This means it has a very small effective collision cross-section.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule's kinetic cross-section:\n\n**σ_electron-gas << σ_gas-gas**\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nNow, let's substitute this finding back into our ratio equation:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\nSince `σ_gas-gas` is much larger than `σ_electron-gas`, the ratio `(σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\n\nThis means:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a large number) >> √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nSo, λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁, and the upper limit is less than the theoretical minimum ratio of √2 (which would occur if the cross-sections were equal).\n*   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: **Correct**. Since we have firmly established that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁ (λ₂ >> 1.414 * λ₁), it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ₁. This is the only statement that aligns with the physical reality.\n*   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics of the two types of collisions are different, so the MFPs must also be different.\n\n<<<C>>>"
