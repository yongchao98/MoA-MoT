    "Here is a breakdown of Maxwell's equations and how the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect them.\n\n### Standard Maxwell's Equations (in a vacuum)\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:**  `∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀`\n    *   **Meaning:** The divergence (outward flow from a point) of the electric field (`E`) is proportional to the density of electric charge (`ρ`). This means electric charges (monopoles, like protons and electrons) are the sources and sinks of electric fields.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `∇ ⋅ B = 0`\n    *   **Meaning:** The divergence of the magnetic field (`B`) is zero. This mathematically states that there are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops; they never start or end at a point.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`\n    *   **Meaning:** The curl (circulation) of the electric field is caused by a time-varying magnetic field. This is the principle behind electric generators.\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** `∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t)`\n    *   **Meaning:** The curl (circulation) of the magnetic field is caused by electric currents (`J`) and by time-varying electric fields. This is the principle behind electromagnets.\n\n### How Magnetic Monopoles Change the Equations\n\nIf we discover magnetic monopoles (isolated North and South poles), we would have to account for \"magnetic charge\" (`ρ_m`) and \"magnetic current\" (`J_m`). This introduces a beautiful symmetry to the equations.\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** `∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀`\n    *   **Change:** Unchanged. This equation deals only with electric charges.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** Would become `∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρ_m`\n    *   **Change:** This is the most direct and fundamental change. The equation would no longer be zero. It would state that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (`ρ_m`). This is the very definition of a magnetic monopole acting as a source or sink for the magnetic field. This equation is related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** Would become `∇ × E = - (∂B/∂t + μ₀J_m)`\n    *   **Change:** To maintain consistency and symmetry, a moving magnetic charge would constitute a magnetic current (`J_m`). Just as an electric current creates a curling magnetic field, a magnetic current would create a curling electric field. This equation is related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** `∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t)`\n    *   **Change:** Unchanged. This equation deals with the sources of the curling magnetic field, which are still electric currents and changing electric fields.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n*   Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**).\n*   Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the **circulation of the electric field**).\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
