    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra to Determine Its Structure**\n\nThe problem provides the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the product formed from the reaction of compound X (C11H12O).\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\nThe spectrum shows the following signals:\n*   δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet integrating to 3 protons, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) not adjacent to any protons. Let's call this Me(A).\n*   δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for a methyl group (CH₃). Let's call this Me(B).\n*   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern (an A₂B₂ system) is highly characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing, which explains the significant difference in chemical shifts between the two pairs of protons.\n*   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): Two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. These are coupled to each other and are in the chemical shift range for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). This suggests a `-CH=CH-` group, likely in a trans configuration, which gives clean doublets with a large coupling constant.\n\n**2. Analyze the 13C-NMR Spectrum:**\nThe spectrum shows 9 distinct signals, accounting for all 11 carbons of the C₁₁H₁₂O formula, indicating some symmetry (two pairs of equivalent carbons).\n*   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is characteristic of a ketone or aldehyde carbonyl carbon (C=O). Given the other fragments, it is likely a ketone.\n*   δ 144.1, 141.5, 130.3, 129.1 (2C), 127.1, 126.9 (2C): These 6 signals (accounting for 8 carbons) are in the range for aromatic and vinylic carbons (sp² carbons). The two signals integrating to 2 carbons each (129.1 and 126.9 ppm) correspond to the four C-H carbons on the para-substituted ring.\n*   δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: These two signals are for aliphatic sp³ carbons. These correspond to the two methyl groups observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum. A typical tolyl methyl carbon is ~21 ppm, and a typical acetyl methyl carbon is ~28 ppm.\n\n**3. Assemble the Structure of the Product:**\nLet's put the puzzle pieces together:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   One of the methyl groups, say Me(B) (δ 2.31 in ¹H, δ 21.3 in ¹³C), is attached to the ring, forming a p-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`).\n*   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A `–CH=CH–` group (vinylic protons).\n*   Another methyl group, Me(A) (δ 2.28 in ¹H, δ 28.4 in ¹³C), which is a singlet, meaning it is attached to a non-protonated carbon, like the carbonyl carbon.\n\nLet's arrange these fragments. The most logical structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone:\n**(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃**\nThis structure is (E/Z)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all the NMR data:\n*   **Formula:** (C₇H₇ from p-tolyl) + (C₄H₅O from the butenone chain) = C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n*   **¹H-NMR:**\n    *   p-tolyl-CH₃: One singlet at ~2.3-2.4 ppm. Matches δ 2.31.\n    *   -C(=O)CH₃ (acetyl methyl): One singlet at ~2.3 ppm. Matches δ 2.28.\n    *   p-tolyl ring protons: Two doublets (2H each). Matches the signals at δ 7.08 and δ 7.71. Protons ortho to the methyl group are more shielded (δ 7.08) than protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing vinyl ketone group (δ 7.71).\n    *   Vinylic protons (-CH=CH-): Two doublets. In the system `Ar-CH(β)=CH(α)-C=O`, H(α) is typically δ 6.5-7.0 and H(β) is δ 7.5-8.0. Our signals at δ 6.75 and δ 7.68 fit this perfectly.\n*   **¹³C-NMR:** The assignments also match well: δ 197.7 (C=O), δ 21.3 (tolyl-CH₃), δ 28.4 (acetyl-CH₃), and the remaining signals fit the aromatic and vinylic carbons of this chalcone-like structure.\n\nThe product is confidently identified as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) in a nonpolar solvent. This is an isomerization reaction, as the molecular formula of the reactant and product are the same. We need to find which of the options could isomerize to our identified product.\n\nThe options are all epoxides (oxiranes):\n*   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Has a **phenyl** group (`C₆H₅-`). The product has a **p-tolyl** group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). Therefore, this cannot be compound X.\n*   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Has a **styryl** group (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-`), which contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be compound X.\n*   C) 2-styrylepoxide: Has a molecular formula of C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O. This cannot be compound X.\n*   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: Has a **4-methylstyryl** group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`), which contains the necessary **p-tolyl** group. The formula for this compound is C₁₁H₁₂O. This is the only plausible candidate.\n\n**The Reaction:**\nThe reaction is the base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reactant X (Option D):** `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`\n*   **Product P:** `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n\nThis transformation is a known chemical process. A plausible mechanism involves the base (DABCO) catalyzing an elimination reaction on the epoxide ring to form an enol intermediate `((p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂)`, which then tautomerizes to the more stable keto form (the product).\n\nSince option D is the only one with the correct carbon skeleton (the p-tolyl group) to form the observed product, it must be the correct starting material.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCompound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
