    "*   **Understanding the Concepts**\n    1.  **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ` (rho).\n    2.  **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d`. This implies that `d = 1/plx`. A closer star has a larger parallax, and a more distant star has a smaller parallax.\n    3.  **The Goal:** We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`).\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n    1.  **Volume and Number of Stars:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space around the Earth. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`. The thickness of the shell is `dd`.\n        *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be approximated as the surface area of the inner sphere multiplied by the thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n        *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n    2.  **Changing Variables from Distance (d) to Parallax (plx):** Our expression for `dN` is in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`). We need to convert it to be in terms of parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n        *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n        *   We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n            `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n        *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases (`dd` is positive), parallax `plx` decreases (`d(plx)` is negative). Since we are interested in the number of stars in an interval, we care about the magnitude. So, we'll use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n    3.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        *   Simplifying this gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n    4.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n        *   From the equation in the previous step, we can rearrange to get: `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
