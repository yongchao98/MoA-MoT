One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
