    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves a chemical equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent that binds strongly to metal ions like calcium ($Ca^{2+}$). The reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    Where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated form of EDTA, and $CaY^{2-}$ is the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[CaY^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02$ M.\n    *   The formation constant (or stability constant), $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. This is a very large number, indicating that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex).\n    *   The problem asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** The equilibrium is described by the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n4.  **Consider the Dissociation:** Since we start with the complex, we need to consider its dissociation to find the concentration of free ions at equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n5.  **Use an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions that form upon dissociation.\n\n    | Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |-------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n    | $CaY^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$   | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n    | $Y^{4-}$    | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    From the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of free EDTA ($Y^{4-}$) at equilibrium will also be 'x'.\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the Equation:** Because $K_f$ is extremely large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the dissociation of the complex is very slight. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a valid simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n8.  **Solve for x:** Now, we solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    To make the calculation easier, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nC_complex = 0.02  # Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex in M\nKf = 5e10         # Formation constant\n\n# From the simplified equation: x^2 = C_complex / Kf\n# x represents the concentration of Ca^2+ ions at equilibrium.\nx_squared = C_complex / Kf\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Let's compare this to the given choices:\n    A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
