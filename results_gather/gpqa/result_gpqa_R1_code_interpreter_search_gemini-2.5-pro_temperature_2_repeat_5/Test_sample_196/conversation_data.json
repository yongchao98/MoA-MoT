    "*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield signal, which is a broad singlet, is highly indicative of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis:** Let's assemble the structure of the alkyl chain based on the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H, consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methine (-CH-) and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H in the benzylic position (next to the aromatic ring). This signal corresponds to a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to a methyl group and a methylene group.\n        *   **Assembling the structure of Compound X:**\n            *   We have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring.\n            *   We have an alkyl group attached *para* to the -COOH group.\n            *   The alkyl group has a central CH (the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm). This CH is attached to a -CH₃ group (1.4 ppm) and a -CH₂-CH₃ (ethyl) group (1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm).\n            *   The full alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n            *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) form a powerful reducing agent system.\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is known for the complete reduction of many oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Crucially, it will reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Applying to Compound X:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will not be affected by the reaction.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   Final Product: The product will have a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group in a *para* arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   The name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing our derived product with the options:\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X)\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (This matches our final product)\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (Incorrect alkyl isomer)\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
