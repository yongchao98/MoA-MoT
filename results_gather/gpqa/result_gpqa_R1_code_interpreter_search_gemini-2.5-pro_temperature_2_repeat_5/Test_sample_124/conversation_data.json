    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy eigenvalues, $E_n$, are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Here, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n3.  **Identify the States:**\n    *   The **ground state** is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to $n=0$.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to $n=1$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We need to find the energy for $n=3$. Substituting this value into the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that share the same energy eigenvalue. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the principal quantum number $n$ is the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n    The degeneracy of the energy level $E_n$ is the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum to $n$.\n    The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ is given by:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. We can either use the formula or list the combinations.\n\n    *   **Using the formula:**\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n\n    *   **Listing the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:**\n        1.  (3, 0, 0): Permutations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n        2.  (2, 1, 0): Permutations are (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n        3.  (1, 1, 1): The only permutation is (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n\n        Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   Energy: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   Degeneracy: 10\n    This corresponds to option C. The other options either have incorrect energy expressions (particle in a spherical box) or incorrect degeneracy values.\n\nTo double-check the counting, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# The principal quantum number for the third excited state is n=3.\nn = 3\n\n# Calculate degeneracy by finding all combinations of (nx, ny, nz)\n# where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers and nx + ny + nz = n.\ncount = 0\nfor nx in range(n + 1):\n    for ny in range(n - nx + 1):\n        nz = n - nx - ny\n        # The third loop for nz is not needed as its value is fixed.\n        # This combination is a valid state.\n        count += 1\n        \n# Calculate the energy coefficient for E = (coefficient) * hbar * omega\nenergy_coeff_numerator = 2 * n + 3\nenergy_coeff_denominator = 2\n\nprint(f\"Energy is ({energy_coeff_numerator}/{energy_coeff_denominator}) * hbar * omega\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy is {count}\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Energy is (9/2) * hbar * omega\n> Degeneracy is 10\n\nThe code confirms that for the third excited state (n=3), the energy is (9/2)ħω and the degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2r^2$.\n\n**1. Energy of the 3D Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere:\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n**2. Identifying the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the quantum number $n$:\n*   **Ground State:** $n = 0$\n*   **First Excited State:** $n = 1$\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n = 2$\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n = 3$\n\n**3. Calculating the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nWe substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n$E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\left(\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**4. Degeneracy of the Energy Level**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that have this energy. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the principal quantum number $n$ is related to the Cartesian quantum numbers by $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The degeneracy $g_n$ is the number of ways to choose these three integers to sum to $n$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy of the $n$-th level is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Degeneracy for the Third Excited State**\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$. We substitute this value into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\nThis means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**6. Matching with the Options**\n\n*   Energy value: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option C. Let's check the other options:\n*   A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$: The energy expression is incorrect. It resembles the energy for a particle in a spherical cavity, not a harmonic oscillator.\n*   B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$: The degeneracy is incorrect.\n*   D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$: Both the energy expression and the degeneracy are incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct option is C. The provided code output correctly computes these values, confirming our analytical solution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
