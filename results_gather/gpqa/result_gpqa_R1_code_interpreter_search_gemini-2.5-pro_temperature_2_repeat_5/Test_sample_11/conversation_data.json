    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay. To solve it, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c^2\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c^2\n*   The neutrino (nu) can be considered massless (m_nu = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Before:** Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is just its rest energy, E_initial = m_pi * c^2.\n*   **After:** The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu).\n    *   E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2 (where KE_mu is the kinetic energy of the muon)\n    *   E_nu = p_nu * c (since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy)\n\nThe conservation of energy equation is:\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\nm_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + E_nu  (Equation 1)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Before:** The pion is stationary, so the initial momentum is 0.\n*   **After:** The muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Therefore, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) is equal to the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). Let's call this momentum 'p'.\n    p_mu = p_nu = p  (Equation 2)\n\n**3. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe can find the momentum 'p' using the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2) and the conservation laws. A standard formula derived from these principles for a two-body decay is:\n\npc = [ (m_pi^2 * c^4 - m_mu^2 * c^4)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi * c^2 ]\n(We can omit c^2 and c^4 since the masses are given in MeV/c^2, and the result for 'pc' will be in MeV).\n\nLet's calculate the value of pc.\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate pc using the formula derived from conservation laws\n# pc = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + m_mu^2)\nE_mu = (pc**2 + m_mu**2)**0.5\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.79 MeV\n\nThe calculation shows:\n*   Kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is approximately **4.12 MeV**.\n*   Kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is approximately **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.79).\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a two-body decay problem governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**1. Define the system:**\nThe decay is Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu.\n*   Initial particle: Pion (Pi+)\n*   Product particles: Muon (mu+) and neutrino (nu)\n\n**2. State the given information:**\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary (at rest), so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless (m_nu = 0).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n*   Initial momentum (P_initial) = 0\n*   Final momentum (P_final) = p_mu + p_nu = 0\n*   This implies |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the stationary pion) must equal the total energy after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino).\n*   E_initial = m_pi * c²\n*   E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n*   Therefore, m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²:\n*   For the muon (mu+): E_mu = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino (nu): E_nu = sqrt((pc)² + (0)²) = pc\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_pi * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + pc\n\n**5. Solve for the momentum (p):**\nWe can rearrange the energy equation to solve for the momentum 'p' (or more conveniently, 'pc').\n(m_pi * c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²\nm_pi² * c⁴ - 2 * (m_pi * c²) * (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²\nm_pi² * c⁴ - 2 * m_pi * c² * pc = m_mu² * c⁴\n2 * m_pi * c² * pc = (m_pi² - m_mu²) * c⁴\npc = (m_pi² - m_mu²) * c² / (2 * m_pi)\n\nWe can now plug in the mass values (in units of MeV/c²) to find the value of pc (in units of MeV).\n*   pc = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)\n*   pc = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n*   pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy (KE_nu = E_nu). Also, for a massless particle, E = pc.\n    KE_nu = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):** Its kinetic energy is the difference between its total energy and its rest energy.\n    KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c²\n    KE_mu = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) - m_mu * c²\n    KE_mu = sqrt((29.78)² + (105.7)²) - 105.7\n    KE_mu = sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49) - 105.7\n    KE_mu = sqrt(12059.34) - 105.7\n    KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7\n    KE_mu ≈ 4.11 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (mu+) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (nu).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
