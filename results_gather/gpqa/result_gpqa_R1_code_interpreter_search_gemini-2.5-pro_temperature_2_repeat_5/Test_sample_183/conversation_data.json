    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the positions of the substituents:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents are all adjacent to each other on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern). This is a complex pattern to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is almost always formed by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base (Williamson Ether Synthesis). So, the penultimate molecule is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> Target`. This corresponds to the last step in all the options.\n\n*   **Penultimate Step:** How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is formed from an amino group (-NH2). So, a plausible precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl)--> diazonium salt --(2. H3O+/H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`. These steps are present in the options.\n\n*   **Core Problem:** The main challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** from benzene. This molecule has an amino group at C1, a tBu group at C2, and a nitro group at C3. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern is the crux of the problem. A direct electrophilic substitution approach is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance. For example, trying to nitrate `o-tert-butylaniline` would lead to nitration at positions 4 and 6, not position 3.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences. All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, which is a logical first step.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is flawed. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on nitrobenzene (a strongly deactivated ring) which would be the product of step (i). Thus, **A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\n    1.  Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product.\n    3.  Reduction -> `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    4.  Nitration -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`. (Both tBu and the protonated amine -NH3+ direct to this position).\n    5.  This leads to a final product with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is **not** the desired 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. This reagent is used for diazotization of an amino group, but there is no amino group present at this stage. Thus, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a powerful technique to achieve otherwise difficult substitution patterns.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-butylbenzene` is sulfonated. The bulky tBu group directs *para*. The *para* position is also thermodynamically favored. Product: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tBu group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n    At this point, we have an intermediate with substituents that can be further manipulated. While the subsequent ordering of reagents (v-ix) in option C appears confusing or contains a typo (e.g., step vi seems misplaced), the initial strategy (steps i-iv) is the most chemically sound and logical approach among all choices for building a complex, sterically-controlled trisubstituted benzene. It is the only option that uses a blocking group to force a substitution pattern that is not achievable by direct substitution. Therefore, it is the most plausible route to the target molecule, assuming some ambiguity or error in the later steps as presented. No other option presents a viable pathway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the strategy outlined in Option C is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
