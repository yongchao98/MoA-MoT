    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the core physics:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe this population distribution.\n\n2.  **Recall the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in an excited state (N_b) to the number in a lower energy state (N_a):\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N_b, N_a are the number of atoms in states b and a.\n    *   g_b, g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the states, which we'll call ΔE.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** Let's denote the ratio N_b / N_a as R. This ratio represents the degree of \"excitation\".\n    *   For star_1, with temperature T_1:\n        R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star_2, with temperature T_2:\n        R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    The term (g_b / g_a) and ΔE are the same for both stars because we are considering the same iron atoms and the same energy transition.\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Set up the equation and solve algebraically:**\n    Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship R_1 = 2 * R_2:\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    We can cancel the (g_b / g_a) term from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Incorporate the given numerical values:**\n    The problem states the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the value of the pre-factor (ΔE / k):\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Note: The unit of the result is Kelvin. The unit of [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] is K/K² = 1/K. So, (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] has units of K * (1/K) = 1 (dimensionless), which is consistent with ln(2) being dimensionless. The value of the factor ΔE/k is 1, not 1K. Let's re-examine this.\n    My mistake was in carrying the unit. ΔE/k should not have been written as 1 K.\n    The quantity in the exponent, ΔE / (k*T), must be dimensionless.\n    (J) / ( (J/K) * K ) = Dimensionless. This is correct.\n    My derived equation is: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ].\n    Let's check units on this equation:\n    Left side: ln(2) is dimensionless.\n    Right side: The term ΔE/k has units of K. The term in brackets [(T_1-T_2)/(T_1*T_2)] has units K/K^2 = 1/K.\n    So (ΔE/k) * [...] has units K * (1/K) = dimensionless. The units are correct.\n\n    Now, we substitute the value of the term ΔE/k:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K.\n    So our equation becomes:\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    The equations in the options A, B, and C do not have this \"1 K\" factor. They are presented as a pure numerical relationship. This implies that the term (ΔE / k) is treated as a dimensionless value of 1. Let's assume the question implicitly defines the units in such a way that the equation appears as given in the options. This happens frequently in physics problems where constants are \"set to 1\".\n    With this standard convention, we have:\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]  - Incorrect denominator.\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect numerator.\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Matches our derived equation.\n    D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect form.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
