    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions\n\n*   **Point charge:** `q`\n*   **Charge's position at time t':** $\\vec{s}(t')$\n*   **Charge's velocity at time t':** $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$\n*   **Observation point:** $\\vec{r}$\n*   **Observation time:** `t`\n*   **Retarded time ($t_r$):** The time at which the electromagnetic signal (which travels at the speed of light `c`) must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. It is defined by the implicit equation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation from the problem description:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time condition becomes:\n$t - t_r = d/c$\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials for a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\n### 3. Adapting for a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard method is to perform an integration over the source time `t'` as well. The integral for the scalar potential becomes:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) dt' d^3r'$\n\nIntegrating over $\\vec{r}'$ first replaces $\\vec{r}'$ with $\\vec{s}(t')$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\n\nThis integral is of the form $\\int g(t') \\delta(f(t')) dt' = \\sum_i \\frac{g(t'_i)}{|f'(t'_i)|}$, where $t'_i$ are the roots of $f(t')=0$. Here, $f(t')=0$ gives the retarded time $t_r$.\nSo we need to evaluate the derivative of the argument of the delta function at $t' = t_r$:\n$f'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'}\\left(t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nLet $\\vec{d}(t') = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')$. Then $\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{d}(t')| = \\frac{\\vec{d}(t') \\cdot (-\\vec{v}(t'))}{|\\vec{d}(t')|} = -\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$.\nSo, $f'(t_r) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, where $\\hat{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are evaluated at $t_r$.\n\nThe integral for V evaluates to:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{|1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c|} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\n\nTo match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe derivation for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is identical, but with an extra factor of $q\\vec{v}(t_r)$ instead of just `q`. This gives:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare these results with the given options.\n\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. These are not the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential is the static one.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: **This matches our derived expressions perfectly.**\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. The scalar potential is the static one.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct derivation yields a minus sign.\n\nThus, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
