    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins (antigens) are delivered orally.\n    *   **Antigen Location:** The antigens reach the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine. This is a key site for initiating immune responses to gut pathogens.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is found in these Peyer's patches. In secondary lymphoid organs, antigen presentation leads to the clonal expansion (proliferation) of specific lymphocytes, typically within structures called germinal centers.\n    *   **Genetic Observation:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells is sequenced and shows \"high variability.\" The variable region of an antibody's heavy chain is what determines its specificity for an antigen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the biological processes listed in the options in the context of the observations.**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B-cell receptors (antibodies). It occurs in the bone marrow during B-cell development, *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already occurred in these cells and is not the process causing the *new* variability in the proliferating population.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG), which alters the antibody's effector function but does not change the antigen-binding site. The question specifies that the variability is in the *variable* heavy chain gene, not the constant region.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system, a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is not a process that generates genetic diversity in lymphocytes.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells that are proliferating in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM deliberately introduces point mutations at a high rate into the genes encoding the variable regions of antibodies. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly matches the observation of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch exhibiting \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" after antigen stimulation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the most likely process.**\n    The scenario describes an active immune response in a germinal center within a Peyer's patch. The key finding of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
