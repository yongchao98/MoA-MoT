    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC numbering starts from the right to give the ketone the lowest number (3). So the carbon chain is C1 to C6 from right to left: CH₃(1)-CH₂(2)-C(=O)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(OCH₃)(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This molecule is a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the existing stereocenter at C5.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is sp²-hybridized and prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter, the attack of the hydride is on a chiral molecule. This will lead to the formation of two products which are diastereomers. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with *excess* NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (in a certain conformation) and is therefore a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a **pair of enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** have different connectivity and will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol and the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers. Thus, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate from each other and will form a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  **Comparing Products from I and II:** The products of Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexan-3-ols (C₇H₁₆O₂), while the products of Reaction II are pentane-2,4-diols (C₅H₁₂O₂). These are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas, sizes, and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** Adding the peaks from each separable group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that have different three-dimensional shapes.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It also separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   Assuming an ideal chiral column with sufficient resolving power, all stereochemically unique compounds will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct (either constitutional isomers, diastereomers, or enantiomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will be resolved into a separate peak. Therefore, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
