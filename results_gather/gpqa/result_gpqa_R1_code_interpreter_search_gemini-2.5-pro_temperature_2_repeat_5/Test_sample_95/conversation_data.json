    "This problem requires us to calculate the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance. We will use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Formula:** The entropy (S) of a black hole is proportional to the area (A) of its event horizon. The formula is given by:\n    $S = \\frac{k_B A}{4 l_P^2}$\n    where:\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `A` is the area of the event horizon.\n    *   `l_P` is the Planck length, defined as $l_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar G}{c^3}}$.\n    Substituting the Planck length into the entropy formula and using the area of a sphere $A = 4\\pi R_s^2$ (where $R_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius), we get a more convenient form for calculation:\n    $S = \\frac{k_B (4\\pi R_s^2)}{4 (\\hbar G / c^3)} = \\frac{\\pi k_B c^3}{\\hbar G} R_s^2$\n\n2.  **Determine the Physical Size from Angular Size:** The problem provides the angular size (θ) and the distance (d) to the black hole. We can find the physical diameter (D) of the event horizon using the small-angle approximation formula, $D = d \\times \\theta_{rad}$, where the angle must be in radians. The Schwarzschild radius $R_s$ is half the diameter, $R_s = D/2$.\n\n3.  **Convert Units:** All quantities must be in standard SI units for the calculation.\n    *   Distance `d`: The distance is given as $10^{10}$ parsecs. We need to convert this to meters. (1 parsec ≈ 3.086 × 10¹⁶ meters).\n    *   Angular size `θ`: The angle is given as $10^{-17}$ degrees. We need to convert this to radians. (π radians = 180 degrees).\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will now substitute the given values and physical constants into the formulas.
