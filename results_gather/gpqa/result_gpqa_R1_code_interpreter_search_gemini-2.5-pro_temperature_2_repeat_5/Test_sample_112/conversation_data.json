    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding. This is most characteristic of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), although alcohols can also show broad peaks here.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), i.e., an alkene.\n    *   Combining these three peaks strongly suggests the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid (a molecule containing both a C=C bond and a -COOH group).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of the presence of a carboxyl group. The [COOH]⁺ fragment has a mass of approximately 45 amu (Atomic Mass Units).\n    *   Mass calculation: Carbon (≈12) + Oxygen (≈16) + Oxygen (≈16) + Hydrogen (≈1) = 45.\n\n*   **Putting it all together (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n    *   The evidence points to a molecule containing two key features: a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n    *   A double bond (C=C) or a ring counts as one degree of unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) also counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our molecule must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**: one for the C=C bond and one for the C=O bond within the carboxylic acid.\n    *   The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** This formula has two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 matches our requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a perfect fit for the data.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** This formula has two oxygen atoms.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 is not enough to account for both a C=C bond and a C=O bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H12O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom and a DoU of 1. It is inconsistent with the data for multiple reasons. This option is incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that accommodates all the spectral data—the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
