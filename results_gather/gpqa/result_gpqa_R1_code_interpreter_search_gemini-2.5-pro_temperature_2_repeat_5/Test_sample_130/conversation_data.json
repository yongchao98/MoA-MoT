    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm, and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks indicate two types of carbons. The shift at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C), and 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The structure that perfectly fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, consistent with the spectra. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Let's verify its molecular formula is consistent with the product formula.\n        *   Product formula: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n        *   Anhydride formula: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Subtracting the anhydride from the product leaves the diene's contribution: C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   Now let's determine the formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. A cyclopentadiene ring (C₅H₆) has methyl groups replacing hydrogens at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 carbon remains a CH₂ group. The formula is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄, which simplifies to C₉H₂₊₁₂ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   The molecular formulas are consistent.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   According to the *endo rule*, the kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring. In this case, the C₂=C₃ double bond from the diene becomes a double bond within the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction yields two products: a major and a minor one. The major product is the *endo* isomer, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a key cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or very weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Proton Assignments in the Product**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the product. The product (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride) has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** There are two equivalent protons on the carbons that came from maleic anhydride. These are bridgehead-type protons on a saturated ring, alpha to carbonyl groups. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Due to the symmetry and lack of adjacent protons (the bridgeheads are substituted with methyl groups), this signal should be a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **C7-Bridge Protons:** The C5 position of the original cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group. The two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* with respect to the C₂=C₃ double bond). They are not equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the aliphatic region, ~1-2 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These would give a **6H singlet** at a lower field, ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the vinylic carbons (C2 and C3). These would give a **6H singlet** at a slightly higher field than the other methyls due to the double bond, ~1.7 ppm.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Discriminating NOE**\n    Let's compare proton proximities in the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7-bridge. This places the anhydride protons (Hₐ) very close to one of the C7-bridge protons (specifically the one pointing away from the double bond, the *anti*-proton). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule from the C7-bridge. The anhydride protons (Hₐ) are now very far from both C7-bridge protons. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n    This Hₐ ↔ H(C7) interaction is the classic way to distinguish *endo* and *exo* isomers in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Options**\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a C7 proton. This distance is fixed and should be present in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the interaction between a C7-bridge proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm). This matches our analysis perfectly: this NOE should be present and strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would also be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the Hₐ ↔ H(C7) distance change is more dramatic and unambiguous.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups. Their relative distance is fixed and does not depend on the *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry.\n\n    The most definitive cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
