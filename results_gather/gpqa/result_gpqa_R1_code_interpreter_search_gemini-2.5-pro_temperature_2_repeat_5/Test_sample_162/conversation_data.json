    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Overall Process**\n\nWe are dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), in a strong monobasic acid. The overall process involves two main chemical phenomena:\n*   A neutralization reaction between the acid (H+) and the base (OH- from Fe(OH)3).\n    Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   The hydrolysis of the resulting iron(III) ion (Fe³⁺), which itself acts as a weak acid.\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) <=> [Fe(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we are trying to dissolve. This requires its molar mass.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol\n\n**3. Determine the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\nThis is the key part of the problem. There are different interpretations of \"minimum volume\", but in the context of this type of chemistry problem, a common intended simplification is to calculate the stoichiometric amount of acid needed to just neutralize the base according to the reaction equation.\n\n*   From the stoichiometry `Fe(OH)3 + 3H⁺`, we see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol\n*   The acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter (or 1000 cm³).\n*   Volume of acid = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n*   Volume of acid = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n*   Converting to cm³: Volume = 0.0280725 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in option B (28.05 cm³). This strongly suggests that this simplified stoichiometric calculation is the intended method for finding the volume.\n\n**4. Determine the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\nIf we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the Fe(OH)3 is converted to Fe³⁺ ions. The solution will contain 0.00093575 moles of Fe(III) in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n*   Total concentration of Fe(III) = Moles / Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0093575 M\n\nSince all the strong acid was consumed in the neutralization, the pH of the final solution is determined by the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion, which is a weak acid.\n*   Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) <=> [Fe(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (the acid dissociation constant, Ka) is approximately Ka1 = 6.3 x 10⁻³ (pKa1 ≈ 2.2). We need to solve for the [H⁺] in a 0.0093575 M solution of Fe³⁺.\nLet x = [H⁺] = [[Fe(OH)]²⁺]. The equation is:\n*   Ka1 = x² / (0.0093575 - x)\n*   6.3 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.0093575 - x)\n\nSolving the resulting quadratic equation (x² + 0.0063x - 5.895x10⁻⁵ = 0) gives:\n*   x = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M\n*   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nOur calculations yield:\n*   Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³\n*   pH ≈ 2.29\n\nLet's look at the options:\nA) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nB) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nC) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nD) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n\nOur calculated volume matches option B almost perfectly. Our calculated pH (2.29) is reasonably close to the pH in option B (2.04). The small discrepancy in pH is likely due to the specific value of Ka1 used for the problem, or other simplifying assumptions made by the question's author. Given the excellent match for the volume, Option B is the most plausible answer. A more complex and rigorous calculation that includes charge balance shows that a final pH of 2.04 would require about 33.4 cm³ of acid, which does not match any option. Therefore, the intended solution method is almost certainly the simplified one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\nacid_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3\nM_feoh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / M_feoh3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the stoichiometric volume of acid\n# Reaction: Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ -> Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\nmoles_h_stoichiometric = 3 * moles_feoh3\nvolume_acid_L = moles_h_stoichiometric / acid_conc\nvolume_acid_cm3 = volume_acid_L * 1000\n\n# This is the volume part of the answer.

    "This problem requires a two-step calculation. First, we determine the amount of acid needed for the chemical reaction. Second, we determine the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\n1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation.**\n    The reaction between iron(III) hydroxide, a base, and a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   *Note: Using rounded values (Fe=56, O=16, H=1) gives a molar mass of 107 g/mol, which often explains small discrepancies in multiple-choice answers.* Let's proceed with the more precise value.\n\n    Now, calculate the moles from the given mass:\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of acid required.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the acid.**\n    The acid is 0.1 M, which means it contains 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter.\n    Volume = moles / concentration = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n    To convert the volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³):\n    Volume = 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\n    This calculated volume is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option B. The minor difference is likely due to using slightly rounded atomic masses in the problem's source. This strongly suggests that B is the correct option.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\n1.  **Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n    When the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, it forms Fe³⁺ ions in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³ (or 0.1 L).\n    Concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume\n    [Fe³⁺] = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0093575 M\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion.**\n    The Fe³⁺ ion is a weak acid and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce H⁺ ions, making the solution acidic.\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium expression.**\n    The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻³. We can set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n    Ka = [H⁺][[Fe(OH)]²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n    6.3 × 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.0093575 - x)\n\n4.  **Solve for [H⁺] and calculate pH.**\n    Because Ka is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we should solve the full quadratic equation:\n    x² + (6.3 × 10⁻³)x - (5.895 × 10⁻⁵) = 0\n    Solving this equation gives x = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M.\n\n    Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ **2.29**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³\n*   pH ≈ 2.29\n\nComparing these to the given options:\n*   A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n\nOur calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume in option B (28.05 cm³). Our calculated pH (2.29) is also closest to the pH in option B (2.04). The small discrepancy in the pH value can be attributed to the use of a slightly different Ka value or other simplifying assumptions in the problem's design. Based on the near-perfect match of the volume calculation, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
