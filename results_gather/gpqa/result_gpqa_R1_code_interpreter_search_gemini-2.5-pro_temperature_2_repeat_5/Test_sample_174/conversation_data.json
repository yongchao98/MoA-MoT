    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physical System**\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. This oscillation creates radiation. This physical setup is a classic example of an **oscillating electric dipole**.\n\n*   An oscillating charge distribution where positive and negative charges move relative to each other creates a time-varying electric dipole moment.\n*   The symmetry axis being along the z-axis implies the dipole moment vector, **p**(t), is oscillating along the z-axis. We can write it as **p**(t) = p₀cos(ωt) **ẑ**, where **ẑ** is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n\n### **2. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle θ with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The well-known formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is:\n\n    dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the observation direction and the dipole axis.\n\n*   The function f(λ, θ) mentioned in the problem is this radiated power per unit solid angle. So, we have:\n    f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)\n\n*   The problem states that the *maximum* power radiated is A. This maximum occurs when the sin²(θ) term is at its maximum value. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which happens when θ = 90° (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    A = f_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1\n\n*   We need to find the fraction of A that is radiated at an angle θ = 30°. Let's calculate the power at this angle:\n    f(at 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)\n\n*   The fraction is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power A:\n    Fraction = [f(at 30°)] / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = sin²(30°) / 1\n\n*   Now, we calculate the value of sin²(30°).\n    sin(30°) = 1/2\n    sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nSo, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n\n### **3. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also dependent on the frequency (or wavelength) of the oscillation. From classical electrodynamics (using the Larmor formula for an accelerating charge), the total power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration. For a simple harmonic oscillation, acceleration is proportional to the square of the angular frequency (a ∝ ω²x). This leads to the radiated power being proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n\n    P ∝ ω⁴\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n\n    P ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThe power per unit solid angle, f(λ, θ), has the same wavelength dependence as the total power.\n\n    f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁴\n\nThis λ⁻⁴ dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also the reason for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering (which causes the sky to be blue).\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power A at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the function f, in terms of its dependence on wavelength λ, is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\nA) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nB) 1/4, λ⁻³\nC) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nD) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\nOur derived results match option C perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
