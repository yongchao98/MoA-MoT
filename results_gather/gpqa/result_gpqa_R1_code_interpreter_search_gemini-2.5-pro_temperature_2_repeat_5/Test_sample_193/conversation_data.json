    "The user wants to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3.\n\n1.  **Define the System and States**:\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n    Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible states (microstates) for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy of the System**:\n    The energy E of the system for a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function**:\n    The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n    Z = sum_states e^(-βE)\n    Since some states might have the same energy, we can group them by their energy levels. If g(E) is the degeneracy (number of states) for an energy level E, the partition function can be written as:\n    Z = sum_E g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State**:\n    Let's list all 8 possible states and calculate their corresponding energies.\n\n    *   **State 1**: All spins up (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n        E1 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2**: One spin down, two spins up. There are three such states:\n        *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three states have the same energy E = J.\n\n    *   **State 3**: Two spins down, one spin up. There are three such states:\n        *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three of these states also have the same energy E = J.\n\n    *   **State 4**: All spins down (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n        E4 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n5.  **Group States by Energy and Degeneracy**:\n    From the calculations above, we have two distinct energy levels:\n    *   Energy level E_1 = -3J. The states corresponding to this energy are (+++) and (---). So, the degeneracy g1 is 2.\n    *   Energy level E_2 = J. All the other 6 states have this energy. So, the degeneracy g2 is 6.\n    The total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have considered all possible states.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z**:\n    Now, we can use the formula Z = g1*e^(-βE1) + g2*e^(-βE2).\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options**:\n    The calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n    B) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n    C) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\n    D) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\n    The result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
