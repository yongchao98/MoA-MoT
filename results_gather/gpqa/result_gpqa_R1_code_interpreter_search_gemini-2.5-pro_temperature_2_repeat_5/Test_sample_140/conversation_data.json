    "This is a classic problem involving the benzyne mechanism in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction to determine the number of possible products.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine (Br) at position C1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions: C6 (bearing a hydrogen, H) and C2 (bearing a deuterium, D). This leads to two competing pathways for the initial elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a **3-deuteriobenzyne** intermediate. The deuterium atom remains on the ring at position C2.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower but still occurs.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH2⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ attacks C1. The resulting carbanion is at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups are adjacent.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ attacks C6. The resulting carbanion is at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups have a meta relationship.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Summary of Products**\nBy considering both pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
