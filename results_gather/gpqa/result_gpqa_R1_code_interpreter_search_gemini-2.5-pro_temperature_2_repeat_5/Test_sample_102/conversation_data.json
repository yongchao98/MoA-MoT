    "This question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents:\n1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n-   -COCH3 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n-   -Br is a deactivating, ortho,para-directing group.\n-   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring often involves using a powerful directing group that is later removed or modified. A common strategy is to use an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong ortho,para-director, and then remove it at the end of the synthesis via a Sandmeyer-type reaction (diazotization followed by reduction). The presence of steps involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of the diazonium group with -H) in options A, B, and C suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene:** This is the standard nitration of benzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\nii) **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong ortho,para-director.\niii) **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** This step represents Friedel-Crafts acylation. Direct acylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex. However, it is possible to achieve this transformation. A common way is N-acylation to form acetanilide, followed by a Fries rearrangement to yield ortho- and para-aminoacetophenone. The para-isomer is usually the major product. Let's assume this step yields **p-aminoacetophenone** [1-(4-aminophenyl)ethan-1-one].\niv) **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> ?** Bromination. We now have two directing groups: -NH2 (at position 4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at position 1, m-director).\n    -   The -NH2 group directs bromination to its ortho positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The -COCH3 group directs bromination to its meta positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The groups are cooperative, so bromination will occur with high yield at position 3 (or 5, which is equivalent). The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\nv) **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. We now have three directing groups: -COCH3 (at 1, meta), -Br (at 3, o,p), and -NH2 (at 4, strong o,p).\n    -   -NH2 at C-4 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -COCH3 at C-1 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -Br at C-3 directs to C-2 and C-6.\n    -   The powerful activating -NH2 group and the meta-directing -COCH3 group both strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. Their influence overrides the weaker directing effect of bromine. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\nvi) **Diazotization --(NaNO2/HCl)-->** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\nvii) **Deamination --(H3PO2)-->** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This removes the amino group that was used to direct the substitutions.\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This synthetic pathway is logical and all steps contribute to the formation of the desired product in high yield.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** (-COCH3 is a m-director).\nii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** (-COCH3 directs Br to the meta position).\niii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. The ring has a -COCH3 group (meta-director) and a -Br group (o,p-director). The -Br group is a stronger director in terms of position, so nitration would primarily occur at positions 4 and 6 (ortho/para to bromine), not position 5 (meta to both). This step would not give the desired precursor in high yield. The rest of the sequence is nonsensical as it involves reducing the nitro group only to nitrate the ring again. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** (-Br is an o,p-director).\nii) **Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\niii) **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction is extremely slow and low-yielding. Furthermore, both -Br and -NO2 direct the incoming acetyl group to position 2 (ortho to Br, meta to NO2). This would form 1-(2-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone, where the acetyl and bromo groups are ortho, not meta as required in the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni-iv) **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene:** These steps just nitrate benzene and then remove the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Option A outlines a viable and strategic synthesis route that uses an amino group as a temporary directing group to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern required.\n\n<<<A>>>"
