    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the piece of glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S):** The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` relative to the observer. Let's denote this by `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the glass frame (S'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. In the frame of the glass (S'), the light is moving through it. Therefore, the velocity of light relative to the glass is `u' = c/n`. The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`. So, `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass moves, this velocity is positive.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory frame (S):** This is the quantity we need to find. Let's call it `u`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Law:**\n    Since the problem involves velocities that can be close to the speed of light, we must use the formula for relativistic velocity addition, not the classical Galilean addition (`u = v + u'`). The Einstein velocity addition formula for velocities `v` and `u'` in the same direction is:\n\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `v` = `v` (velocity of the glass)\n    *   `u'` = `1/n` (velocity of light in the glass)\n    *   `c` = `1` (speed of light in vacuum)\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * (1/n)) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n    `u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    Rearranging the terms in the numerator gives:\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated speed `u` relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. Let's compare this with the provided options:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
