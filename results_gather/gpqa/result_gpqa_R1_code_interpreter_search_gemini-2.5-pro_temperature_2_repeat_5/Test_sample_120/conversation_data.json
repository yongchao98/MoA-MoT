    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` core describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The `7-oxa` designation indicates that one atom of the three-membered ring is an oxygen, making this an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`.\n\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate (a Gilman reagent). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe problem describes the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate. The key rules for this reaction are:\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and prefer to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide in an Sₙ2-like manner.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The nucleophilic attack occurs from the backside of the C-O bond being broken, resulting in an *inversion of configuration* at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C2 of the ring, C6 of the ring, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C1 of the ring, C5 of the ring, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nComparing the two, the tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\nThis immediately allows us to eliminate options that would result from an attack at C1. An attack at C1 (which already has a methyl group) would lead to a product with a gem-dimethyl group (two methyls on the same carbon). The product options B and D, `(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and `(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, both feature a 2,2-dimethyl arrangement. This is inconsistent with an attack at the less hindered C6.\n**Thus, we can eliminate options B and D.**\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nWe are left to choose between option A and option C. The difference between them is the stereochemistry at the C2 position in the product.\n\n*   The attack occurs at **C6** of the starting material.\n*   The original configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration**.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at the carbon atom C6 will become **(R)** in the product.\n\n**5. Map the Reactant Atoms to the Product Structure**\n\nWe need to determine the IUPAC name of the final alcohol product.\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after protonation (workup), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the highest priority functional group (the -OH group) is numbered C1. So, the original C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   To assign the lowest possible locants to the other substituents, we number the ring towards the newly added methyl group. The attacked carbon, original C6, is adjacent to the original C1. Thus, the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n*   So, the stereocenter resulting from the attack at C6 is the C2 stereocenter in the product.\n\nCombining our findings:\n*   The stereocenter at the new C2 position corresponds to the original C6.\n*   Original C6 had an (S) configuration.\n*   The reaction causes inversion to an (R) configuration.\n*   Therefore, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position C2.\n\n**6. Compare with Remaining Options**\n\nLet's look at the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has a (2R) configuration.\n*   **C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has a (2S) configuration.\n\nOur analysis concludes that the product must be **(2R)**. This matches option A.\n\n**Sanity Check of Other Stereocenters:**\n*   The chiral centers at C3 and C4 of the reactant are not involved in the reaction. Their absolute configurations will be retained. In the product, these correspond to C5 and C4, respectively. So, the product should be (4R, 5R). Both A and C have this.\n*   The chiral center at C1 is where the C-O bond breaks, but no bonds *to the chiral center itself* are broken (the break is between O and C6). Its configuration is retained. The reactant is (1R), so the product should be (1R). Both A and C have this.\n\nThe deciding factor is the stereochemistry at C2, which must be (R) due to the inversion of the (S) configuration at C6.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of a methyl group at the less hindered C6 of the epoxide, with inversion of stereochemistry. This leads to the formation of (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
