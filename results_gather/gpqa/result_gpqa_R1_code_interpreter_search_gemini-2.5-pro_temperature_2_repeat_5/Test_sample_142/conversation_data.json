    "This problem requires us to determine the starting material (A) for one Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement and the product (B) for another. We will analyze each reaction separately.\n\n### Part 1: Finding Starting Material A\n\nThe reaction is:\nA + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nThis is a \"retrosynthesis\" problem where we deduce the starting material from the product. The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement converts a 1,2-diol (a pinacol) into a ketone or aldehyde (a pinacolone). The reaction involves the formation of a carbocation followed by a 1,2-migration of a group (hydride, alkyl, or aryl).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone on a six-membered ring. The C=O group is at position 1, and two p-tolyl groups are on the adjacent carbon, position 2.\n\n2.  **Consider the Mechanism:** The rearrangement often involves a change in the carbon skeleton, such as ring expansion or contraction. The product is a six-membered ring (cyclohexanone). Let's consider the possibility that the starting material had a five-membered ring which expanded.\n    *   Options B and C propose a starting material with a cyclopentane ring: `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`.\n    *   Let's test this proposed starting material. Its structure consists of a cyclopentane ring with an -OH group at C1. Also attached to C1 is a `-C(OH)(p-tolyl)₂` group. This is a 1,2-diol, where the two carbons bearing the -OH groups are C1 of the ring and the adjacent exocyclic carbon (let's call it Cα).\n\n3.  **Trace the Forward Reaction from the Proposed Starting Material:**\n    *   **Step 1: Protonation and Carbocation Formation.** There are two tertiary -OH groups. One on the cyclopentane ring (C1) and one on the exocyclic carbon (Cα). The -OH on Cα will be preferentially protonated because its departure as H₂O forms a diarylmethyl cation, `-(p-Tol)₂C⁺`, which is highly stabilized by resonance with the two aryl rings. This carbocation is significantly more stable than the tertiary carbocation that would form on the ring at C1.\n    *   **Intermediate Carbocation:** `(cyclopentyl)-C1(OH)-Cα⁺(p-Tol)₂`\n    *   **Step 2: 1,2-Migration (Ring Expansion).** A group from the adjacent carbon (C1 of the ring) must migrate to the positively charged Cα. The groups on C1 are the C-C bonds of the ring. Migration of one of these bonds will lead to ring expansion from a 5-membered ring to a 6-membered ring.\n        *   Let the cyclopentane ring atoms be C1-C2-C3-C4-C5. The bond between C1 and C2 (or C1 and C5) migrates. Let's say the C1-C2 bond breaks, and a new bond forms between C2 and Cα.\n        *   The original C1 atom, having lost a bond and its electrons, now becomes the new carbocation center.\n    *   **Step 3: Ketone Formation.** The new six-membered ring now contains `...-Cα(p-Tol)₂-C2-...-C5-C1(+)(OH)-...`. The carbocation at C1 is adjacent to the -OH group. This rearranges via deprotonation to form a stable ketone at C1.\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** The ketone group (C=O) is at the C1 position. The adjacent carbon in the newly formed ring is Cα, which carries the two p-tolyl groups. Therefore, the product is indeed **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The starting material must be **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n### Part 2: Finding Product B\n\nThe reaction is:\nmethyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   \"methyl ... butanoate\" indicates a 4-carbon ester: `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The substituents are \"2,3-dihydroxy\" and \"2-(p-tolyl)\".\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃–CH(OH)–C(p-Tol)(OH)–COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's number the carbons: `C4H₃–C3H(OH)–C2(p-Tol)(OH)–C1(=O)OCH₃`.\n\n2.  **Trace the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   **Step 1: Protonation and Carbocation Formation.** We need to decide which -OH group leaves. The -OH is on C3 (a secondary carbon) and C2 (a tertiary carbon).\n        *   Losing the -OH from C3 creates a secondary carbocation at C3.\n        *   Losing the -OH from C2 creates a tertiary carbocation at C2, which is also benzylic (stabilized by the adjacent p-tolyl group). This tertiary benzylic carbocation is much more stable.\n        *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds by protonating the -OH at C2 and its departure as H₂O.\n    *   **Intermediate Carbocation:** `CH₃–C3H(OH)–C2⁺(p-Tol)–C1(=O)OCH₃`\n    *   **Step 2: 1,2-Migration.** A group from the adjacent carbon (C3) must migrate to the carbocation at C2. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom (H) and a methyl group (CH₃). The migratory aptitude order is H > alkyl. Therefore, a hydride shift (migration of H⁻) occurs.\n    *   **Step 3: Ketone Formation.** After the hydride shift from C3 to C2, the carbocation is now on C3, stabilized by the adjacent -OH group: `CH₃–C3⁺(OH)–C2H(p-Tol)–C1(=O)OCH₃`. This deprotonates to form a stable ketone at C3.\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** `CH₃–C3(=O)–C2H(p-Tol)–C1(=O)OCH₃`\n\n3.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The parent chain is a methyl butanoate.\n    *   There is a ketone (oxo) group at position 3.\n    *   There is a p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    *   The name is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Product B is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**. This eliminates option B (which names a propanoate) and D.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting Material A: 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol\n*   Product B: methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n\nCombining these results, we find that option C matches both conclusions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
