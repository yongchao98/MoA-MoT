    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = (1/2) * k * r^2 + (3/2) * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is beneficial to express it in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). This often helps in separating the variables.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\n    x = r * cos(θ)\n    y = r * sin(θ)\n    From which we can also write:\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n    r * cos(θ) = x\n\n    Now substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2) * k * (x^2 + y^2) + (3/2) * k * (r * cos(θ))^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2) * k * (x^2 + y^2) + (3/2) * k * x^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = [(1/2) * k * x^2 + (3/2) * k * x^2] + (1/2) * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = [(1/2 + 3/2) * k] * x^2 + (1/2) * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + (1/2) * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + (1/2) * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Recognize the Form of the Potential:**\n    The simplified potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    This is the potential of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. We can identify the two 1D harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2 = (1/2) * (4k) * x^2\n    V_y(y) = (1/2) * k * y^2\n    The standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator potential is V(q) = (1/2) * k_eff * q^2. By comparing, we can find the effective spring constants for the motion in the x and y directions:\n    k_x = 4k\n    k_y = k\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    Since the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is separable. The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with mass m and spring constant k_eff are given by:\n    E_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Frequencies and Energies:**\n    Let's find the angular frequencies for our two oscillators:\n    For the x-direction:\n    ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are (with quantum number n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...):\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    For the y-direction:\n    ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are (with quantum number n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...):\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    Now, sum the energies E_x and E_y to find the total energy E:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    Let's factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    Combine the constant terms inside the bracket:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m). Let's compare this with the options:\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our result matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
