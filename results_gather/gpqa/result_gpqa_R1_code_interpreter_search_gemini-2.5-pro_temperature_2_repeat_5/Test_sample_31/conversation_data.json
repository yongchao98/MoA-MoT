    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus \"X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\"\n    *   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it always has 3 protons.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons. Therefore, A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n    *   The nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy Formula**\n    *   The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n        $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n    *   Where:\n        *   $m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy of the particle.\n        *   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    *   The speed of the nucleus is given as $v = 0.96c$.\n    *   This means the ratio $v/c = 0.96$.\n    *   Now, we calculate $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.571428$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Energy ($m_0 c^2$)**\n    *   For this type of physics problem, the mass of the nucleus ($m_0$) can be approximated in a few ways. We must determine which approximation leads to one of the given answers.\n        *   **Method 1: Precise Nuclear Mass.** The actual mass of a $^6$Li nucleus is about 6.0135 u. This gives a rest energy of $E_0 \\approx 5601.5$ MeV. This leads to a total energy of $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5601.5 \\approx 20005$ MeV = 20.005 GeV. This does not match any option well.\n        *   **Method 2: Mass Number x Proton Mass.** Approximating the nucleus mass as $A \\times m_p$ where $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV. This gives $E_0 = 6 \\times 938.27 \\approx 5629.6$ MeV. The total energy becomes $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5629.6 \\approx 20106$ MeV = 20.106 GeV. This is close to option D, but not a precise match.\n        *   **Method 3: Mass Number x Neutron Mass.** Approximating the nucleus mass as $A \\times m_n$ where $m_n c^2 \\approx 939.56$ MeV. This is a plausible approximation, especially in a nucleus with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test this method.\n\n    *   Using the approximation $m_0 \\approx A \\times m_n$:\n        $E_0 = 6 \\times (m_n c^2)$\n        Using the standard value for the neutron rest energy, $m_n c^2 \\approx 939.565$ MeV.\n        $E_0 = 6 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV} = 5637.39 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n    *   Now we multiply the rest energy by the Lorentz factor:\n        $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n        $E \\approx 3.571428 \\times 5637.39 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20133.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n6.  **Convert to GeV**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the result:\n        $E = \\frac{20133.5 \\text{ MeV}}{1000 \\text{ MeV/GeV}} = 20.1335 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**\n    *   Our calculated value is 20.1335 GeV.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 18.475 GeV\n        B) 23.069 GeV\n        C) 21.419 GeV\n        D) 20.132 GeV\n    *   The calculated value of 20.1335 GeV is extremely close to option D, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (less than 0.01%) is due to the exact values of the physical constants used by the source of the problem.\n\nWe can confirm this with a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Speed of the nucleus\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Mass number of the nucleus (Li-6)\nA = 6\n\n# Rest energy of a neutron in MeV (CODATA 2018 value)\nm_n_c2_MeV = 939.56542052\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Calculate the rest energy of the nucleus using the A * m_n approximation\nE0_MeV = A * m_n_c2_MeV\n\n# Calculate the total relativistic energy in MeV\nE_MeV = gamma * E0_MeV\n\n# Convert the total energy to GeV and format to the required precision\nE_GeV = E_MeV / 1000\n\nprint(f\"{E_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n20.1335\n\nThe calculation confirms that 20.1335 GeV is the result, which aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning for the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Particle's Properties:**\n    *   The problem describes a nucleus of Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium's atomic number (number of protons) is Z = 3.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n    *   The nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Determine the Required Formula:**\n    *   The problem involves a particle moving at a relativistic speed ($v = 0.96c$).\n    *   The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Given $v = 0.96c$, the ratio $v/c$ is 0.96.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Energy ($m_0 c^2$):**\n    *   To find an answer that matches the given options, a common approximation in such problems is to estimate the nucleus's mass by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon. Given that the result of the python script is very close to option D, the approximation used is based on the neutron's rest mass.\n    *   The rest energy of a single neutron is approximately $m_n c^2 \\approx 939.565$ MeV.\n    *   The approximate rest energy of the $^6$Li nucleus is $E_0 = A \\times (m_n c^2) = 6 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 5637.39 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n    *   Multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy: $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$.\n    *   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5637.39 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20133.5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Convert to GeV and Compare:**\n    *   Convert the energy from MeV to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV): $E \\approx 20.1335$ GeV.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        *   A) 18.475 GeV\n        *   B) 23.069 GeV\n        *   C) 21.419 GeV\n        *   D) 20.132 GeV\n    *   The calculated value of 20.1335 GeV is extremely close to 20.132 GeV. The minor difference is likely due to the precise values of the physical constants used by the source of the problem versus those used in the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
