    "This question involves a classic synthetic route in organic chemistry known as the Stork enamine alkylation. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to determine the reagents (A) and the final product (B).\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material:**\n\n*   The starting material is **(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium**. This is an **iminium salt**.\n*   It is formed from the condensation of **pentan-2-one** (CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3) and **N-methylethanamine** (or ethylmethylamine, CH3-NH-CH2CH3).\n*   The structure of the iminium cation is [CH3-C(=N+(CH3)(CH2CH3))-CH2CH2CH3]. The nitrogen atom is positively charged. The carbons alpha to the C=N double bond are the methyl group (C1) and the methylene group of the propyl chain (C3).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Sequence (Reagents A):**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct steps. A correct sequence is crucial for the success of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Step (i): Formation of the Enamine.**\n    *   Reagent: **LDA (Lithium Diisopropylamide)** in **DME (Dimethoxyethane)**.\n    *   LDA is a very strong, non-nucleophilic, and sterically bulky base. Its role is to abstract an acidic proton from a carbon atom alpha to the C=N+ group to form an enamine.\n    *   The iminium salt has two sets of alpha-protons: on the C1-methyl group and the C3-methylene group.\n    *   Because LDA is bulky, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position. In this case, it will deprotonate the C1-methyl group. This is called kinetic control.\n    *   Iminium Salt: [CH3-C(=N+(Et)(Me))-CH2CH2CH3]\n    *   Deprotonation at C1 gives the kinetic enamine: **H2C=C(N(Et)(Me))-CH2CH2CH3**.\n\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation of the Enamine.**\n    *   Reagent: **CH3CH2I (Iodoethane)**.\n    *   The enamine is nucleophilic at the alpha-carbon (the C1 carbon that was deprotonated). The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom pushes electron density into the C=C double bond, making the terminal CH2 group a strong nucleophile.\n    *   This nucleophilic carbon attacks the electrophilic carbon of iodoethane, displacing the iodide ion. This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction.\n    *   [H2C=C(N(Et)(Me))-CH2CH2CH3] + CH3CH2-I â†’ [**CH3CH2**-CH2-C(=N+(Et)(Me))-CH2CH2CH3] + I-\n    *   A new, larger iminium salt is formed. An ethyl group (CH3CH2-) has been added to the C1 carbon of the original pentanone skeleton.\n\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis of the Iminium Salt.**\n    *   Reagent: **H3O+ (acidic water)**.\n    *   This final step is an aqueous workup. Water attacks the carbon of the C=N+ bond, and subsequent proton transfers lead to the cleavage of the C=N bond.\n    *   The iminium salt is hydrolyzed back to a ketone, and the secondary amine is released as its ammonium salt.\n    *   [CH3CH2-CH2-C(=N+(Et)(Me))-CH2CH2CH3] + H2O --(H+)--> **CH3CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3** + [H2N+(Et)(Me)]\n\n**3. Identify the Final Product (B):**\n\n*   The ketone produced is CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.\n*   This molecule has a seven-carbon chain with the carbonyl group at the 4th position.\n*   Its name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   **A)** This option suggests the product is pentan-2-one, the starting ketone, which is incorrect. The point of the reaction is to alkylate the ketone.\n*   **B)** This option correctly identifies the reagent sequence as a three-step process: (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+. It also correctly identifies the final product (B) as **heptan-4-one**. This is the correct choice.\n*   **C)** This option has the correct product but lists the reagents in an incorrect sequence. Mixing DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+ in a single step is not a valid synthetic procedure. The hydrolysis agent (H3O+) would react with and destroy the enamine before it could be alkylated.\n*   **D)** This option has both an incorrect reagent sequence and an incorrect product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct sequence of reagents (A) is (i) LDA in DME, followed by (ii) CH3CH2I, and finally (iii) H3O+ workup. The final product (B) of this sequence is heptan-4-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
