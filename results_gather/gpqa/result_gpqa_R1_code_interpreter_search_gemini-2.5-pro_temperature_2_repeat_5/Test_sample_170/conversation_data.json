    "This problem requires arranging several substituted benzenes in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo derivative during an electrophilic substitution reaction. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. We need to classify the substituents and then analyze the factors that influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a **deactivating, ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly **deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substituents**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer. The amount of para product is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivator directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in less para product.\n\nThe deactivating strength of the meta-directors is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the ethyl group is weakly electron-donating compared to the acidic proton of the -COOH group.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nIn terms of substance numbers, this is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing substituents**\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5 (1 and 5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the para/ortho ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    Order: C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5\n    In terms of numbers: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing -Cl with the alkyl groups (3 vs. 1 and 5):** The chloro group is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. Halogens have a unique effect: their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates all ring positions, but the effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions. Their electron-donating resonance effect (+R) activates the ortho and para positions. The combination of these effects leads to a strong preference for para substitution over ortho substitution. Consequently, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation, typically higher than that from simple alkylbenzenes.\n    Thus, the para yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for ethylbenzene and toluene.\n    Order: C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n    In terms of numbers: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the ordering for all ortho, para-directors:\nC6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\nIn terms of numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine all substances**\n\nThe meta-directing groups produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer, followed by the ortho, para-directing groups. We combine the two ordered lists from the previous steps.\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
