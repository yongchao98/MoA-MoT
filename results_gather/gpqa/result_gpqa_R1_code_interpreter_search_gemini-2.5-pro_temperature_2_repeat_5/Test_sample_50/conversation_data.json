    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded, which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (`V = 0`).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common misconception is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct way is to consider that the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the interaction between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be found by calculating half the potential energy of `q` in the field of its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge on the sphere is created by the field of `q` itself; the system's energy is built up gradually.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is `V_image`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_image` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the other charges (which are represented by the image charge).\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)   (Correct)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)       (Incorrect, misses 1/2 and has 'd' in numerator)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect, has 'd' in numerator and '+' in denominator)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
