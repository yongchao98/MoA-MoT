    "*   **Analysis of the Molecules**\n\n    To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group is characterized by having a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n    1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-OCH(CH3)2). The B and the three O atoms form a trigonal planar B(O)3 core.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. The molecule's symmetry depends on the conformation of the three isopropyl groups, which can rotate around the B-O bonds.\n        *   A specific, stable conformation exists where the molecule possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is coincident with the B(O)3 plane. In this conformation, for each isopropyl group, the central C-H bond lies within the σh plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane.\n        *   This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks vertical mirror planes and C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Therefore, triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. This is a classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n\n    2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, specifically 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that pass through the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n    3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the systematic name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar. The C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Additionally, there are three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule, and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Because it has C3, σh, C2 (perpendicular), and σv elements, the point group is **D3h**. While a D3h molecule contains the elements of C3h symmetry, its overall point group is higher.\n\n    4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a larger analog of mellitic trianhydride, based on a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar, highly symmetric molecule (D3h). The addition of three symmetric anhydride groups maintains the high symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this large molecule is expected to be planar. It will possess a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), perpendicular C2 axes, and vertical mirror planes. Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups:\n    *   A: D3h\n    *   B: C3h (in a stable conformation)\n    *   C: C3v\n    *   D: D3h\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Typically, this refers to the molecule whose point group is C3h. Only triisopropyl borate fits this description. The molecules with D3h symmetry have a higher level of symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
