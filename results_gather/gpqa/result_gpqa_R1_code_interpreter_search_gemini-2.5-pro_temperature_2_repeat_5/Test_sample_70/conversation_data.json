    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, denoted as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is given by:\n        `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n        where:\n        *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n        *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n        *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n        *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n        `P² ∝ a³`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    *   We need to calculate the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    *   `T_eq4 = T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))`\n    *   `T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the *same albedo*, so `A_4 = A_2`.\n    *   When we form the ratio, many terms will cancel out: `T_star`, `(1-A)^(1/4)`, `R_star`, and `2`.\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(1 / a_4)] / [sqrt(1 / a_2)]`\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n4.  **Relate the Orbital Distance Ratio (a₂/a₄) to the Period Ratio (P₂/P₄):**\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law (`P² ∝ a³`), we can write a ratio for Planet 2 and Planet 4:\n        `(P₂ / P₄)² = (a₂ / a₄)³`\n    *   To find `a₂ / a₄`, we take the cube root of both sides:\n        `a₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Period Relation into the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   We found `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₄)`.\n    *   Substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₄`:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) )`\n    *   Simplify the exponent: `sqrt(x) = x^(1/2)`.\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) )^(1/2) = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)`\n    *   This elegant result shows the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n6.  **Use the Given Period Ratios and Calculate:**\n    *   The problem provides the period ratios: `P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n    *   From this, we can take the ratio `P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5`.\n    *   Now, substitute this value into our final formula:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    *   Let's use a Python script to compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2 to P4\np2_p4_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio\ntemp_ratio = p2_p4_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.8299. This value is closest to 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.83 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq), and its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`) is given by `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n\nThe relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its semi-major axis (`a`) is described by Kepler's Third Law, which for planets around the same star is `P² ∝ a³`. This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period: `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n\nNow, we can combine these two relationships to find the relationship between temperature and period:\nSince `T_eq ∝ 1/√a` and `a ∝ P^(2/3)`, we have `√a ∝ (P^(2/3))^(1/2) = P^(1/3)`.\nTherefore, `T_eq ∝ 1/P^(1/3)`.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the proportionality we just derived:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1/P_4^(1/3)) / (1/P_2^(1/3)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as `P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n`P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe value is calculated as:\n`(2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.5714^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated ratio is closest to 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
