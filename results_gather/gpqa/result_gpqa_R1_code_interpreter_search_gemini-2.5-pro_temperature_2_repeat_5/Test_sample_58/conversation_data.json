    "*   **1. Calculate moles of each species:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of HCl = 0.4 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.08 mol.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n        *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-), moles of OH- = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **2. Neutralization Reactions:**\n    *   The strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2) first.\n        *   Initial moles H+ = 0.08 mol\n        *   Initial moles OH- = 0.18 mol\n        *   Reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n        *   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.10 mol\n        *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n        *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n        *   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the weak acid will be consumed.\n        *   Excess moles of OH- = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **3. Determine the final state of the solution:**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess strong base (OH-). The presence of this strong base will dictate the pH, making the contribution from the hydrolysis of the conjugate base (CH3COO-) negligible.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\n*   **4.

    "*   **1. Initial Moles Calculation**\n    *   We first calculate the number of moles of each acid and base present in the initial solutions.\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n    *   **Moles of HCl (a strong acid):**\n        *   HCl completely dissociates in water (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), so moles of H⁺ = moles of HCl.\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n        *   Ba(OH)2 completely dissociates in water to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **2. Neutralization Reactions**\n    *   The strong base (OH⁻) will react with the available acids. The neutralization reaction occurs in a stepwise manner, with the strong acid reacting first.\n    *   **Step 2a: Reaction of Strong Base with Strong Acid**\n        *   We have 0.18 mol of OH⁻ and 0.08 mol of H⁺ from HCl. The reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n        *   Since there is more OH⁻ than H⁺, all the strong acid will be neutralized.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Initial OH⁻ - Moles of H⁺ from HCl\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n    *   **Step 2b: Reaction of Remaining Strong Base with Weak Acid**\n        *   Now, the remaining 0.10 mol of OH⁻ will react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH. The reaction is CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n        *   We have 0.10 mol of OH⁻ and 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH.\n        *   The weak acid is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n        *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Moles of OH⁻ - Moles of CH₃COOH\n        *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **3. Final pH Calculation**\n    *   After all the reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions.\n    *   **Step 3a: Calculate Total Volume**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   **Step 3b: Calculate [OH⁻] Concentration**\n        *   [OH⁻] = Excess moles of OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Step 3c: Calculate pOH and pH**\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n        *   pH + pOH = 14\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
