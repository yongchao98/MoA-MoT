    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We start with an uncharged, electrically neutral spherical conductor. This means the total charge of the conductor is zero.\n2.  **Placing a Charge Inside the Cavity:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n3.  **Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge `-q` distributes itself on the inner surface in a way that cancels the electric field from `+q` for all points within the conductor material.\n4.  **Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. We have just established that a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the free electrons within the conductor. To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere. Since these are conductors, charges are free to move. This excess positive charge will repel itself and move as far apart as possible, which means it will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`. In the absence of any other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface. This is because a uniform distribution on a sphere is the configuration of minimum electrostatic potential energy.\n6.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the outside region from the electric fields of any charges inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor, due to the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, is exactly zero.\n7.  **Calculating the Field Outside:** Therefore, the electric field at point P (which is outside the conductor) is produced *solely* by the charge `+q` that is distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is given by the same formula as the electric field from a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere (this is known as the Shell Theorem).\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of the point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` at O.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{(distance)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe parameters `r` (radius of the cavity), `s` (distance between centers), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `Î¸` (angle) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
