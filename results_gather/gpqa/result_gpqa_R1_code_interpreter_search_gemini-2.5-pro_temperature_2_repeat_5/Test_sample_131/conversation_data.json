    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Data from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of the two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most restrictive pieces of information are that **all observed signals are singlets** and the specific integration patterns.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options provided.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. In principle, they should produce **four separate singlets**, each integrating to 3H. However, accidental equivalence (where signals overlap by chance) is very common for similar methyl groups, so we might observe fewer than four signals. Based on spectral databases (like SDBS), it often shows three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing an AB quartet or a pair of doublets, **not a singlet**. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3CH2):** The protons of the ethyl group will show spin-spin coupling. The CH2 group will be a **quartet**, and the CH3 group will be a **triplet**. These are not singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\n*   Options containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (B and D) are incorrect because this compound would show multiplets (not singlets) in the aromatic region.\n*   The option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene** (A) is incorrect because this compound would show a quartet and a triplet (not singlets) in the alkyl region.\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only **Option C** as the possible answer.\n\n**4. Verify Option C**\n\nLet's confirm if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** matches the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1 mole of 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1 mole of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Total aromatic protons = 2H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 2H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 4H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means each signal must integrate to 2H.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (2H):** The single singlet from the two equivalent protons of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   **Signal 2 (2H):** The two different 1H protons from 1,2,3,5-TMB must be *accidentally equivalent* (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single singlet with an integration of 1H + 1H = 2H.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. For a total of 24 protons, this corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (12H):** The single singlet from the four equivalent methyl groups of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   The remaining signals (6H and 6H) must come from the 12 protons of the four methyl groups in 1,2,3,5-TMB. This means the four non-equivalent 3H singlets must pair up due to accidental equivalence.\n        *   **Signal 2 (6H):** Two of the 3H methyl singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have the same chemical shift.\n        *   **Signal 3 (6H):** The other two 3H methyl singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have the same chemical shift (but different from Signal 2).\n    *   This combination also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that fits the spectral data, allowing for plausible accidental chemical shift equivalences, is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
