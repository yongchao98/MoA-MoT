    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Aperture Shape in the Limit**\n\n*   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length, 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides.\n*   We need to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n*   For a regular N-gon, the relationship between the radius of its circumscribed circle (R) and the apothem (a) is given by `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n*   As N approaches infinity, the term `π/N` approaches 0.\n*   The cosine of an angle approaching 0 is `cos(0) = 1`.\n*   Therefore, in the limit as N -> ∞, the apothem `a` becomes equal to the radius `R`.\n*   An N-sided regular polygon with an infinite number of sides is a circle.\n*   So, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**2. Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Airy Pattern)**\n\n*   The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field region is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n*   The intensity distribution is described by a Bessel function. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, `J₁(x)`.\n*   The condition for an intensity minimum is given by:\n    `k * a * sin(θ) = zᵢ`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the wavenumber, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   `zᵢ` are the non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The index `i=1` corresponds to the first minimum, `i=2` to the second, and so on.\n\n**3. Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n\n*   The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Substituting this and the expression for `k` into the condition for minima:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θᵢ = zᵢ`\n*   Solving for the angular position of the i-th minimum, `θᵢ`:\n    `θᵢ = zᵢ * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n**4. Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function**\n\n*   We need the values for the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`. These are standard mathematical values.\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**5. Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\n\n*   **First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   **Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is the separation between them, `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [z₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [z₁ * λ / (2π * a)]`\n*   `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n*   Plugging in the values for `z₁` and `z₂`:\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n*   Now, we compute the numerical coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J_1(x)\nz1 = 3.831706\nz2 = 7.015587\n\n# The angular distance is Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ/a)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5067571337965935\n</execute_output>\n*   The calculation gives a coefficient of approximately 0.5067.\n\n**7. Match the Result with the Options**\n\n*   The calculated angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular diameter of the central bright spot, 2 * θ₁)\n    B) 0.500 λ / a  (An approximation, but not as accurate as D)\n    C) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the angular position of the first minimum, θ₁)\n    D) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculated result)\n\nThe result that most closely matches the computed value is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "When a regular N-sided polygon has an infinitely large number of sides (N -> ∞), it approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity minima (dark rings) in this pattern occur at specific angles.\n\nThe angular position θ of the minima for a circular aperture is given by the formula:\n`sin(θ) = z * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `z` are the roots (zeros) of the first-order Bessel function, `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Thus, the formula becomes:\n`θ = z * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nTo find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the `J₁(x)` Bessel function:\n*   First root, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) and the second minimum (θ₂):\n*   Angular position of the first minimum:\n    `θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) = 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum:\n    `θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) = 7.0156 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the **angular distance between the first two minima**, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ / (2π) * λ/a) - (z₁ / (2π) * λ/a)`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\nThis value rounds to `0.507 λ / a`. Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
