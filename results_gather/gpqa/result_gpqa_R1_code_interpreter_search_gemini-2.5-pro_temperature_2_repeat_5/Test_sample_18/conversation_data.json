    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1 Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: Michael Addition.\n*   **Reactants**:\n    1.  **Michael Donor Precursor**: `methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor**: `2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene`.\n*   **Reagents**: `NaOEt` (Sodium ethoxide) in `THF` (Tetrahydrofuran).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Michael Donor**\nThe base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton on the donor precursor. In `methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate`, the proton at Carbon 1 (C1) is located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups (a ketone at C2 and an ester at C1). This makes the C1 proton exceptionally acidic (it's an active methylene proton). Deprotonation at C1 forms a stable enolate, which acts as the nucleophilic Michael donor. Deprotonation at C3 is much less favorable.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Michael Acceptor**\nThe Michael acceptor is `2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene`. The chemical formula is `(CH3)2-C6H3-S(O)-CH=CH2`. The vinyl group (`-CH=CH2`) is activated by the adjacent electron-withdrawing sulfoxide group (`-S(O)-`). This makes the C=C double bond susceptible to nucleophilic attack. In a conjugated system like `X-Cα=Cβ`, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon. Here, the system is `Ar-S(O)-CHα=CHβ2`. The attack occurs at the terminal `CH2` carbon (the β-carbon).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Reaction**\nThe enolate formed at C1 of the cyclohexane derivative will attack the β-carbon of the vinyl sulfoxide. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the vinyl group. A subsequent protonation step (during workup) neutralizes the intermediate.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure and Name of Product A**\n*   The original `methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate` gets a new substituent at the C1 position.\n*   The substituent is derived from `2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene` after the addition and protonation: `-CH2-CH2-S(O)-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)`.\n*   This substituent group is named `2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl`.\n*   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **methyl 1-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\nThis result eliminates options C and D, which suggest the addition occurs at the C3 position.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2 Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: Michael Addition.\n*   **Reactants**:\n    1.  **Michael Donor Precursor**: `ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor**: `methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate`.\n*   **Reagents**: `NaH` (Sodium hydride) in `THF`.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Michael Donor**\nThe base, sodium hydride (NaH), is a very strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the precursor `ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate` (`CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOEt`). The only acidic proton is the one on the α-carbon (C2), which is adjacent to the ester's carbonyl group. This forms an enolate anion, `[CH3-CH2-C(-)(CH2CH3)-COOEt]`, which is the Michael donor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Michael Acceptor**\nThe Michael acceptor is `methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate`. The name indicates a `methyl ... acetate` backbone (`-CH2-COOMe`) with substituents at C2. The substituents are a `phenyl` group (`-C6H5`) and a `cyclopentylidene` group (`=C5H8`, a cyclopentane ring attached via a double bond). The structure is `(C5H8)=C(C6H5)-COOMe`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The C=C double bond is conjugated with the ester's C=O group.\n*   **α-carbon**: The carbon atom attached to the phenyl group (`=C(Ph)-`).\n*   **β-carbon**: The carbon atom that is part of the cyclopentane ring (`(C5H8)=`).\nThe nucleophilic attack will occur at this β-carbon.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Reaction**\nThe enolate of `ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate` will attack the β-carbon (the ring carbon) of `methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate`. This breaks the C=C π-bond, and the electrons move to the α-carbon, which is stabilized by resonance with the ester. A subsequent protonation during workup adds a proton to this α-carbon.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure and Name of Product B**\n*   A new C-C single bond connects the α-carbon of the donor (`C2` of the butanoate) to the β-carbon of the acceptor (`C1` of the cyclopentyl ring).\n*   The connection point on the cyclopentyl ring becomes a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to:\n    1.  Two other carbons within the cyclopentane ring.\n    2.  The `ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate` fragment (at its C2).\n    3.  The `-CH(Ph)-COOMe` fragment (which was originally `=C(Ph)-COOMe`).\n*   Let's analyze the name `ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate`:\n    *   **Parent chain**: `ethyl ... butanoate`, with a `2-ethyl` group. This matches the donor `CH3CH2-C(Et)(...)-COOEt`.\n    *   **Substituent at C2**: a `cyclopentyl` group, attached via its C1 to the butanoate's C2.\n    *   **Substituent on the cyclopentyl ring**: at its C1 position, there is another group: `1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)`. This group is `-CH(Ph)-COOMe`.\n    *   This name perfectly describes a structure where the C1 of a cyclopentyl ring is attached to both the butanoate alpha-carbon and the `-CH(Ph)COOMe` group. This matches the structure we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n*   Therefore, the full name of product **B** is **ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate**.\n\nThe alternative name for B, given in options A and D, is a `succinate` derivative. As analyzed, the atom connectivity in a succinate does not match the product of this specific Michael addition.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `methyl 1-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate`.\n*   **Product B** is `ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate`.\n\nComparing these conclusions with the given options, only option B contains the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
