    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. It reacts with a cyanide source (NaCN) and a proton source to form a cyanohydrin.\n    *   The mechanism proceeds in two steps:\n        1.  Nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n        2.  Protonation of the alkoxide intermediate by a proton source (an acid) to form the final α-hydroxy nitrile (cyanohydrin) product.\n            `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). In chemistry, H₃O⁺ represents an aqueous acidic medium, typically provided by a strong mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄. This is the standard condition for this reaction.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) forms a bisulfite addition product, which is a different reaction.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A = H₃O⁺**. This narrows our choices to C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is called hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN + 2H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n    *   The reagent B, in the presence of water (H₂O), must be able to facilitate this hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's compare the options for B:\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong mineral acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction often requires heating.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak organic acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for this hydrolysis is a strong acid, making reagent **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
