    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction Conditions.**\n    *   Reactant: 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   Conditions: Heating. Heating a non-conjugated diene, especially a 1,5-diene system, strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction, most notably the Cope rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Draw the Structure of the Reactant.**\n    *   \"nona\": The main carbon chain has 9 carbons.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\": There are double bonds starting at carbon 2 (between C2 and C3) and carbon 6 (between C6 and C7).\n    *   \"5-butyl\": A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   Numbering the chain from left to right to give the double bonds the lowest locants (2 and 6):\n        CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n\n3.  **Identify the Reacting System.**\n    The structure contains a hexa-1,5-diene core, which is the requirement for a Cope rearrangement. The six carbons involved in this rearrangement are C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.\n    Let's label these six carbons as 1' through 6' for clarity during the analysis of the rearrangement, to avoid confusion with the IUPAC numbering.\n    *   C1' = C2\n    *   C2' = C3\n    *   C3' = C4\n    *   C4' = C5\n    *   C5' = C6\n    *   C6' = C7\n\n4.  **Understand the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism.**\n    The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In a 1,5-diene system labeled C1'=C2'-C3'--C4'-C5'=C6', the following bond changes occur in a concerted manner through a six-membered cyclic transition state:\n    *   The sigma bond between C3' and C4' breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between C1' and C6'.\n    *   The pi bond between C1' and C2' moves to between C2' and C3'.\n    *   The pi bond between C5' and C6' moves to between C4' and C5'.\n\n    Essentially, the molecule is \"reassembled\" with a new connectivity.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Product.**\n    Let's analyze the transformation of our specific molecule piece by piece, keeping track of all atoms and groups.\n    *   Reactant core with substituents:\n        *   On C1' (C2): A methyl group (-CH₃, which is C1) and a hydrogen.\n        *   On C2' (C3): A hydrogen.\n        *   On C3' (C4): Two hydrogens (-CH₂- group).\n        *   On C4' (C5): A butyl group (-C₄H₉) and a hydrogen.\n        *   On C5' (C6): A hydrogen.\n        *   On C6' (C7): An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃, which is C8-C9) and a hydrogen.\n\n    *   Apply the bond changes to form the product:\n        *   **New C1'-C6' bond:** A sigma bond now connects C2 and C7.\n        *   **Broken C3'-C4' bond:** The bond between C4 and C5 is gone.\n        *   **New C2'=C3' double bond:** A double bond forms between C3 and C4.\n        *   **New C4'=C5' double bond:** A double bond forms between C5 and C6.\n\n    *   Assemble the product structure based on this new connectivity. Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   The methyl-bearing C2 is now bonded to C3 and C7.\n        *   The butyl-bearing C5 is no longer bonded to C4.\n        *   We can trace the new main carbon chain. A good way to visualize the product is to imagine the C3'-C4' link is cut, and the C1' and C6' ends are joined together. The two fragments (C1'-C2'-C3' and C4'-C5'-C6') are reoriented.\n\n    The connectivity of the product is:\n    (C1)CH₃-CH(C2)-CH(C3)=CH₂(C4)\n              |\n             CH(C7)-CH(C6)=CH(C5)-(C₄H₉ butyl chain)\n              |\n            (C8-C9)CH₂CH₃\n\n    Let's draw this out as a single linear structure to name it. We must find the longest carbon chain that contains the maximum number of double bonds.\n    The new molecule's skeleton is:\n    CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)\n       (C4)(C3) (C2)      (C7)      (C6)   (C5 and Butyl)\n\n6.  **Name the Product Molecule.**\n    To name the product, we find the longest continuous carbon chain containing both double bonds.\n    *   Starting from the left CH₂=, the chain is:\n        C=C-C(Me)-C(Et)-C=C-C-C-C-C\n    *   Let's number this chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the left gives the double bonds starting at C1 and C5.\n        `1    2    3      4        5    6    7    8    9    10`\n        `CH₂=`CH-`CH(CH₃)-`CH(CH₂CH₃)-`CH=`CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   The parent chain has 10 carbons, so it is a **deca-** derivative.\n    *   The double bonds are at positions 1 and 5, so it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   There are two substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) on carbon 3.\n        *   An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) on carbon 4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full IUPAC name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options.**\n    A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
