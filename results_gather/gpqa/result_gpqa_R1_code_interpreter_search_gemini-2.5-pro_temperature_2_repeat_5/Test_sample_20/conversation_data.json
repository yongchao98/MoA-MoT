    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a phenomenon where a single compound exists in two or more interconvertible structures that are in equilibrium. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is a -CH2- group, meaning they possess alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol form, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus very stable, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any attached hydrogens that can be easily removed to form an enol; they lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** (a type of stereoisomerism) is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ and has a *trans* configuration around the double bond. The molecule is planar. Due to its symmetrical *trans* structure, it has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate *will not* show optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination:**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
