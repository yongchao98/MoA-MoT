    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Total Proton Count:** First, let's determine the total number of protons represented in the spectrum. By adding the integrations (the number of protons for each signal), we get 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\n2.  **Compare Proton Count with Possible Compounds:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 hydrogen atoms (protons). This matches our proton count.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms (protons). This does not match our proton count.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the integration alone, we can rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (A). The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Signals in Detail to Determine the Isomer (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). This is present in all the propenyl acetate options.\n\n    *   **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** These two signals are for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). Let's call them Hₐ and Hₑ.\n\n    *   **Key Signal: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is a single vinylic proton.\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to (split by) only one other proton.\n        *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. For vinylic protons, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** relationship across the double bond. A smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n        *   The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a **trans** isomer.\n\n    *   **Let's confirm the other signals fit a Trans-propenyl acetate structure:**\n        *   Structure:\n            \n           CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n\n        *   **Proton H(a):** This proton is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). It is coupled to H(b). This perfectly matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)**.\n\n        *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to H(a) (giving a doublet, J=16.0 Hz) and is also coupled to the three protons of the methyl group CH₃(c) (giving a quartet). The resulting splitting pattern is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n\n        *   **Protons H(c):** This is the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton H(b), so it will appear as a **doublet (d)**. This matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n\n        *   **Protons H(d):** This is the acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it is a **singlet (s)**. This matches the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The total proton count rules out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans-alkene. All signals in the spectrum perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
