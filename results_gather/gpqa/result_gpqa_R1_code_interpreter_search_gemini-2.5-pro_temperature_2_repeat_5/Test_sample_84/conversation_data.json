    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to calculate the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{a_1})^{1/2}}{(\\frac{1}{a_2})^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Observables:** The semi-major axis can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) gives the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$).\n    $K_{star} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit ($e=0$) is also given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} v_{orb}$\n    where $v_{orb}$ is the planet's orbital velocity, $v_{orb} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star} + M_p)}{a}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$ (since $M_p \\ll M_{star}$).\n    The fact that the planets were detected by the transit method implies their orbits are likely viewed edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n    Substituting $v_{orb}$ into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n    $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis (a):** We rearrange the formula to solve for 'a':\n    $K_{star}^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_{star}^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_{star,2}^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_{star,1}^2}}$\n    The terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constants and cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_{star,2}^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_{star,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^2$\n\n    Since $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$ (i.e., $K_{star,1} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1$ and $K_{star,2} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2$), the ratio $\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}$ is equal to $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7.0  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5.0  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by:\n# (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nratio_T_eq = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(f\"{ratio_T_eq=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nratio_T_eq=0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
