    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transition and the mechanism.**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). This decay occurs via *two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions*. This means there must be an intermediate state. A direct single-photon transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the E1 selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Apply the electric dipole (E1) selection rules.**\n    For an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For spontaneous emission (decay), we must have $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate state(s).**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The first transition is $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state ($l=0, m=0$):\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a *p*-state.\n        *   Since this is a decay process, $n' < 3$. The possible principal quantum numbers for the intermediate state are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is possible, so we must have $n'=2$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$. These are the three degenerate states of the 2*p* subshell.\n\n4.  **Determine the second transition.**\n    The second transition is from the intermediate state $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's check if this is allowed by the selection rules for each possible $m'$:\n        *   The change in $l$ is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$, the change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, the change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$, which is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, the change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Thus, all three states in the 2*p* subshell can decay to the 1s ground state. The three possible cascade routes are:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of a specific route.**\n    The probability of a specific cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step. The branching ratio is the fraction of atoms in a given state that will decay through a particular channel.\n\n    *   **Step 1 Branching Ratio: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). When it decays, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equal. Since these are the only possible states for the first decay step, the total probability of 1 is split equally among them.\n        *   Branching Ratio $B(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   Branching Ratio $B(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   Branching Ratio $B(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Step 2 Branching Ratio: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        Now consider an atom in one of the intermediate states, for example, $|2,1,0\\rangle$. What can it decay into? According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, it must decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since it's a decay, the final state must have $n<2$, so $n=1$. The only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$ which has $l=0$. There are no $l=2$ states with $n=1$.\n        Therefore, the *only possible* E1 decay channel for any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n        *   Branching Ratio $B(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ (for any $m'$).\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a Route**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the branching ratios. For the route specified in option C:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = B(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times B(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is $1/3$, not $1/4$.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is $1/3$, not $2/3$.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. Both the route and the probability are correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is $1/3$, not $1/4$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# Step 1: Branching Ratio from |3,0,0>\n# Initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0).
