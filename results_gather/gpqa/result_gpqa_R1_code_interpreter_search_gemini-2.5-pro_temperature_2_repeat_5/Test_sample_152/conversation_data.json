    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOMe)₂`. The α-protons on the carbon between the two ester groups are highly acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (`NaOEt`), deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition Reaction:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The double bond electrons shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOMe`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (`EtOH`), at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The resulting product has the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   To name this structure systematically, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters).\n    *   The chain is `C1-C2-C3` where `C1` is `-CH(COOMe)₂`, `C2` is `-CH(p-tolyl)-`, and `C3` is `-CH₂(COOMe)`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the principal groups the lowest possible locants. So, we number it as: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOMe`.\n    *   Parent chain: Propane.\n    *   Functional Groups: Three methyl ester (methoxycarbonyl) groups, making it a tricarboxylate. They are at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n    *   Substituent: A p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    *   Full name: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine` is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. Its structure is `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition and Hydrolysis:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with acid (`H₃O⁺`) has two effects: it protonates the nitrile-derived carbanion and hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from the butenenitrile.\n    *   The butenenitrile `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` substituent.\n    *   The product structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   Naming this structure with butanenitrile as the parent chain: The chain is `N≡C-CH₂-CH-CH₃`. Numbering from the nitrile `C` as C1, we get a butanenitrile backbone.\n    *   The `cyclohexanone` ring is a substituent at C3, attached via its C2 position. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Full name: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is more stable than the enol (`2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl`) form, making this the major final product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton has a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)CH₃` group at its C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Unknown Reactant C:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the bond forms between the Michael donor's nucleophilic carbon and the Michael acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which corresponds to the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (`C`) must be the rest of the molecule, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   The C2 position of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is highly acidic due to the two flanking carbonyl groups. The base (`KOH`) deprotonates it to form the required nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Thus, reactant `C` is **`cyclohexane-1,3-dione`**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option D matches all three parts correctly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
