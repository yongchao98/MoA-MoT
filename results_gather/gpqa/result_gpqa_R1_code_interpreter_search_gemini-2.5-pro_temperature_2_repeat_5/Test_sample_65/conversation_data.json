    "This is a conceptual question about the fundamental principles of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT, like the Standard Model and any relativistic quantum field theory describing our universe, is built on the principle of Lorentz invariance. This means the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial reference frames. The operators in the SMEFT are constructed as scalars, vectors, spinors, or tensors that transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations, ensuring the Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It consists of the Lorentz group (rotations and boosts) and the group of spacetime translations. A key assumption in constructing the SMEFT Lagrangian is that it is invariant under Poincare transformations. This is a foundational principle of the theory. Since the Poincare group contains the Lorentz group, respecting Poincare symmetry automatically implies respecting Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry through the complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Since the SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model that parametrizes potential new physics, it is not required to be CP-invariant. In fact, one of the primary motivations for SMEFT is to provide a model-independent way to search for new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. The SMEFT contains many higher-dimensional operators that explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** CPT symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Lorentz Symmetry (1) is required.\n*   Poincare Symmetry (2) is required.\n*   CP Symmetry (3) is **not** required.\n*   CPT Symmetry (4) is required due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
