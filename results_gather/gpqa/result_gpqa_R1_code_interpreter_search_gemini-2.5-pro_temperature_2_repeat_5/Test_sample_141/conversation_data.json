    "To determine the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space (also known as the Bloch sphere), we need to find its corresponding Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz).\n\n**1. The Density Matrix:**\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented by column vectors:\n|0⟩ = $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n|1⟩ = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are then:\n|0⟩⟨0| = $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ [1  0] = $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n|1⟩⟨1| = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ [0  1] = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for ρ:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is half of the 2x2 identity matrix, I.\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\nThis state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\n**2. The Bloch Sphere Representation:**\n\nAny single-qubit density matrix ρ can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix I and the Pauli matrices σ = (σx, σy, σz) using the Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz):\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z)$\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\nσx = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nσy = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nσz = $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Finding the Bloch Vector r:**\n\nWe have two expressions for our density matrix:\n1.  From the problem: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n2.  From the general form: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z)$\n\nLet's equate them:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z)$\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n$I = I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n\nSubtract I from both sides:\n$0 = r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only hold true if all the coefficients (rx, ry, rz) are zero.\nTherefore, rx = 0, ry = 0, and rz = 0.\n\nThe Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n**Alternative Method using Trace:**\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated using the formula:\n$r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$ for k = x, y, z.\n\nLet's calculate each component with our ρ = $\\frac{1}{2}I$:\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n\nBoth methods give the same result: **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\nThis geometrical position corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe geometrical position is given by the vector r=(0,0,0). This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
