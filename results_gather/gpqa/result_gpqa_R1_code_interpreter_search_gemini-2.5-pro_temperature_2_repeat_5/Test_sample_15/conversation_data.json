    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50/50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). Naming a specific stereoisomer implies we are considering it in its pure form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is equivalent to saying it lacks any improper axis of rotation (S_n), including a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ = S_1) and a center of inversion (i = S_2).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H from C1; a C from methyl and a C from ethyl from C2) lie in a single plane. Due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` refer to the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (chiral carbons). The existence of stable enantiomers with specific R/S configurations is a hallmark of a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The four groups attached to C2 are the same as the four groups attached to C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is called a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion). Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has the same configuration at both stereocenters (`R,R`). This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing one double bond, with a hydroxyl group on a saturated carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon-1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -OH group, a -H atom, a -CH=CH- segment of the ring (C2-C3 path), and a -CH2-CH2- segment of the ring (C6-C5 path). The molecule as a whole lacks internal symmetry. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups have the same relative orientation, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is a highly symmetric molecule. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the C-H bond on the opposite carbon of the ring. A molecule with even one plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any stereocenters or other elements of chirality. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbons:\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring: All are CH2 groups and thus not stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n        *   In the butanoyl chain: The carbons at positions 1 (-C=O-), 2 (-CH2-), and 4 (the two -CH3) are not stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (-CH3), and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (e.g., axial, planar). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n*   Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>"
