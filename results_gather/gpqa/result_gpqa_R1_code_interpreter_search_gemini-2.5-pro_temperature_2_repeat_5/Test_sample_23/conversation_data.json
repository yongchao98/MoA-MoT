    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1.\n    *   For a general hydrocarbon `CnHm`, the mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Let's test the given percentage: 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let's see which hydrocarbon formula class fits `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula `CnH2n` corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenating other substances and that Z itself \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, while a cycloalkane is saturated.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula `CnH2n`.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z itself is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also hydrogenate to Z (`CnH2n`). This means Y2 must have the same carbon skeleton (n carbon atoms in a ring).\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which matches the problem description.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic ring structure is benzene (C6H6). If Y2 is benzene, then n=6.\n    *   This implies that `Z = C6H12` (cyclohexane) and `Y2 = C6H6` (benzene).\n    *   This is a very plausible scenario: Z=cyclohexane is a widely used solvent, and its hydrogenation gives itself. Y2=benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. A disproportionation is a redox reaction where a species is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context (Pt catalyst), it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2 -> 1 molecule of Y1 + 1 molecule of Y2`.\n    *   Substituting the components of Y we identified: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both X1 and X2 have the same C6-ring carbon skeleton as cyclohexane. So their formulas are `C6Hx` and `C6Hy`.\n    *   Based on the principle of conservation of mass for the disproportionation reaction, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Looking at the hydrogen atoms: `(Number of H in X1) + (Number of H in X2) = (Number of H in C6H12) + (Number of H in C6H6)`.\n    *   Total H in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to this sum.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but recommended)**\n    *   Let's check if we can find plausible structures for X1 and X2.\n    *   `X1 = C6Hx`, `X2 = C6Hy`, with `x+y=18`.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Let's try `X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10)` and `X2 = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)`.\n        *   Does x+y=18? Yes, 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Does cyclohexene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does cyclohexa-1,4-diene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does it have conjugated bonds? No, the double bonds at positions 1 and 4 are isolated. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated bonds and is excluded by the problem statement).\n        *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the diene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is chemically reasonable over a Pt catalyst.\n    *   This successful identification of X1 and X2 confirms our stoichiometric calculation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
