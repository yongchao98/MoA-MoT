    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 benzene core with two substituents.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum (6 signals total):**\n        *   **2 signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals is characteristic of certain substitution patterns, like para-substitution (which would give an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals/doublets). Total H count from this part is 4.\n        *   **2 signals for vinyl-H (C=CH):** One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is highly indicative of a propenyl group, specifically the `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n            *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `Ha` is adjacent to one proton (`Hb`), so it would appear as a **doublet**. This matches the data.\n            *   Proton `Hb` is adjacent to one proton (`Ha`) and three equivalent protons of the methyl group. This coupling would split the signal into a **doublet of quartets**. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   Therefore, one of the substituents contains a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has 2 vinyl protons.\n        *   **2 signals for -CH3 groups:**\n            *   One of these methyl groups is the one from the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This methyl group is adjacent to the `Hb` vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule. Given the presence of an ester and the constraint of \"no -CH2- groups\", the most likely position for this methyl is as the alkyl part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or the acetyl part of a phenyl acetate-type ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n            *   This confirms the presence of two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a key constraint that confirms our proposed fragments, as neither a propenyl group, a methyl ester group, nor a phenyl acetate-type group contain any `-CH2-` (methylene) units.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure from the fragments:**\n    *   **Core:** C6H4 (di-substituted benzene ring).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group, e.g., `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Let's check if this structure (a propenyl methylbenzoate) fits all the data.\n        *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   It contains an ester.\n        *   The NMR signals match perfectly (2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 methyl).\n        *   It has no -CH2- groups.\n        *   The total number of 1H NMR signals would be 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the given information.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of protons:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options with H14 (A and D). We are left with B (C12H12O2) and C (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of Carbon and Oxygen atoms:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 C (from C=O) + 1 C (from O-CH3) = 2 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 O.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Based on the atom count, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with other possibilities and Degree of Unsaturation (DBU):**\n    *   The alternative ester structure, propenyl phenyl acetate (`CH3CO-O-C6H4-CH=CHCH3`), also gives the formula C11H12O2. So regardless of the exact isomer, the formula is the same.\n    *   The DBU for C11H12O2 is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6`. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 DBUs), one C=C double bond (1 DBU), and one C=O double bond (1 DBU).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would have a DBU of 7. It is not possible to add another DBU (e.g., another ring or double bond) and an extra Carbon to our structure without violating the strict NMR rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
