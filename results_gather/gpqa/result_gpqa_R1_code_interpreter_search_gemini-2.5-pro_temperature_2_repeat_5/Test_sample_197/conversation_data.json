    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to all other cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Equilibria**\nWe have cobalt(II) ions, `Co^2+`, reacting with thiocyanate ligands, `SCN-`, to form a series of complexes. The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe relevant species are:\n*   Free cobalt ion: `Co^2+`\n*   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]+`\n*   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]` (the species of interest)\n*   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\nThe formation reactions and their stability constants are:\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+`\n    `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]`\n    `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-`\n    `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n    `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the Mass Balance Equation**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n**3. Express Complex Concentrations in Terms of Free Cobalt**\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN-]`.\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α) of the Target Complex**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is equivalent to its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is the concentration of the species divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 3:\n`α₂ = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n`α₂ = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M (Since the ligand is in 10-fold excess of the metal, we can assume this is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand).\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nThe calculation will be performed using a python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = b1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = b2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = b3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = b4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The fraction (α) of each species can be determined using the stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]).\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato complex)\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants:\n*   `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n*   `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n*   `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n*   `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction equation**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is the concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]` divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1` = 1\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the numerator and denominator:\n*   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 0.4\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nCalculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
