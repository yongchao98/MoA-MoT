    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during the titration of acetic acid with NaOH: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial moles of acetic acid are calculated first.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V_acid) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (C_acid_initial) = 0.05 M\n*   Moles of acetic acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid = 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n\nThe acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Final volume (V_final) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid (C_acid) is Moles / V_final.\n*   C_acid = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\nThis is the concentration of the acid at the beginning of the titration.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\nwhere:\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75, or 1:3. The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n*   [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\nNow, plug this into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze water.\n\nFirst, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n*   Moles of acid = Moles of base\n*   0.001 mol = C_NaOH * V_NaOH\n*   V_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\nNext, calculate the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion reacts with water in an equilibrium:\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we can find the [OH⁻] using the equilibrium expression for the base hydrolysis:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\nLet x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]. The equation becomes:\nKb = x² / ([CH₃COO⁻] - x)\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate [CH₃COO⁻] - x ≈ [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 M.\n*   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nFinally, calculate pOH and then pH.\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26\n*   At the equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and initial values\nc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nv_acid_initial = 20.00  # cm3\nv_water = 20.00  # cm3\nc_base = 0.1  # M\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\n# Calculate initial moles of acid\nmoles_acid = c_acid_initial * (v_acid_initial / 1000)\n# Calculate concentration after dilution\nv_acid_diluted = v_acid_initial + v_water\nc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / (v_acid_diluted / 1000)\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% titration ---\n# pKa calculation\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# pH calculation using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for buffer region\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Volume of base to reach equivalence\nv_base_eq = (moles_acid / c_base) * 1000  # in cm3\n# Total volume at equivalence\nv_total_eq = v_acid_diluted + v_base_eq\n# Concentration of conjugate base at equivalence\nc_conj_base_eq = moles_acid / (v_total_eq / 1000)\n# Kb for conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] calculation from hydrolysis of conjugate base\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * c_conj_base_eq)\n# pOH and pH calculation\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",

The pH of a buffer solution is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, we need the pKa of acetic acid.\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base ([A⁻]) to the acid ([HA]) is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        *   pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by reacting with an equimolar amount of NaOH.\n    *   First, let's find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n        *   Moles of acid = Moles of base\n        *   0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × Volume_NaOH\n        *   Volume_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Now, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point.\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n        *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) in this solution.\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, increasing the pH:\n        *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   To find the pH, we first need to find the [OH⁻] from this equilibrium.

    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Initial State and Dilution:**\n    *   First, we determine the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n        *   Initial Volume (V_acid) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Initial Concentration (C_acid) = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles of CH₃COOH = V_acid × C_acid = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The acetic acid solution is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n        *   New Volume (V_total) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution before titration begins is:\n        *   New Concentration (C'_acid) = Moles of CH₃COOH / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   Titration involves the reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n    *   This creates a buffer solution containing a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   The pH of a buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   First, calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and thus concentrations) of the conjugate base to the acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        *   pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH.
