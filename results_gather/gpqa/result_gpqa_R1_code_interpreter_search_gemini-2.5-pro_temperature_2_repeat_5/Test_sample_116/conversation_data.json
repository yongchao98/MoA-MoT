    "An optical isomer is a type of stereoisomer that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Such molecules are called chiral. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality to determine if they exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule is an example of atropisomerism, which gives rise to axial chirality. Rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large (bulky) substituent groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). Both of these groups are bulky enough to prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar through free rotation.\n*   **Symmetry:** For such a hindered biphenyl to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The substitution pattern here (nitro at 6, 6' and ester at 2, 2') results in a twisted structure that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule contains a potential stereocenter. A stereocenter (or chiral center) is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four different groups, it is a stereocenter. A molecule with one stereocenter is always chiral (unless it's part of a meso compound, which is not the case here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It is a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure has a C=C double bond with a -COOCH3 group and a -H on each carbon, arranged in a *trans* configuration.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion renders a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** Shows optical isomerism.\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Shows optical isomerism.\n*   **3. benzophenone:** Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:** Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
