    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Define Observability Criteria**\n\nTo be detected by both spectrographs, a star must meet the criteria for each observatory:\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):**\n    *   **Sky Visibility:** Must be visible from Paranal's latitude (~24.6° S). A star with declination (DEC) `δ` is visible from a latitude `φ` if `δ < 90 + φ`. For Paranal, this means `δ < 90 - 24.6 = 65.4°`. So, the star must have a declination less than +65.4°.\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** The apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than 17.0 (`m_V < 17.0`).\n\n*   **HIRES (W. M. Keck Observatory):**\n    *   **Sky Visibility:** Must be visible from Keck's latitude (~19.8° N). A star with declination (DEC) `δ` is visible from a latitude `φ` if `δ > φ - 90`. For Keck, this means `δ > 19.8 - 90 = -70.2°`. So, the star must have a declination greater than -70.2°.\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** The apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than 16.0 (`m_V < 16.0`).\n\n*   **Combined Criteria for Joint Observation:**\n    1.  **Declination (DEC):** `-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°`\n    2.  **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m_V < 16.0` (This is the stricter of the two magnitude limits).\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated using the distance modulus formula, including extinction (A_V):\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc) + A_V`\nWhere:\n*   `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude.\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)` is the total absorption in the V band.\n\nThe analysis is performed systematically using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Observability criteria\nMIN_DEC = -70.2  # Keck's southern limit\nMAX_DEC = 65.4   # Paranal's northern limit\nMAG_LIMIT = 16.0 # Strictest magnitude limit (HIRES)\n\n# --- Star Data ---\nstars = {\n    \"Star1\": {\"RA_deg\": 15, \"DEC_deg\": -75, \"M_V\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 10, \"E(B-V)\": 0},\n    \"Star2\": {\"RA_deg\": 30, \"DEC_deg\": 55, \"m_V\": 16.5, \"d_pc\": 5, \"E(B-V)\": 0},\n    \"Star3\": {\"RA_h\": 11, \"DEC_deg\": 48, \"m_V_obs\": 15.5, \"E(B-V)\": 0.6, \"d_pc\": 15},\n    \"Star4\": {\"RA_deg\": 85, \"DEC_deg\": -48, \"M_V\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 10, \"E(B-V)\": 0.4},\n    \"Star5\": {\"RA_h\": 10, \"DEC_deg\": 60, \"M_V\": 16.5, \"d_pc\": 5, \"E(B-V)\": 0}\n}\n\nprint(\"Analyzing Stars...\")\nprint(\"Criteria for joint observation:\")\nprint(f\"1.
