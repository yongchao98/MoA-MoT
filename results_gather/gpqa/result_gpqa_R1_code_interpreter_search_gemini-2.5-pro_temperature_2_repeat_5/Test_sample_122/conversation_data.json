    "This is a classic problem in special relativity involving time dilation. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame. We consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   Frame S': The supernova ejecta's reference frame. This is the \"moving\" frame relative to S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames (v) is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (S') is Δt' = 50 s. This is the proper time, as it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   The distance in frame S is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   However, we are given the time elapsed in the moving frame (S'), which is `Δt'`. Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame S will measure a longer time interval `Δt` for the same event.\n    *   The relationship between `Δt` and `Δt'` is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   By substituting the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula, we get:\n        `d = v * γ * Δt' = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Then, calculate `1 - v²/c²`:\n        `1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    *   Now, plug this into the combined distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   To get a precise numerical value, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame\ndistance = (v * delta_t_prime) / denominator\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe python script calculates the final distance based on the formula `d = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   `v * Δt'` = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km\n*   `sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = sqrt(0.96)` ≈ 0.9798\n*   `d` = 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862.18 km\n\nThis value is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. This is a problem of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Identify the variables:**\n    *   Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000` km/s.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time), `Δt' = 50` s.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000` km/s.\n\n2.  **Relativistic time dilation:**\n    An observer in the Galaxy's frame (the \"stationary\" frame) will see time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time `Δt'` that passes in the ejecta's frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance:**\n    The distance `d` traveled by the ejecta, as measured in the Galaxy's frame, is its velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt' = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    First, let's calculate the term `v * Δt'`:\n    `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored.\n\n    Next, let's calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the distance formula:\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    The executed code calculated this value to be `3061862.18` km.\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:**\n    A) 3,000,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 2,940,000 km\n    D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of `3,061,862.18` km is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
