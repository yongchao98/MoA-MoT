    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Liquid Y**\n- The problem states that a gas W is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n- Let's analyze some simple molecules:\n    - H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n    - **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Equal)\n    - He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Equal, but a noble gas, unlikely to be a product of a violent reaction).\n    - **HF (Hydrogen Fluoride):** H (1p, 0n) + F-19 (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Equal)\n- The problem also states that a precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C or 276.97 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n- If the reaction releases D₂O, it's highly likely that deuterated compounds are involved. Specifically, if B is D₂O, the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly D₂O as well, which acts as the solvent and reactant.\n- If Y is D₂O, and the reaction is with substance X, the gas released (W) must be D₂. The reaction cannot produce HF if there is no Fluorine source. This confirms W = D₂, and the reaction involves deuterium transfer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X**\n- Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n- The prompt says, \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards deuterated versions of common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), or simpler hydrides like Lithium Hydride (LiH). The \"analog\" would be the standard hydrogen version.\n- The next clue is: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    - A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-(...)-COOH. It contains at least three oxygen atoms.\n    - To get a product with only two oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced.\n    - LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids (to alcohols). The product of reducing a keto acid would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-(...)-CH₂OH, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    - NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be R-CH(OH)-(...)-COOH, which still has three oxygen atoms.\n- Therefore, the analog of X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄. This means substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify LiAlD₄ with all clues**\n- **Formula:** LiAlD₄\n- **Heavier isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of Hydrogen. ✓\n- **Organic reagent analog:** The analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and important reagent. ✓\n- **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. This reaction is violent, similar to LiAlH₄ with water. ✓\n- **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. ✓\n- **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. ✓\n- **G releases B on heating:** Heating aluminum hydroxide dehydrates it (`2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O. So B = D₂O. ✓\n- **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. ✓\n- All clues perfectly match the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n- The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n- **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n- The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n- **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number Z).\n- **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number Z).\n- **Mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen is present as 4 atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    - Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n- **Mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** In LiAlD₄, there is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    - Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n- **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    - Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
