    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a structural representation of the molecule. We will use a temporary numbering system on a benzene ring to place the groups, which may not be the final IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   **Core structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* (1,3-positions) to one another. Let's place the primary functional group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. This means the other two groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -CHO at C3\n    *   -CN at C5\n\n    ```\n        (C1)-COOH\n       /      \\\n     C6        C2\n    /          \\\n   (C5)-CN -- C4 -- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* (1,2-positions) to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (1,4-position) to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n\n    Let's update the drawing with this information:\n    ```\n          (C1)-COOH\n         /         \\\n    (C6)-(OH/NMe2) (C2)-(NMe2/OH)\n      |                |\n    (C5)-CN -------- (C4)-OCH3 -------- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Final positioning clue:** The methoxy group and the alcohol group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile group (-CN).\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The positions *ortho* to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is already at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This confirms its placement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This forces the remaining dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group to be at C2.\n\n**The final, unambiguous structure is:**\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**2. Determine the Parent Compound and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The IUPAC priority of functional groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so the parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) must be assigned locant 1 (C1).\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-NMe2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-NMe2. The locant set for the substituents is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**3. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Alphabetize the substituents:**\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino\n    3.  **F**ormyl (the prefix for a -CHO group when it's not the principal group)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the tie-breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C5.\n    *   Clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **we must use the clockwise numbering scheme**.\n\n*   **Assign the correct locants based on clockwise numbering:**\n    *   **hydroxy** is at C2\n    *   **cyano** is at C3\n    *   **methoxy** is at C4\n    *   **formyl** is at C5\n    *   **dimethylamino** is at C6\n\n*   **Construct the name:** List the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order and numbering)\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes)\n\nThe correct name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
