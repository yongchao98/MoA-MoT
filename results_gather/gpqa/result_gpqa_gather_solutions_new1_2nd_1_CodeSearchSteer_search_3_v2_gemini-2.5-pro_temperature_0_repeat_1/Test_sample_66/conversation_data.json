Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n\nA) 0\nB) 2/3\nC) 1\nD) 1/2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe analysis of the problem, supported by the execution of the Python script, leads to a definitive conclusion.\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition**: The core of the problem is to determine the probability of a specific measurement outcome (`m_1 = -1`, `m_2 = -1`) given an initial quantum state (`|l=2, m=-1>`).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Constraint**: The fundamental principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. This is expressed as a strict selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers: `m = m_1 + m_2`. A measurement outcome is only possible (i.e., has a non-zero probability) if this rule is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Applying the Constraint**:\n    *   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome has individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   The sum for the desired outcome is `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since the sum of the individual components (`-2`) does not equal the total component of the initial state (`-1`), the selection rule is violated. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly zero.\n\nThe Python script correctly models this logic.

This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum operator $L^2$ and its z-component $L_z$. The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the quantum numbers of the initial and final states must be consistent with this rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition to this state is forbidden. The probability of observing this outcome is therefore zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), which describes the total angular momentum, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), which describes the individual components. The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Key:** The most direct way to solve the problem is to check the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** This rule represents the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. It is physically impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state where the sum of the components is $-2\\hbar$, as this would violate a conservation law.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z$. However, they have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero. The probability, being the square of this inner product, is also zero.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers supports this conclusion, even though several of them selected an incorrect final letter. The physical principle is unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State of the System:**\n    The system consists of two electrons and is described in the coupled angular momentum basis. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ (as the electrons are in p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l = 2$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m = -1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the State Corresponding to the Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled basis state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:**\n    For the transition from the initial state to the final measured state to be possible, this selection rule must be obeyed.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the two values, we see that $-1 \\neq -2$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is the squared magnitude of the inner product between the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$. This inner product is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, this coefficient is exactly zero. Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires translating a question about a measurement in the uncoupled basis (`m_1`, `m_2`) to a property of a state given in the coupled basis (`l`, `m`). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients provide the formal link between these two representations.\n*   **Conservation of `m`:** The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is the most direct way to solve the problem. It is a strict conservation law. A violation means the probability is not just small, but exactly zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is to recognize that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these are two eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they must be orthogonal. Their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The system has a definite total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. It is physically impossible for a measurement of the individual components to yield a sum that is different from this total value.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify this core principle, even if some of them selected the wrong final letter. The reasoning is unanimous: the sum of the z-component quantum numbers of the desired outcome (`-2`) does not match the z-component quantum number of the system (`-1`), making the probability zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step evaluation of the problem, a list of crucial points to consider, and the final determined answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This tells us the quantum numbers for the total orbital angular momentum ($l=2$) and its projection on the z-axis ($m=-1$).\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. The eigenvalue of an $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, this measurement corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relevant Physical Principle:** In the addition of angular momentum, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator equation $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Verify the Condition:** We must check if this selection rule is satisfied for the transition from the initial state to the measured state.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:** The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, as $-1 \\neq -2$. This violation of the selection rule means that the component state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not part of the superposition that makes up the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m>$), which describes the total angular momentum, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$), which describes the individual components. A measurement of individual components like $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ projects the system onto the uncoupled basis.\n*   **The Role of Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability of this measurement is formally given by the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a fundamental property of these coefficients; if the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The result is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. A measurement cannot find the system in a state with a different total z-angular momentum (in this case, $-2\\hbar$).\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view this is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ and the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. However, they have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n\nAll candidate answers that correctly apply this fundamental principle conclude that the probability is zero. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (B, C, D) in some of the candidate answers appear to be errors, as their own reasoning correctly deduces a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Final State:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are measuring for is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   As an operator equation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum for the final state is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$) with the sum for the final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the selection rule is violated. This means it is physically impossible for a system in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ to be measured in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The transformation between them is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Selection Rule `m = m_1 + m_2`:** This is the most direct way to solve the problem. If this rule is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states is zero, and therefore the probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The final state has a total z-angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$. A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity of the system in this way. The states are orthogonal because they are eigenstates of the same operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues.\n\nThe probability of the specified measurement is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and a list of crucial points to consider for reaching the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. The most important piece of information here for this specific problem is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is **m = -1**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is given by $m_l\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator equation $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **m = m₁ + m₂**\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** We must compare the total `m` from the initial state with the sum of the individual `m` values from the desired final state.\n    *   From the initial state: `m = -1`.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome: `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied, as `-1 ≠ -2`. This means that the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is not a component of the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$. The probability of measuring an outcome that violates this conservation law is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m>$), where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$), where the individual components are well-defined. A measurement of the individual components projects the state from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally calculated as the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. The selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is a fundamental property of these coefficients; if the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ but with eigenvalue $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these are two eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal. The inner product between them is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\nAll candidate answers that perform the analysis correctly arrive at the conclusion that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be errors in matching the result (0) to the correct option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe code execution has successfully confirmed the result derived from the physical principles. The corrected Python script, using the `sympy` library to calculate the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, returned a probability of 0.\n\n### Final Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. The total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n2.  **Measurement Outcome:** The desired measurement is for the individual magnetic quantum numbers to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n3.  **Conservation Law:** The z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. This means the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n    *   $m_{initial} = -1$\n    *   $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since $m_{initial} \\neq m_{final}$, this measurement outcome is forbidden.

However, many of them selected the wrong letter corresponding to their reasoning. The correct numerical answer is 0, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State**\n\nThe system of two electrons is described in the *coupled basis*. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (p-orbitals).\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n*   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### **2. Understand the Measurement and Final State**\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n*   **Measurement**: The individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, are measured. This corresponds to projecting the system onto the *uncoupled basis*, which is described by states of the form $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n*   **Desired Outcome**: The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n*   **Final State**: The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $m_l = -1$. The desired final state is the one where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This is the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### **3. Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition**\n\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is that the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a system in a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to be found in an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ upon measurement, the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ must be satisfied. If it is not, the probability of that outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### **4. Check the Condition for This Specific Problem**\n\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Calculate the sum for the final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, compare the total $m$ from the initial state with the sum from the final state:\n$m \\stackrel{?}{=} m_1 + m_2$\n$-1 \\stackrel{?}{=} -2$\n\nThe condition is **not satisfied**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nBecause the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the desired outcome ($-2$) does not equal the total magnetic quantum number of the system's initial state ($-1$), this measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, this coefficient is zero. The code execution confirms this, showing the probability is 0. Therefore, the joint probability of this measurement is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is `m = -1`. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator with an eigenvalue of `-1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L_1z` and `L_2z` to be `-ħ`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L_1z` corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m_1 = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L_2z` corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle:** In the addition of angular momentum, the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L_1z + L_2z`. This leads to a strict conservation law for the corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m_1 + m_2`. This is a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which connect the coupled and uncoupled bases. The probability of a transition is zero if this rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Verify the Conservation Law:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** We compare the total `m` of the initial state with the sum `m_1 + m_2` of the final state.\n    *   `m = -1`\n    *   `m_1 + m_2 = -2`\n    *   Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the conservation law is violated.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Consensus on Physics:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the core physical principle: the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved (`m = m_1 + m_2`). They all correctly calculate that `m = -1` for the initial state and `m_1 + m_2 = -2` for the final state, and thus conclude the probability is zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis (`|l, m>`), where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and the uncoupled basis (`|m_1, m_2>`), where the individual components are well-defined. A measurement of the individual components projects the system from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal way to see this is that the initial state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the operator `L_z` with eigenvalue `-1ħ`. The final state `|1, -1; 1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`, but with eigenvalue `-2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `L_z`) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability, which is the squared inner product of these orthogonal states, must be zero.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** While the physical reasoning across all candidates is sound and leads to a probability of 0, there is a significant discrepancy in the final letter chosen. The correct numerical answer is 0, which corresponds to option C. Many candidates incorrectly map their correct reasoning to the wrong letter (A, B, or D). This appears to be an error in the final step of those agents' processes, not in their physical understanding.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning, the probability is 0.

The key piece of information here is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is **m = -1**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed in the operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Verify the Selection Rule:** We must check if this condition is met for the desired measurement outcome.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw a Conclusion:** The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, as $-1 \\neq -2$. This means that the uncoupled state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$. The probability of measuring an outcome that violates a conservation law is zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis (describing the total angular momentum, $|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis (describing individual components, $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The transformation between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a condition for this coefficient to be non-zero. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

For the z-component, this relationship is:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\n    This operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: the total magnetic quantum number must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is compatible with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the individual numbers is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the two, we find that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** The probability of measuring a specific outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of that outcome state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is given by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property of these coefficients is that they are zero if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n    *   Since the selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ to the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $|0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis (describing the total angular momentum) and the uncoupled basis (describing individual components). The measurement projects the state from the coupled basis onto the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Conservation Law:** The core of the problem lies in the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total z-component of $-1\\hbar$. It is physically impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state where the sum of the components is different (in this case, $-2\\hbar$).\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal way to see this is that the initial state $|2, -1>$ and the final state $|-1, -1>$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z$, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 0.

    "Based on the provided candidate answers, here is a comprehensive step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is described in the coupled angular momentum basis. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (p-orbitals).\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). This is the most critical piece of information for this problem. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Final State:** The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   **Measurement**: The individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, are measured. This corresponds to projecting the system onto the *uncoupled basis*, which is described by states of the form $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n    *   **Desired Outcome**: The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   **Final State**: The eigenvalue of an $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $m_l = -1$. The desired final state is the one where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This is the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is that the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\n    This operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    For a system in a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to be found in an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ upon measurement, the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ must be satisfied. If it is not, the probability of that outcome is exactly zero.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition for This Specific Problem:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Calculate the sum for the final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Now, compare the total $m$ from the initial state with the sum from the final state:\n    $m \\stackrel{?}{=} m_1 + m_2$\n    $-1 \\neq -2$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The condition is not satisfied. Because the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the desired outcome ($-2$) does not equal the total magnetic quantum number of the system's initial state ($-1$), this measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the joint probability of this measurement is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All provided candidate answers correctly identify the core physical principle: the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved ($m = m_1 + m_2$). They all correctly calculate that $m = -1$ for the initial state and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ for the final state, and thus correctly conclude the probability is zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where total angular momentum is well-defined, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where individual components are well-defined.

The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a fundamental property of these coefficients; if the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view this is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. However, they have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 0. According to the options provided in the question (A) 0, (B) 2/3, (C) 1, (D) 1/2, the correct choice is A.

This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum operator $L^2$ and its z-component $L_z$. The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the quantum numbers of the initial and final states must be consistent with this rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition to this state is forbidden. The probability of observing this outcome is therefore zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), which describes the total angular momentum, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), which describes the individual components. The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Key:** The most direct way to solve the problem is to check the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** This rule represents the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. It is physically impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state where the sum of the components is $-2\\hbar$, as this would violate a conservation law.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z$. However, they have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero. The probability, being the square of this inner product, is also zero.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers supports this conclusion, even though several of them selected an incorrect final letter. The physical principle is unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State of the System:**\n    The system consists of two electrons and is described in the coupled angular momentum basis. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ (as the electrons are in p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l = 2$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m = -1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the State Corresponding to the Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled basis state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:**\n    For the transition from the initial state to the final measured state to be possible, this selection rule must be obeyed.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the two values, we see that $-1 \\neq -2$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is the squared magnitude of the inner product between the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$. This inner product is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, this coefficient is exactly zero. Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires translating a question about a measurement in the uncoupled basis (`m_1`, `m_2`) to a property of a state given in the coupled basis (`l`, `m`). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients provide the formal link between these two representations.\n*   **Conservation of `m`:** The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is the most direct way to solve the problem. It is a strict conservation law. A violation means the probability is not just small, but exactly zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is to recognize that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these are two eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they must be orthogonal. Their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The system has a definite total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. It is physically impossible for a measurement of the individual components to yield a sum that is different from this total value.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify this core principle, even if some of them selected the wrong final letter. The reasoning is unanimous: the sum of the z-component quantum numbers of the desired outcome (`-2`) does not match the z-component quantum number of the system (`-1`), making the probability zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step evaluation of the problem, a list of crucial points to consider, and the final determined answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This tells us the quantum numbers for the total orbital angular momentum ($l=2$) and its projection on the z-axis ($m=-1$).\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. The eigenvalue of an $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, this measurement corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relevant Physical Principle:** In the addition of angular momentum, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator equation $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Verify the Condition:** We must check if this selection rule is satisfied for the transition from the initial state to the measured state.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:** The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, as $-1 \\neq -2$. This violation of the selection rule means that the component state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not part of the superposition that makes up the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m>$), which describes the total angular momentum, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$), which describes the individual components. A measurement of individual components like $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ projects the system onto the uncoupled basis.\n*   **The Role of Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability of this measurement is formally given by the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a fundamental property of these coefficients; if the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The result is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. A measurement cannot find the system in a state with a different total z-angular momentum (in this case, $-2\\hbar$).\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view this is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ and the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. However, they have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n\nAll candidate answers that correctly apply this fundamental principle conclude that the probability is zero. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (B, C, D) in some of the candidate answers appear to be errors, as their own reasoning correctly deduces a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Final State:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are measuring for is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   As an operator equation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum for the final state is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$) with the sum for the final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the selection rule is violated. This means it is physically impossible for a system in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ to be measured in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The transformation between them is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Selection Rule `m = m_1 + m_2`:** This is the most direct way to solve the problem. If this rule is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states is zero, and therefore the probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The final state has a total z-angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$. A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity of the system in this way.

A measurement of the individual components projects the state from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally calculated as the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. The selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is a fundamental property of these coefficients; if the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ but with eigenvalue $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these are two eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal. The inner product between them is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\nAll candidate answers that perform the analysis correctly arrive at the conclusion that the probability is 0.

However, many of them selected the wrong letter corresponding to their reasoning. The correct numerical answer is 0, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State**\n\nThe system of two electrons is described in the *coupled basis*. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (p-orbitals).\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n*   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### **2. Understand the Measurement and Final State**\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n*   **Measurement**: The individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, are measured. This corresponds to projecting the system onto the *uncoupled basis*, which is described by states of the form $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n*   **Desired Outcome**: The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n*   **Final State**: The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $m_l = -1$. The desired final state is the one where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This is the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### **3. Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition**\n\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is that the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a system in a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to be found in an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ upon measurement, the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ must be satisfied. If it is not, the probability of that outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### **4. Check the Condition for This Specific Problem**\n\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Calculate the sum for the final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, compare the total $m$ from the initial state with the sum from the final state:\n$m \\stackrel{?}{=} m_1 + m_2$\n$-1 \\stackrel{?}{=} -2$\n\nThe condition is **not satisfied**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nBecause the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the desired outcome ($-2$) does not equal the total magnetic quantum number of the system's initial state ($-1$), this measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, this coefficient is zero. The code execution confirms this, showing the probability is 0. Therefore, the joint probability of this measurement is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is `m = -1`. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator with an eigenvalue of `-1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L_1z` and `L_2z` to be `-ħ`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L_1z` corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m_1 = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L_2z` corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle:** In the addition of angular momentum, the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L_1z + L_2z`. This leads to a strict conservation law for the corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m_1 + m_2`. This is a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which connect the coupled and uncoupled bases. The probability of a transition is zero if this rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Verify the Conservation Law:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** We compare the total `m` of the initial state with the sum `m_1 + m_2` of the final state.\n    *   `m = -1`\n    *   `m_1 + m_2 = -2`\n    *   Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the conservation law is violated.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Consensus on Physics:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the core physical principle: the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved (`m = m_1 + m_2`). They all correctly calculate that `m = -1` for the initial state and `m_1 + m_2 = -2` for the final state, and thus conclude the probability is zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis (`|l, m>`), where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and the uncoupled basis (`|m_1, m_2>`), where the individual components are well-defined. A measurement of the individual components projects the system from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal way to see this is that the initial state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the operator `L_z` with eigenvalue `-1ħ`. The final state `|1, -1; 1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`, but with eigenvalue `-2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `L_z`) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability, which is the squared inner product of these orthogonal states, must be zero.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** While the physical reasoning across all candidates is sound and leads to a probability of 0, there is a significant discrepancy in the final letter chosen. The correct numerical answer is 0, which corresponds to option C. Many candidates incorrectly map their correct reasoning to the wrong letter (A, B, or D). This appears to be an error in the final step of those agents' processes, not in their physical understanding.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning, the probability is 0. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown and final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The key piece of information here is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is **m = -1**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed in the operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Verify the Selection Rule:** We must check if this condition is met for the desired measurement outcome.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Draw a Conclusion:** The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, as $-1 \\neq -2$. This means that the uncoupled state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$. The probability of measuring an outcome that violates a conservation law is zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis (describing the total angular momentum, $|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis (describing individual components, $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The transformation between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a condition for this coefficient to be non-zero. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of projecting the initial state onto an orthogonal state is zero.\n\nAll candidate answers that correctly apply this fundamental principle arrive at a probability of 0.

The eigenvalue of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, is therefore $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the individual operator $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. For this to be $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for the first electron must be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Similarly, for the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for the second electron must be $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** In quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum operator in a given direction is the sum of the individual angular momentum operators in that direction. For the z-component, this relationship is:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\n    This operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: the total magnetic quantum number must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is compatible with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the individual numbers is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the two, we find that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** The probability of measuring a specific outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of that outcome state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is given by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property of these coefficients is that they are zero if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n    *   Since the selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ to the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $|0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis (describing the total angular momentum) and the uncoupled basis (describing individual components). The measurement projects the state from the coupled basis onto the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Conservation Law:** The core of the problem lies in the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total z-component of $-1\\hbar$. It is physically impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state where the sum of the components is different (in this case, $-2\\hbar$).\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal way to see this is that the initial state $|2, -1>$ and the final state $|-1, -1>$ are both eigenstates of the same operator, $L_z$, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero, and thus the transition probability is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 0.

The eigenvalue of the total `L_z` operator for this state is `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L_{1z}` and `L_{2z}` as `-ħ`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L_{1z}` is `m_1ħ`. For this to be `-ħ`, the magnetic quantum number for the first electron must be `m_1 = -1`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L_{2z}` is `m_2ħ`. For this to be `-ħ`, the magnetic quantum number for the second electron must be `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator relationship `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`. This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n    `m = m_1 + m_2`\n\n    For a coupled state `|l, m>` to have a non-zero probability of being measured as the uncoupled state `|m_1, m_2>`, this condition must be met.\n\n4.  **Verify the Selection Rule:**\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's check the sum: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n    Comparing the two, we find that `m ≠ m_1 + m_2` (since `-1 ≠ -2`).\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** The probability of this measurement is the square of the magnitude of the inner product between the final and initial states, `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>`. This inner product is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   Because the selection rule `m = m_1 + m_2` is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is, by definition, zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is `|0|^2 = 0`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is a classic example of changing basis. The system is prepared in the coupled basis (where the total angular momentum is well-defined) and is measured in the uncoupled basis (where the individual components are measured). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the mathematical tool for this transformation.\n*   **Conservation Law:** The core of the solution is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a definite total `L_z` eigenvalue of `-1ħ`. The state we are trying to measure it in has a total `L_z` eigenvalue of `-2ħ`. Since these eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal, making the transition impossible.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers almost universally arrive at the correct reasoning: the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (`-2`) does not equal the total magnetic quantum number (`-1`), so the probability is zero. However, many of them incorrectly associate this correct reasoning with the wrong multiple-choice option (A, B, or D). The correct numerical answer is 0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe measurement is physically impossible because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.
