This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\n**Structure of the Starting Material:**\n```\n      O-iBu\n     //\nHO-C-CH2-CH-CH2-C\n  ||      |    ||\n  O       Et   O\n  C1 C2  C3 C4 C5\n```\nThis is the general structure for starting materials A and B. The chiral center is at carbon C3. The reactions involve reducing either the carboxylic acid group (at C1) or the ester group (at C5) to a primary alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Structure of the Product:**\nThe product is a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O  C(6)\n  |       |\n C(3)----C(4)--Et\n         |\n        C(5)\n```\nSince the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the absolute three-dimensional configuration of the stereocenter is preserved throughout the reaction sequence. However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards the nucleophilic hydride.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Acid): `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during this step. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must have the (R) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority: C→C→O(C))\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority: C→C→O(H))\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Acid:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (Highest priority: C→C→O,O,O)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority: C→C→O,H,H)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #2 in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1 in the intermediate. The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes part of the new priority #2 group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Because the relative priorities of the top two groups have swapped, the R/S designation is inverted, even though the absolute configuration is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for A:** To get the (R)-lactone as the final product, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Ester): `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must have the (S) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material B to the intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material B:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Ester:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced but the resulting group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is still priority #2 (since it's higher priority than the ethyl group). The priority order of the substituents (1 > 2 > 3) does not change.\n    *   Therefore: The R/S designation is preserved. (S)-Starting Material B → (S)-Intermediate → (S)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for B:** To get the (S)-lactone as the final product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products**\n\n*   **Reaction A Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction B Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBoth products are δ-lactones (six-membered cyclic esters). They are enantiomers of each other. The chiral center is at position 4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\nThe structure of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicates that its open-chain precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH\n\nThe chiral center in this precursor is at C3. Upon cyclization, the C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization step.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nTo get the required precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) from this starting material, a reduction must occur. Comparing the structures, the ester group at C5 must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group at C1 must remain unchanged.\n\n**Transformation:**\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n\n### **4. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Starting Material A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the precursor must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which in turn must come from the (R)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Starting Material B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its high chemoselectivity, typically reducing carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, for the reaction to yield the given product (a 4-ethyl-lactone), the ester group must be reduced, not the carboxylic acid. Reduction of the carboxylic acid would lead to a different product (a 3-ethyl-lactone), which is not observed.\n*   **Mechanism:** We must infer from the product that under the conditions of this specific reaction, the BH₃ reagent reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) leads to the lactone. While this reactivity is atypical for BH₃, we must assume it occurs to yield the stated product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the chiral center is not affected by the reduction or cyclization. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the precursor must be (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which must come from the (S)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The only difference is the stereochemistry at carbon 4, which is the chiral center bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-C(=O)O-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which corresponds to carbon 4 in the final lactone product.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally *not* strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group in the starting material is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Match:**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reagents and their selectivity.\n# LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols but is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.\n# A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n# The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the product).\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (R), the starting material A must also be (R).\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2.\n# B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material B has the same structure type.\n# BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n# This reaction also does not affect the chiral center at C3.\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (S), the starting material B must also be (S).\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# This combination matches option C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\")\nprint(f\"A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {final_choice}\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nThis corresponds to option: C\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product for both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure.\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is assigned position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   This structure is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone), which is a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring.\n*   The molecule has a single stereocenter at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the lactone is as follows (with IUPAC numbering):\n```\n      O(1)\n     /   \\\nC(6)H2 -- C(2)=O\n|         |\nC(5)H2 -- C(3)H2\n   \\     /\n    C(4)H(Et)\n```\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The ethyl group is on C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an ester group with an isobutyl alcohol component (-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n*   The structure has a single stereocenter at C3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n    O                                O\n   //                               //\nHO--C(1)--CH2(2)--CH(3)--CH2(4)--C(5)--O--CH2--CH(CH3)2\n                  |\n                  CH2CH3\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the ester at C5: `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl` is reduced to `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)H₂-OH`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates intermediates and catalyzes the subsequent intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the product). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is unchanged.\n    *   However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-COOH` (let's call this G_acid), and `-CH₂-COOiBu` (let's call this G_ester). Comparing G_acid and G_ester, the ester group has higher priority. So, the priority order is: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from G_acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from G_ester). Comparing these, the group derived from the acid has higher priority. So, the priority order is: (from G_acid) > (from G_ester) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main chain substituents have swapped. This means that if the starting material has an (S) configuration, the product will have an (R) configuration (and vice-versa).\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the carboxylic acid at C1: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-...` is reduced to `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-...`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as before. Priority order: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** Same lactone as in Reaction 1. The group derived from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) has higher priority than the group derived from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). So, the priority order is: (from G_ester) > (from G_acid) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained throughout the reaction sequence. This means that the configuration is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) product.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same compound. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe problem involves two separate reactions starting from stereoisomers of the same compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, and producing stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents and how the stereochemistry is affected.\n\n**Starting Material Structure:**\nThe starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.

The chiral center is at carbon-3 (C3), marked with an asterisk in some representations.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester).

This C4 atom corresponds to the C3 atom of the starting material.\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:**\n1.  **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n2.  **BH₃ (Borane):** This is also a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** typically reduce esters under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) LiBH₄-->   HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--CH2OH\n          (A)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy acid)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl centers, which are two carbons away from the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is not altered (no inversion or racemization occurs). However, the R/S designation might change if the chemical transformation alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu (higher priority than the acid group because isobutyl > H)\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the ring fragment -CH₂C(=O)O-, and the ring fragment -CH₂CH₂O-.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in A) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in A) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Since the groups with priorities 1 and 2 in the starting material have their priorities swapped in the product, the R/S designation will be inverted.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-A → (S)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(R)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) BH₃-->   HOCH2--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n          (B)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy ester)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, displacing isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction does not alter the configuration of the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in B) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in B) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The group with priority 1 in the starting material becomes the group with priority 1 in the product. The group with priority 2 becomes the group with priority 2. The priority order of the substituents is preserved. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained.\n        *   (S)-B → (S)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-B → (R)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(S)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\nThe starting material in the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). It also has a chiral center at the 3-position. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which forms from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereochemistry of the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone is specified in each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched. This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the lactone.\n\nThe reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the starting material, which becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group at C5 intact. This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 position is retained throughout the reaction sequence. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material B:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products:\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of different reducing agents towards functional groups, specifically esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of a dicarboxylic acid monoester: `(R)-` or `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs through the reduction of one of the carbonyl-containing groups to an alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material (A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxyl group and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at carbon 3 (C3) of the starting material is not involved in the reaction and becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 (C4) of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A** must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃), often used as a complex with THF (BH₃-THF), is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (B) to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the isobutyl ester, forming the delta-lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected and becomes C4 in the product. The stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials. The starting material options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which forms from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH + iBuOH`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center is at the C3 position of the starting acid, which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product. Since the bonds to this chiral center are not broken or formed during the reduction or lactonization, its stereochemical configuration is retained. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is a strong reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(BH3)--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is retained throughout the process. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both cases is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nLactones like this are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify the naming:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\nWhen the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1, it forms a six-membered ring. The atoms in the ring are -O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, and the carbon with the ethyl group is position 4. Thus, the name is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. The chiral center in the starting acid (C3) becomes the chiral center in the lactone (C4).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **ester** (-CO-O-iBu)\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**. It does **not** reduce carboxylic acids (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄\n*   **Product:** (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of compound A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched (it will be deprotonated to a carboxylate salt).\n    `(A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. LiBH₄)--> [⁻OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH] Li⁺`\n2.  **Workup and Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate and the alkoxide, forming the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. This hydroxy acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + H₂O`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃\n*   **Product:** (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of compound B to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    `(B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. BH₃; 2. workup)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization:** The product of this reduction is a hydroxy-ester (**isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**). During the acidic workup (H⁺), this molecule can undergo an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the stable six-membered lactone.\n    `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + iBuOH`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction 1, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a delta-lactone. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group (C2=O), and an ethyl group at the C4 position. The reactions yield different stereoisomers, (R) and (S), at the chiral C4 center.\n*   **Lactone Precursor:** A delta-lactone like this is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Specifically, the precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n*   **Starting Materials (from options):** The proposed starting materials are of the form \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The structure is `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH4 is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(LiBH4)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the final lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is directly transferred to the product. To obtain **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH3 (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH3 is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can reduce esters, it does so much more slowly than it reduces carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid in the presence of the ester.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(BH3)--> `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction of the carboxylic acid and the subsequent transesterification do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. To obtain **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n        *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters** to alcohols. However, it is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, often faster than it reduces esters. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the **carboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, A, has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group.\n    2.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the -OH group and the -COOH group to form the final six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) is the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, B, is the other enantiomer.\n    2.  BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As before, the chiral center is not affected by the reaction sequence. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester. \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (position 2). This is a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4, which is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name and draw the structure. It is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   This molecule has two different functional groups: an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the one bearing the ethyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reducing Agents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 with Borane (BH₃):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) much faster than it reduces esters (`-COOR`).\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The `-COOH` group is reduced to `-CH₂OH`. The ester group is unaffected.\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the 6-membered lactone ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 with Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH₄ and can reduce esters. While it also reduces carboxylic acids, it is generally faster with esters. The problem's design implies a selective reduction. Given that BH₃ targets the acid, LiBH₄ must be intended to target the ester.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on how the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material are transformed. We need to apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`):**\n    The chiral center is C3. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Highest priority, let's call it **P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority, **P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P4**)\n    *Reasoning for P1 > P2:* The chains are identical until the final part of the functional group: `-O-iBu` vs `-OH`. Comparing the atoms attached to the oxygen, Carbon (in isobutyl) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Product (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):**\n    The chiral center is C4. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (ring fragment towards the carbonyl, Highest priority, **P'1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring fragment towards the ring oxygen, Second priority, **P'2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P'3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P'4**)\n    *Reasoning for P'1 > P'2:* Comparing the ring fragments atom by atom from the chiral center, the first point of difference is at the second carbon away: a carbonyl carbon (`=O`) in P'1 versus a methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) in P'2. The carbonyl carbon is considered to be bonded to more oxygen atoms, giving it higher priority.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nNow, let's trace how the groups and their priorities change in each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'1** and **P2 → P'2**. The priority order of the groups is preserved.\n    *   This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**, the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'2** and **P2 → P'1**. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction 2, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem requires identifying the correct stereoisomers of a starting material that lead to specific stereoisomers of a product after reduction with two different reagents.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The options provide the name as (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu, where the chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone, which is formed from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone, and its stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequences described.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The product of this step is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n\nSince the reactions do not affect the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nThus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, it will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The product of this step is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to Reaction A, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in the options is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can be structurally represented as `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`).\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation requires the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups of the starting material to a primary alcohol, followed by cyclization. The stereochemistry at the C3 position of the starting acid corresponds to the C4 position of the product lactone, and this stereocenter is not affected by the reduction reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄**: Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester is reduced, yielding the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Since the reaction does not alter the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must match the stereochemistry of the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagents**: BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃**: Borane is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The carboxylic acid is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As with the first reaction, the chiral center is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the two reactions relies on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃).\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, possesses both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate. Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n\nThe stereocenter at the third carbon of the starting material becomes the stereocenter at the fourth carbon of the lactone product. Since the reduction and lactonization steps do not alter the configuration of this stereocenter, the configuration of starting material A must be the same as the product. Therefore, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, forming a 5-hydroxyester intermediate. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) facilitates an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final lactone product. To yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents and, critically, how the chemical transformations affect the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents around the chiral center.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone.

While the absolute 3D configuration of the chiral center is retained (no bonds to it are broken), the R/S label can change if the CIP priorities of the attached groups are altered by the reaction.\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority, let's call it **G_ester**)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority, **G_acid**)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\n*(Reasoning: G_ester > G_acid because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon (in isobutyl), while the acid's oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.

The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n2.  **Priority Change:**\n    *   The original priority #1 group (**G_ester**) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The original priority #2 group (**G_acid**) becomes the highest priority group in the intermediate (`-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This causes an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n3.  **Result for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration.

This results in **retention of the R/S designation**.\n3.  **Result for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the same configuration. Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.

This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\n**Structure of the Starting Material:**\n```\n      O-iBu\n     //\nHO-C-CH2-CH-CH2-C\n  ||      |    ||\n  O       Et   O\n  C1 C2  C3 C4 C5\n```\nThis is the general structure for starting materials A and B. The chiral center is at carbon C3. The reactions involve reducing either the carboxylic acid group (at C1) or the ester group (at C5) to a primary alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Structure of the Product:**\nThe product is a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O  C(6)\n  |       |\n C(3)----C(4)--Et\n         |\n        C(5)\n```\nSince the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the absolute three-dimensional configuration of the stereocenter is preserved throughout the reaction sequence. However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards the nucleophilic hydride.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Acid): `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during this step. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must have the (R) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority: C→C→O(C))\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority: C→C→O(H))\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Acid:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (Highest priority: C→C→O,O,O)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority: C→C→O,H,H)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #2 in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1 in the intermediate. The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes part of the new priority #2 group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Because the relative priorities of the top two groups have swapped, the R/S designation is inverted, even though the absolute configuration is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for A:** To get the (R)-lactone as the final product, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Ester): `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must have the (S) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material B to the intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material B:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Ester:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced but the resulting group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is still priority #2 (since it's higher priority than the ethyl group). The priority order of the substituents (1 > 2 > 3) does not change.\n    *   Therefore: The R/S designation is preserved. (S)-Starting Material B → (S)-Intermediate → (S)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for B:** To get the (S)-lactone as the final product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products**\n\n*   **Reaction A Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction B Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBoth products are δ-lactones (six-membered cyclic esters). They are enantiomers of each other. The chiral center is at position 4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\nThe structure of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicates that its open-chain precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH\n\nThe chiral center in this precursor is at C3. Upon cyclization, the C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization step.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nTo get the required precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) from this starting material, a reduction must occur. Comparing the structures, the ester group at C5 must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group at C1 must remain unchanged.\n\n**Transformation:**\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n\n### **4. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Starting Material A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the precursor must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which in turn must come from the (R)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Starting Material B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its high chemoselectivity, typically reducing carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, for the reaction to yield the given product (a 4-ethyl-lactone), the ester group must be reduced, not the carboxylic acid. Reduction of the carboxylic acid would lead to a different product (a 3-ethyl-lactone), which is not observed.\n*   **Mechanism:** We must infer from the product that under the conditions of this specific reaction, the BH₃ reagent reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) leads to the lactone. While this reactivity is atypical for BH₃, we must assume it occurs to yield the stated product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the chiral center is not affected by the reduction or cyclization. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the precursor must be (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which must come from the (S)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The only difference is the stereochemistry at carbon 4, which is the chiral center bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-C(=O)O-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which corresponds to carbon 4 in the final lactone product.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally *not* strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group in the starting material is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Match:**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reagents and their selectivity.\n# LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols but is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.\n# A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n# The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the product).\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (R), the starting material A must also be (R).\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2.\n# B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material B has the same structure type.\n# BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n# This reaction also does not affect the chiral center at C3.\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (S), the starting material B must also be (S).\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# This combination matches option C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\")\nprint(f\"A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {final_choice}\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nThis corresponds to option: C\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product for both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure.\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is assigned position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   This structure is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone), which is a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring.\n*   The molecule has a single stereocenter at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the lactone is as follows (with IUPAC numbering):\n```\n      O(1)\n     /   \\\nC(6)H2 -- C(2)=O\n|         |\nC(5)H2 -- C(3)H2\n   \\     /\n    C(4)H(Et)\n```\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The ethyl group is on C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an ester group with an isobutyl alcohol component (-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n*   The structure has a single stereocenter at C3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n    O                                O\n   //                               //\nHO--C(1)--CH2(2)--CH(3)--CH2(4)--C(5)--O--CH2--CH(CH3)2\n                  |\n                  CH2CH3\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the ester at C5: `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl` is reduced to `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)H₂-OH`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates intermediates and catalyzes the subsequent intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the product). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is unchanged.\n    *   However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-COOH` (let's call this G_acid), and `-CH₂-COOiBu` (let's call this G_ester). Comparing G_acid and G_ester, the ester group has higher priority. So, the priority order is: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from G_acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from G_ester). Comparing these, the group derived from the acid has higher priority. So, the priority order is: (from G_acid) > (from G_ester) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main chain substituents have swapped. This means that if the starting material has an (S) configuration, the product will have an (R) configuration (and vice-versa).\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the carboxylic acid at C1: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-...` is reduced to `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-...`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as before. Priority order: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** Same lactone as in Reaction 1. The group derived from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) has higher priority than the group derived from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). So, the priority order is: (from G_ester) > (from G_acid) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained throughout the reaction sequence. This means that the configuration is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) product.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same compound. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe problem involves two separate reactions starting from stereoisomers of the same compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, and producing stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents and how the stereochemistry is affected.\n\n**Starting Material Structure:**\nThe starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is:\n```\n      Et\n      |\nHOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n  1    2    3    4      5\n```\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at carbon-3 (C3), marked with an asterisk in some representations.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). Its structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O   C(6)H2\n /         \\\nC(3)H2       C(5)H2\n \\         /\n  C(4)H-Et\n```\nThe chiral center in the product is at carbon-4 (C4). This C4 atom corresponds to the C3 atom of the starting material.\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:**\n1.  **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n2.  **BH₃ (Borane):** This is also a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** typically reduce esters under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) LiBH₄-->   HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--CH2OH\n          (A)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy acid)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl centers, which are two carbons away from the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is not altered (no inversion or racemization occurs). However, the R/S designation might change if the chemical transformation alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu (higher priority than the acid group because isobutyl > H)\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the ring fragment -CH₂C(=O)O-, and the ring fragment -CH₂CH₂O-.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in A) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in A) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Since the groups with priorities 1 and 2 in the starting material have their priorities swapped in the product, the R/S designation will be inverted.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-A → (S)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(R)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) BH₃-->   HOCH2--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n          (B)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy ester)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, displacing isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction does not alter the configuration of the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in B) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in B) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The group with priority 1 in the starting material becomes the group with priority 1 in the product.

It also has a chiral center at the 3-position. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which forms from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereochemistry of the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone is specified in each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched. This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the lactone.\n\nThe reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the starting material, which becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group at C5 intact. This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 position is retained throughout the reaction sequence. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material B:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products:\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of different reducing agents towards functional groups, specifically esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of a dicarboxylic acid monoester: `(R)-` or `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs through the reduction of one of the carbonyl-containing groups to an alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material (A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxyl group and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at carbon 3 (C3) of the starting material is not involved in the reaction and becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 (C4) of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A** must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃), often used as a complex with THF (BH₃-THF), is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (B) to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the isobutyl ester, forming the delta-lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected and becomes C4 in the product. The stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials. The starting material options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which forms from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH + iBuOH`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center is at the C3 position of the starting acid, which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product. Since the bonds to this chiral center are not broken or formed during the reduction or lactonization, its stereochemical configuration is retained. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is a strong reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(BH3)--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is retained throughout the process. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both cases is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nLactones like this are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify the naming:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\nWhen the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1, it forms a six-membered ring. The atoms in the ring are -O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, and the carbon with the ethyl group is position 4. Thus, the name is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. The chiral center in the starting acid (C3) becomes the chiral center in the lactone (C4).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **ester** (-CO-O-iBu)\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**. It does **not** reduce carboxylic acids (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄\n*   **Product:** (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of compound A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched (it will be deprotonated to a carboxylate salt).\n    `(A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. LiBH₄)--> [⁻OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH] Li⁺`\n2.  **Workup and Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate and the alkoxide, forming the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. This hydroxy acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + H₂O`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃\n*   **Product:** (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of compound B to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    `(B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. BH₃; 2. workup)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization:** The product of this reduction is a hydroxy-ester (**isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**). During the acidic workup (H⁺), this molecule can undergo an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the stable six-membered lactone.\n    `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + iBuOH`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction 1, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a delta-lactone. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group (C2=O), and an ethyl group at the C4 position. The reactions yield different stereoisomers, (R) and (S), at the chiral C4 center.\n*   **Lactone Precursor:** A delta-lactone like this is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Specifically, the precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n*   **Starting Materials (from options):** The proposed starting materials are of the form \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The structure is `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH4 is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(LiBH4)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the final lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is directly transferred to the product. To obtain **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH3 (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH3 is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can reduce esters, it does so much more slowly than it reduces carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid in the presence of the ester.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(BH3)--> `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction of the carboxylic acid and the subsequent transesterification do not affect the chiral center at C3.

It is strong enough to reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters** to alcohols. However, it is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, often faster than it reduces esters. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the **carboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, A, has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group.\n    2.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the -OH group and the -COOH group to form the final six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) is the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, B, is the other enantiomer.\n    2.  BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As before, the chiral center is not affected by the reaction sequence. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester. \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (position 2). This is a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4, which is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name and draw the structure. It is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   This molecule has two different functional groups: an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the one bearing the ethyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reducing Agents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 with Borane (BH₃):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) much faster than it reduces esters (`-COOR`).\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The `-COOH` group is reduced to `-CH₂OH`. The ester group is unaffected.\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the 6-membered lactone ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 with Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH₄ and can reduce esters. While it also reduces carboxylic acids, it is generally faster with esters. The problem's design implies a selective reduction. Given that BH₃ targets the acid, LiBH₄ must be intended to target the ester.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on how the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material are transformed. We need to apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`):**\n    The chiral center is C3. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Highest priority, let's call it **P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority, **P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P4**)\n    *Reasoning for P1 > P2:* The chains are identical until the final part of the functional group: `-O-iBu` vs `-OH`. Comparing the atoms attached to the oxygen, Carbon (in isobutyl) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Product (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):**\n    The chiral center is C4. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (ring fragment towards the carbonyl, Highest priority, **P'1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring fragment towards the ring oxygen, Second priority, **P'2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P'3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P'4**)\n    *Reasoning for P'1 > P'2:* Comparing the ring fragments atom by atom from the chiral center, the first point of difference is at the second carbon away: a carbonyl carbon (`=O`) in P'1 versus a methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) in P'2. The carbonyl carbon is considered to be bonded to more oxygen atoms, giving it higher priority.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nNow, let's trace how the groups and their priorities change in each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'1** and **P2 → P'2**. The priority order of the groups is preserved.\n    *   This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**, the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'2** and **P2 → P'1**. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction 2, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem requires identifying the correct stereoisomers of a starting material that lead to specific stereoisomers of a product after reduction with two different reagents.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The options provide the name as (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu, where the chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone, which is formed from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone, and its stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequences described.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The product of this step is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n\nSince the reactions do not affect the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nThus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, it will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The product of this step is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to Reaction A, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in the options is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can be structurally represented as `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`).\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation requires the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups of the starting material to a primary alcohol, followed by cyclization. The stereochemistry at the C3 position of the starting acid corresponds to the C4 position of the product lactone, and this stereocenter is not affected by the reduction reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄**: Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester is reduced, yielding the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Since the reaction does not alter the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must match the stereochemistry of the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagents**: BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃**: Borane is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The carboxylic acid is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As with the first reaction, the chiral center is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the two reactions relies on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃).\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, possesses both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate. Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n\nThe stereocenter at the third carbon of the starting material becomes the stereocenter at the fourth carbon of the lactone product. Since the reduction and lactonization steps do not alter the configuration of this stereocenter, the configuration of starting material A must be the same as the product. Therefore, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, forming a 5-hydroxyester intermediate. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) facilitates an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final lactone product. To yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
