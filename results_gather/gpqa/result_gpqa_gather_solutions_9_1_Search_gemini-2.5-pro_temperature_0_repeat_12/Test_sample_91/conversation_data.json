Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 central C + 2 methyl C's = 3\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 chain C + 1 methyl C = 2\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   C(CH3)2: 1 central C + 2 methyl C's = 3\n    *   Total C = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 chain H + 3 methyl H's = 4\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   Total H = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Write the Formation Reaction**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the enthalpy change for the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\nThe reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**3. Apply Hess's Law using Atomization Enthalpies**\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using a thermodynamic cycle involving the atomization of reactants and the formation of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n\n*   The enthalpy of atomization of the product is the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas.\n*   Atomization of Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    *   ΔH = 12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   ΔH = 11 * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (C12H22)**\n\nThis requires counting the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\nStructure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** We already counted 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon links (single, double, triple) is N-1, where N is the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Total C-C links = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since there are 2 double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nNow, sum the energies of all these bonds:\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (BE of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (BE of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (BE of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n(Note: This value matches option C, which is a common distractor. It represents the energy to break the molecule into atoms, not its enthalpy of formation).\n\n**6. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nΔHf° = [ΔH_atom(reactants)] - [ΔH_atom(product)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**7. Check the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol. Option B has the number 1900, but the unit is kJ/g, which is incorrect. We need to check the value in kJ/g.\n\nTo convert kJ/mol to kJ/g, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) ≈ 12 * (12.0 g/mol) + 22 * (1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nFinal Answer: The calculated enthalpy of formation is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\nThe structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): There are 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** Each hydrogen is bonded to a carbon, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two carbon-carbon double bonds ((CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2).\n    *   **C-C bonds:** There are 9 carbon-carbon single bonds.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We use the provided bond energies:\n*   ΔH_atomization = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n*   ΔH_atomization = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n*   ΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n*   ΔH_atomization = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\n\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements in their standard state (solid carbon and gaseous H2) into individual gaseous atoms.\nThe overall reaction for atomization of the elements is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   **For Carbon:** Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   Total enthalpy of formation for gaseous atoms (ΔH_f_atoms) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the gaseous atoms from their elements and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\n*   ΔH_f = ΔH_f_atoms - ΔH_atomization(compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n*   ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**5. Convert to the Correct Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must check the units of the given options. Options B and C are in kJ/g. To convert our answer, we need the molar mass of the compound (C12H22).\n\n*   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, we convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.44 kJ/g\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** I will first determine the chemical formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 by counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Count the Bonds:** I will carefully count the number of each type of bond (C-H, C-C, and C=C) in the molecule. I will use the valency formula `N_CC = (4*C - H - 4*N_C=C) / 2` to verify my manual count of C-C single bonds.\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound:** Using the given bond energies, I will calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. This is the sum of the energies of all bonds.\n    *   ΔH_atom(compound) = Σ (Bond Energies)\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** I will calculate the total energy required to form the constituent gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)) from their elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\n    *   ΔH_atom(H) is half the bond energy of H-H.\n    *   ΣΔH_atom(elements) = 12 * ΔH_atom(C) + 22 * ΔH_atom(H)\n5.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n6.  **Check Units and Select Answer:** The result will be in kJ/mol. I will check if this matches any option. If not, I will convert the units to kJ/g by calculating the molar mass of the compound and dividing the result by it. Then, I will compare this new value with the given options to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Step 1: Define given data and molecular properties ---\n# Given bond energies and enthalpies of atomization in kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400\nBE_CC = 200\nBE_CeqC = 300\nBE_HH = 100\ndelta_H_atom_C = 1000\n\n# The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n# Molecular Formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# --- Step 2: Count the number of each type of bond ---\n# Number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n# Number of C=C double bonds is clear from the structure\nnum_CeqC_bonds = 2\n# Number of C-C single bonds can be calculated from valency rules:\n# Sum of valencies = 4*num_C + 1*num_H = 2 * (N_CC + 2*N_C=C + N_CH)\n# 4*12 + 22 = 2 * (N_CC + 2*2 + 22) => 70 = 2 * (N_CC + 26) => 35 = N_CC + 26 => N_CC = 9\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\n\nprint(f\"Analysis of the molecule C{num_C}H{num_H}:\")\nprint(f\" -

It represents the energy to break the molecule into atoms, not its enthalpy of formation).\n\n**6. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nΔHf° = [ΔH_atom(reactants)] - [ΔH_atom(product)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**7. Check the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol. Option B has the number 1900, but the unit is kJ/g, which is incorrect. We need to check the value in kJ/g.\n\nTo convert kJ/mol to kJ/g, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) ≈ 12 * (12.0 g/mol) + 22 * (1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nFinal Answer: The calculated enthalpy of formation is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1.

Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We use the provided bond energies:\n*   ΔH_atomization = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n*   ΔH_atomization = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n*   ΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n*   ΔH_atomization = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\n\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements in their standard state (solid carbon and gaseous H2) into individual gaseous atoms.\nThe overall reaction for atomization of the elements is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   **For Carbon:** Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   Total enthalpy of formation for gaseous atoms (ΔH_f_atoms) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the gaseous atoms from their elements and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\n*   ΔH_f = ΔH_f_atoms - ΔH_atomization(compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n*   ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**5. Convert to the Correct Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must check the units of the given options. Options B and C are in kJ/g. To convert our answer, we need the molar mass of the compound (C12H22).\n\n*   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, we convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.44 kJ/g\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** I will first determine the chemical formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 by counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Count the Bonds:** I will carefully count the number of each type of bond (C-H, C-C, and C=C) in the molecule. I will use the valency formula `N_CC = (4*C - H - 4*N_C=C) / 2` to verify my manual count of C-C single bonds.\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound:** Using the given bond energies, I will calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. This is the sum of the energies of all bonds.\n    *   ΔH_atom(compound) = Σ (Bond Energies)\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** I will calculate the total energy required to form the constituent gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)) from their elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\n    *   ΔH_atom(H) is half the bond energy of H-H.\n    *   ΣΔH_atom(elements) = 12 * ΔH_atom(C) + 22 * ΔH_atom(H)\n5.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n6.  **Check Units and Select Answer:** The result will be in kJ/mol.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule from its condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break down the formula and draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds.\nThe structure is a main chain with several methyl group substituents.\nThe main chain is `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`, which is a heptadiene (7 carbons).\n*   The first carbon `(C1)` is double-bonded to `C2` and has two methyl groups attached: `(CH3)2C1=`.\n*   The chain continues with `=C2H-C3H2-`.\n*   The fourth carbon `(C4)` has a methyl group: `-C4H(CH3)-`.\n*   The chain continues with `-C5H2-C6H=`.\n*   The last carbon `(C7)` is double-bonded to `C6` and has two methyl groups attached: `=C7(CH3)2`.\n\nThe full structure is 2,4,7,7-tetramethylhepta-1,5-diene. Wait, let's re-check the name from the formula `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\nThe correct IUPAC name for the structure derived is 2,5,8,8-tetramethylnona-2,7-diene.\n\nLet's count the atoms based on the valid chemical structure:\n*   **Carbons (C):** There are 7 carbons in the main chain and 5 methyl groups attached. This gives a total of 7 + 5 = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   From `(CH3)2C=`: 6 H\n    *   From `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   From `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   From `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   From `-CH=`: 1 H\n    *   From `=C(CH3)2`: 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nFrom the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure (`C=C`).

The overall process can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** First, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (at C=) + 1 (in =CH-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 2 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in -CH=) + 3 (in =C(CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 4 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in -CH=) + 6 (in =C(CH3)2) = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Count the Chemical Bonds:** We need to determine the number of each type of bond in one mole of the substance. For an acyclic molecule like this one:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms directly gives the number of C-H bonds, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and multiple) is n-1. Here, n=12, so there are 11 total C-C framework bonds. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atomization):** This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound into gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n    *   Energy to break C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Energy to break C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy to break C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   **ΔH_atomization** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms:** This is the energy required to produce all the constituent atoms in their gaseous state from their elements in their standard states (C(graphite) and H2(gas)).\n    *   For Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   For Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which corresponds to the reaction H2(g) → 2H(g). Therefore, the enthalpy of formation of 1 mole of H(g) is 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy to form gaseous Hydrogen atoms = 22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   **Total enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation of the compound is the difference between the enthalpy of formation of the gaseous atoms and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n    *   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g:** The options include answers in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result.\n    *   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n*   A) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization)\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value is correct for kJ/mol, but the unit is wrong)\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculated value)\n*   D) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**2. Count the Bonds**\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, one at the beginning and one at the end of the main chain. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can determine the number of C-C single bonds by analyzing the structure's connectivity.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connect the first carbon to two methyl groups.\n    *   There are four C-C single bonds within the main carbon chain.\n    *   One C-C bond connects a main-chain carbon to a methyl group.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connect the last carbon to two methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nUsing the provided bond energies:\n*   Energy to break 22 C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy to break 9 C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy to break 2 C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (ΔH_atom) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4.

To get the enthalpy of formation for one mole of H atoms (½H2 → H), we take half of the bond energy.\n    *   ΔH_f(H, g) = 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    *   Enthalpy to form 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen = 22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Formation of Atoms = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5.
