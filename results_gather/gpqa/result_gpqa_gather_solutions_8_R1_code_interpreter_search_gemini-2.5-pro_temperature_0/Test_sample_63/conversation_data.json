Let's analyze the effect of each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass change = 0. This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were delivered by the gas stream.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas does not react with any of the reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the reactants are salts likely containing nitrogen (as we will see), this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The final gas is 0.10 mol of N₂. We must also account for any N₂ produced in Tube 3 if the reacting gas was N₂O.\n    *   Let's consider the two possibilities for the gas reacting in Tube 3:\n        1.  If it was O₂, then the initial gas mixture contained 0.10 mol N₂. Total N = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol.\n        2.  If it was N₂O, then 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted (since it contains 0.05 mol of O). This reaction (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would be this 0.05 mol plus 0.05 mol of N₂ that was present initially. In this case, the total nitrogen is also 0.05 mol (from N₂O) + 0.05 mol (from initial N₂) = 0.10 mol of N₂ molecules, which is 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total moles of Nitrogen atoms in the products is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contains:\n*   0.40 mol of H\n*   0.25 mol of O\n*   0.20 mol of N\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B. The combined chemical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) that are composed of N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The fact that they decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\nLet's try the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match.\n\nWe can verify this by checking the total mass.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\nThe total moles of elements (N=0.20, H=0.40, O=0.25) correspond to a total mass of 0.20*14 + 0.40*1 + 0.25*16 = 2.8 + 0.4 + 4.0 = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass.\nThe number of moles of the (N₄H₈O₅) unit is 7.20 g / (80+64) g/mol = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nSince the mixture is equimolar (n moles of A and n moles of B), the 0.05 mol of the combined unit corresponds to 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B. This is consistent with all the data derived in the first steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a strong dehydrating agent, limewater, or hot copper, it is likely nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Verify the composition and identify the salts\n\nLet's summarize the decomposition products:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂)\n\nLet's check the total mass of these products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture, which confirms our identification of the products and their quantities. The original salts must therefore be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nThe production of N₂, H₂O, and O₂ upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of certain ammonium salts. The most common salts that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₂ = x\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = x\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reactions, we can calculate the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total H₂O:** (2 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (4/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** 0 from NH₄NO₂ + (1/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 0.5x\n*   **Total N₂:** (1 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (2/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = x + x = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the moles of products we calculated earlier to find 'x':\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol  => x = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation).\n*   From N₂: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. Let's also verify the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g.\nThis is consistent with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of atoms\n\nThe salts have been correctly identified as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** We'll start by using the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with oxygen (O₂), forming CuO. This increase is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which passed through all tubes unreacted, can be identified by calculating its molar mass from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). We'll also verify the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O₂, and gas C, we can calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original mixture. This will give us the overall empirical formula for the combined salts (A+B).\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The problem states that A and B are salts that decompose into only gaseous products. The presence of H₂O and N₂ as products strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can deduce the specific formulas of the two ammonium salts (A and B) that would combine to match the overall empirical formula we found.\n\n4.  **Verify the Identification:** We will use the total initial mass (7.20 g) and the fact that the mixture is equimolar to confirm that our identified salts are correct. We'll calculate the moles of the mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, we will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60      # g, from tube #1\nmass_O2 = 0.80       # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of each product\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Check conservation of mass to identify gas C\n# Assuming gas C is N2, let's calculate its mass\nmass_gas_C_assumed_N2 = moles_gas_C * M_N2\ntotal_product_mass = mass_H2O + mass_O2 + mass_gas_C_assumed_N2\n\n# The total product mass (7.20 g) matches the initial mixture mass.\n# This confirms that gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture\n# Calculate total moles of each element from the products\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the mixture is H:N:O\n# H : N : O  ~=  0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n# To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8:4:5.\n# So the overall formula of (A+B) is H8N4O5.\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# The products (N2, H2O) suggest ammonium salts.\n# The overall formula H8N4O5 contains 8 H atoms, which corresponds to two ammonium ions, (NH4)2.\n# (NH4)2 = N2H8.\n# Subtracting this from the total formula leaves the anions: H8N4O5 - N2H8 = N2O5.\n# The two anions must sum to N2O5. The most common and logical choice is nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).\n# So, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\n\n# Step 4: Verify the Identification (optional but good practice)\nM_NH4NO3 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 3*M_O\nM_NH4NO2 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 2*M_O\n# Moles of mixture n = mass_mixture / (M_NH4NO3 + M_NH4NO2)\n# n = 7.20 / (80.04 + 64.04) = 7.20 / 144.08 ~= 0.05 mol.\n# This is consistent with our product moles:\n# moles_O2 = 0.025 mol (from 0.05 mol NH4NO3)\n# moles_N2 = 0.05 (from NH4NO3) + 0.05 (from NH4NO2) = 0.1 mol\n# moles_H2O = 0.1 (from NH4NO3) + 0.1 (from NH4NO2) = 0.2 mol\n# The identification is correct.\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO3\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3  # N + H4 + N + O3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2  # N + H4 + N + O2\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Salt A is identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of A: {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Salt B is identified as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of B: {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n\n# Match with options\noptions = {'A': 13, 'B': 17, 'C': 19, 'D': 15}\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_atoms:\n        final_answer = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {final_answer}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Salt A is identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\nNumber of atoms in one formula unit of A: 9\nSalt B is identified as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\nNumber of atoms in one formula unit of B: 8\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: 17\nThis corresponds to option B.\nFinal Answer: B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe mixture of gases formed by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial point: it means **no acidic gases** were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents. Given that the original salts are likely nitrogen compounds (a common theme in such problems), and no other elements are suggested, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nThe decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nWe can find the total moles of each element (H, O, N) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the composition and find the formulas of the salts.**\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and also the number of moles of salt B.\nThe total moles of elements can be expressed as:\n*   n × (N atoms in A + N atoms in B) = 0.20 mol\n*   n × (H atoms in A + H atoms in B) = 0.40 mol\n*   n × (O atoms in A + O atoms in B) = 0.25 mol\n\nFrom these equations, the ratio of the total number of atoms in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The H:N ratio in the ammonium ion is 4:1. In our combined formula, the H:N ratio is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. However, if we consider that we have two salt molecules, we can propose that each contains one ammonium cation, NH₄⁺.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions would account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ leaves N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common oxyanions of nitrogen. The most plausible combination is the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n    *   NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻ (in terms of atoms)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**Step 4: Verify the decomposition reactions and molar masses.**\nLet's check if this identification is consistent with all the data.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition at higher temperatures: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This simplifies to: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles, n.\nTotal mass = n × (Molar Mass of A) + n × (Molar Mass of B) = 7.20 g\nn × (64 + 80) = 7.20\nn × 144 = 7.20\nn = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's check the products from this mixture:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05 × ½) = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05 × 2) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Correct)\n*   H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n*   O₂ = 0.025 mol (Correct)\nAll calculated values match the experimental results.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, using the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ we found in Step 3:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the same problem again. The previous reasoning and code execution have already confirmed the solution. I will reiterate the final steps of the reasoning.\n\n**1. Identification of Salts:**\nBased on the products of decomposition (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂), the salts were identified as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Decomposition of Salt A (NH₄NO₃): NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n*   Decomposition of Salt B (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n**2. Verification of Moles and Mass:**\nThe analysis of the gas mixture showed that 0.05 moles of N₂O and 0.05 moles of N₂ were produced. Since the initial mixture was equimolar, this means the original mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms:**\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Weight increase = mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that **no CO₂** or other acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nNow, let's determine the mass and moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by looking at the atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = **0.4 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = **0.2 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n*   Mass ≈ 0.4032 g + 2.8014 g + 4.00 g = 7.2046 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming our calculations and the identity of gas C as N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means if we have 'n' moles of salt A, we also have 'n' moles of salt B. The total amount of the mixture contains 0.2 mol N, 0.4 mol H, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are decomposition products containing N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like nitrate or nitrite). Let's try to find two such salts that sum to the formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxygen must have come from a gaseous oxide that is not acidic and reacts with hot copper. The two common possibilities are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂). However, the problem states that a gas C remained *after* this tube. If the gas were O₂, it would be consumed, and it's unlikely that the initial mixture contained elemental nitrogen. A more plausible scenario is the reaction of N₂O with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO.\n    *   Therefore, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is the nitrogen (N₂) that passed through all the tubes. It consists of any N₂ produced directly from the decomposition plus the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂ (original) + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (original) + 0.05 mol\n    *   So, the amount of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition is **0.05 mol**.\n\nTo summarize, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products is:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g\n\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that the salts decomposed completely into these gaseous products.\n\nThe salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were heated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`n`A + `n`B → 0.05 N₂ + 0.05 N₂O + 0.20 H₂O\n\nDividing the product moles by the smallest value (0.05) gives a ratio of 1 N₂ : 1 N₂O : 4 H₂O.\nThis suggests that the decomposition of one mole of A and one mole of B produces 1 mole of N₂, 1 mole of N₂O, and 4 moles of H₂O.\nLet's look for two common nitrogen-containing salts whose decomposition products match this. The most common salts that produce these gases are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, their combined decomposition is:\nNH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + N₂O + 4H₂O\n\nThis perfectly matches the 1:1:4 molar ratio of the products we deduced. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nLet's verify the moles. The reaction `n`A + `n`B produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (or B): Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (or A): Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in NH₄NO₂) + (Atoms in NH₄NO₃) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the moles of the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N/mol N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol O₂)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass of the mixture:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B. The total moles of elements are the sum from both salts.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get integers, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N: 1, H: 2, O: 1.25. Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\nLet's try combining ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃ → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂ → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nSum of formulas = (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This matches our derived ratio.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the decomposition reactions. The thermal decomposition of these salts at around 200°C produces the observed gases:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g) (This is the primary reaction, but at higher temperatures or with impurities, it can also produce N₂ and O₂). A more complete decomposition that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂.\n\nLet's assume the reactions are:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O + 0.5n O₂\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we have 0.10 mol N₂, 0.20 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. We can identify the gaseous products and their quantities by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change. This implies that no CO₂ (or other acidic gas) was formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper (Cu) reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight (0.80 g) is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the gas mixture passes through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remain. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most common inert gas produced in chemical decompositions of nitrogen-containing compounds is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identified products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo get all integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must correspond to the empirical formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the identity of gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar mass of C = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nThe elements present in the products are H (from H₂O), O (from H₂O and O₂), and the elements from gas C. Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no carbon. A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This is a perfect match.\n\nSo, the gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the overall stoichiometry of the decomposition.**\n\nWe have the molar amounts of all products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest value (0.025):\n*   N₂ : 0.10 / 0.025 = 4\n*   O₂ : 0.025 / 0.025 = 1\n*   H₂O : 0.20 / 0.025 = 8\n\nThe overall stoichiometric ratio of the products is 4N₂ : 1O₂ : 8H₂O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means they must be composed of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The most common candidates are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  *(Note: This decomposition occurs at higher temperatures, consistent with the production of O₂)*\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's assume we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `n/2`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nThe molar ratio of the products from this mixture is (2n) : (n/2) : (4n). Multiplying by 2 to clear the fraction gives 4 : 1 : 8. This perfectly matches the ratio we derived from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the number of atoms.**\n\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n*   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly verify the initial mass using the value of `n`. From the product data, we know that 0.025 moles of O₂ were produced.\n*   Moles of O₂ = `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent and all data points are satisfied.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. The change in weight of each tube tells us what was absorbed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water, we use its molar mass (≈18.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it means **no CO₂ was produced**. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain the element Carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in the tube's mass is due to the captured oxygen.\n    *   The mass of O₂ produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   To find the moles of oxygen, we use its molar mass (32.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, and we know the salts don't contain carbon, the most plausible identity for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThis total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms our products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements **Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O)**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have the molar ratio of the elements in the entire mixture: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n*   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must be **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a classic stoichiometry problem that can be solved by carefully analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the mass change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is non-reactive towards water absorbers, bases, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Volume of N₂ = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\n### 2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify the Salts\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products should equal the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Gases** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct. The decomposition of salts A and B yields H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen points towards ammonium salts, and the presence of oxygen suggests nitrate or nitrite anions.\n\nLet's examine the decomposition of likely candidates:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can be complex. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states it's an equimolar mixture. Let's assume salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Let 'x' be the number of moles for each salt.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `x` moles of N₂, `0.5x` moles of O₂, and `2x` moles of H₂O (based on the second reaction, per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = x + x = 2x\n*   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5x\n\nThe molar ratio of the products is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 2x : 4x : 0.5x, which simplifies to **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental ratio from Step 1:\n*   N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.1 mol : 0.2 mol : 0.025 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025), we get the ratio **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, and the change in mass of each tube tells us what gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which would form a precipitate. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced water, a non-reactive gas (C), and an oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. The presence of nitrogen in many thermally unstable salts, along with the products, suggests the gases are related to nitrogen compounds.\n\n*   The most common non-reactive gas produced in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n*   The oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper (providing 0.05 mol of O atoms) and would likely produce N₂ as a byproduct is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   From this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would produce the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that formed CuO. This reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂.\n*   The total amount of N₂ (Gas C) collected was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ came from the reaction of N₂O with copper, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition.\n\nSo, the gases formed by heating the salts were:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of specific ammonium salts.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's assume Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**. The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar (contained an equal number of moles of each salt). Let's verify if this matches our findings.\n\n*   Let 'x' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₃ produces x moles of N₂O and 2x moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₂ produces x moles of N₂ and 2x moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x\n*   Moles of N₂ = x\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n\nFrom our analysis in step 2, we found:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol   => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => 4x = 4(0.05) = 0.20 mol\n\nThe values are consistent. Therefore, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases. We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol):\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc., and indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass increased by 0.80 g.\n    *   This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Using the molar mass of oxygen atoms (O ≈ 16.0 g/mol):\n        Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This means the gas passing through this tube delivered 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. This could have been O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of the final gas, N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The total elemental content (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) comes from an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula for one molecule of salt A plus one molecule of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Let's analyze the effect of each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass change = 0. This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were delivered by the gas stream.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas does not react with any of the reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the reactants are salts likely containing nitrogen (as we will see), this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The final gas is 0.10 mol of N₂. We must also account for any N₂ produced in Tube 3 if the reacting gas was N₂O.\n    *   Let's consider the two possibilities for the gas reacting in Tube 3:\n        1.  If it was O₂, then the initial gas mixture contained 0.10 mol N₂. Total N = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol.\n        2.  If it was N₂O, then 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted (since it contains 0.05 mol of O). This reaction (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would be this 0.05 mol plus 0.05 mol of N₂ that was present initially. In this case, the total nitrogen is also 0.05 mol (from N₂O) + 0.05 mol (from initial N₂) = 0.10 mol of N₂ molecules, which is 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total moles of Nitrogen atoms in the products is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contains:\n*   0.40 mol of H\n*   0.25 mol of O\n*   0.20 mol of N\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B. The combined chemical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) that are composed of N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The fact that they decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\nLet's try the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match.\n\nWe can verify this by checking the total mass.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\nThe total moles of elements (N=0.20, H=0.40, O=0.25) correspond to a total mass of 0.20*14 + 0.40*1 + 0.25*16 = 2.8 + 0.4 + 4.0 = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass.\nThe number of moles of the (N₄H₈O₅) unit is 7.20 g / (80+64) g/mol = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nSince the mixture is equimolar (n moles of A and n moles of B), the 0.05 mol of the combined unit corresponds to 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B. This is consistent with all the data derived in the first steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a strong dehydrating agent, limewater, or hot copper, it is likely nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Verify the composition and identify the salts\n\nLet's summarize the decomposition products:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂)\n\nLet's check the total mass of these products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture, which confirms our identification of the products and their quantities. The original salts must therefore be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nThe production of N₂, H₂O, and O₂ upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of certain ammonium salts. The most common salts that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₂ = x\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = x\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reactions, we can calculate the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total H₂O:** (2 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (4/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** 0 from NH₄NO₂ + (1/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 0.5x\n*   **Total N₂:** (1 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (2/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = x + x = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the moles of products we calculated earlier to find 'x':\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol  => x = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation).\n*   From N₂: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. Let's also verify the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g.\nThis is consistent with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of atoms\n\nThe salts have been correctly identified as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** We'll start by using the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with oxygen (O₂), forming CuO. This increase is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which passed through all tubes unreacted, can be identified by calculating its molar mass from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). We'll also verify the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O₂, and gas C, we can calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original mixture. This will give us the overall empirical formula for the combined salts (A+B).\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The problem states that A and B are salts that decompose into only gaseous products. The presence of H₂O and N₂ as products strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can deduce the specific formulas of the two ammonium salts (A and B) that would combine to match the overall empirical formula we found.\n\n4.  **Verify the Identification:** We will use the total initial mass (7.20 g) and the fact that the mixture is equimolar to confirm that our identified salts are correct. We'll calculate the moles of the mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, we will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60      # g, from tube #1\nmass_O2 = 0.80       # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of each product\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Check conservation of mass to identify gas C\n# Assuming gas C is N2, let's calculate its mass\nmass_gas_C_assumed_N2 = moles_gas_C * M_N2\ntotal_product_mass = mass_H2O + mass_O2 + mass_gas_C_assumed_N2\n\n# The total product mass (7.20 g) matches the initial mixture mass.\n# This confirms that gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture\n# Calculate total moles of each element from the products\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the mixture is H:N:O\n# H : N : O  ~=  0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n# To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8:4:5.\n# So the overall formula of (A+B) is H8N4O5.\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# The products (N2, H2O) suggest ammonium salts.\n# The overall formula H8N4O5 contains 8 H atoms, which corresponds to two ammonium ions, (NH4)2.\n# (NH4)2 = N2H8.\n# Subtracting this from the total formula leaves the anions: H8N4O5 - N2H8 = N2O5.\n# The two anions must sum to N2O5.

This is a crucial point: it means **no acidic gases** were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents. Given that the original salts are likely nitrogen compounds (a common theme in such problems), and no other elements are suggested, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nThe decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nWe can find the total moles of each element (H, O, N) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the composition and find the formulas of the salts.**\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and also the number of moles of salt B.\nThe total moles of elements can be expressed as:\n*   n × (N atoms in A + N atoms in B) = 0.20 mol\n*   n × (H atoms in A + H atoms in B) = 0.40 mol\n*   n × (O atoms in A + O atoms in B) = 0.25 mol\n\nFrom these equations, the ratio of the total number of atoms in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The H:N ratio in the ammonium ion is 4:1. In our combined formula, the H:N ratio is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. However, if we consider that we have two salt molecules, we can propose that each contains one ammonium cation, NH₄⁺.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions would account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ leaves N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common oxyanions of nitrogen. The most plausible combination is the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n    *   NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻ (in terms of atoms)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**Step 4: Verify the decomposition reactions and molar masses.**\nLet's check if this identification is consistent with all the data.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition at higher temperatures: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This simplifies to: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles, n.\nTotal mass = n × (Molar Mass of A) + n × (Molar Mass of B) = 7.20 g\nn × (64 + 80) = 7.20\nn × 144 = 7.20\nn = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's check the products from this mixture:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05 × ½) = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05 × 2) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Correct)\n*   H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n*   O₂ = 0.025 mol (Correct)\nAll calculated values match the experimental results.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, using the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ we found in Step 3:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the same problem again. The previous reasoning and code execution have already confirmed the solution. I will reiterate the final steps of the reasoning.\n\n**1. Identification of Salts:**\nBased on the products of decomposition (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂), the salts were identified as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Decomposition of Salt A (NH₄NO₃): NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n*   Decomposition of Salt B (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n**2. Verification of Moles and Mass:**\nThe analysis of the gas mixture showed that 0.05 moles of N₂O and 0.05 moles of N₂ were produced. Since the initial mixture was equimolar, this means the original mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms:**\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Weight increase = mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that **no CO₂** or other acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nNow, let's determine the mass and moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by looking at the atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = **0.4 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = **0.2 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n*   Mass ≈ 0.4032 g + 2.8014 g + 4.00 g = 7.2046 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming our calculations and the identity of gas C as N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means if we have 'n' moles of salt A, we also have 'n' moles of salt B. The total amount of the mixture contains 0.2 mol N, 0.4 mol H, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are decomposition products containing N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like nitrate or nitrite). Let's try to find two such salts that sum to the formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxygen must have come from a gaseous oxide that is not acidic and reacts with hot copper. The two common possibilities are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂). However, the problem states that a gas C remained *after* this tube. If the gas were O₂, it would be consumed, and it's unlikely that the initial mixture contained elemental nitrogen. A more plausible scenario is the reaction of N₂O with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO.\n    *   Therefore, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is the nitrogen (N₂) that passed through all the tubes. It consists of any N₂ produced directly from the decomposition plus the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂ (original) + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (original) + 0.05 mol\n    *   So, the amount of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition is **0.05 mol**.\n\nTo summarize, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products is:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g\n\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that the salts decomposed completely into these gaseous products.\n\nThe salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were heated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`n`A + `n`B → 0.05 N₂ + 0.05 N₂O + 0.20 H₂O\n\nDividing the product moles by the smallest value (0.05) gives a ratio of 1 N₂ : 1 N₂O : 4 H₂O.\nThis suggests that the decomposition of one mole of A and one mole of B produces 1 mole of N₂, 1 mole of N₂O, and 4 moles of H₂O.\nLet's look for two common nitrogen-containing salts whose decomposition products match this. The most common salts that produce these gases are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, their combined decomposition is:\nNH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + N₂O + 4H₂O\n\nThis perfectly matches the 1:1:4 molar ratio of the products we deduced. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nLet's verify the moles. The reaction `n`A + `n`B produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (or B): Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (or A): Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in NH₄NO₂) + (Atoms in NH₄NO₃) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the moles of the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N/mol N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol O₂)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass of the mixture:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B. The total moles of elements are the sum from both salts.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get integers, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N: 1, H: 2, O: 1.25. Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\nLet's try combining ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃ → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂ → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nSum of formulas = (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This matches our derived ratio.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the decomposition reactions. The thermal decomposition of these salts at around 200°C produces the observed gases:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g) (This is the primary reaction, but at higher temperatures or with impurities, it can also produce N₂ and O₂). A more complete decomposition that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂.\n\nLet's assume the reactions are:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O + 0.5n O₂\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we have 0.10 mol N₂, 0.20 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. We can identify the gaseous products and their quantities by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change. This implies that no CO₂ (or other acidic gas) was formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper (Cu) reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight (0.80 g) is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the gas mixture passes through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remain. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most common inert gas produced in chemical decompositions of nitrogen-containing compounds is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identified products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo get all integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must correspond to the empirical formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the identity of gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar mass of C = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nThe elements present in the products are H (from H₂O), O (from H₂O and O₂), and the elements from gas C. Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no carbon. A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This is a perfect match.\n\nSo, the gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the overall stoichiometry of the decomposition.**\n\nWe have the molar amounts of all products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest value (0.025):\n*   N₂ : 0.10 / 0.025 = 4\n*   O₂ : 0.025 / 0.025 = 1\n*   H₂O : 0.20 / 0.025 = 8\n\nThe overall stoichiometric ratio of the products is 4N₂ : 1O₂ : 8H₂O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means they must be composed of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The most common candidates are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  *(Note: This decomposition occurs at higher temperatures, consistent with the production of O₂)*\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's assume we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `n/2`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nThe molar ratio of the products from this mixture is (2n) : (n/2) : (4n). Multiplying by 2 to clear the fraction gives 4 : 1 : 8. This perfectly matches the ratio we derived from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the number of atoms.**\n\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n*   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly verify the initial mass using the value of `n`. From the product data, we know that 0.025 moles of O₂ were produced.\n*   Moles of O₂ = `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent and all data points are satisfied.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. The change in weight of each tube tells us what was absorbed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water, we use its molar mass (≈18.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it means **no CO₂ was produced**. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain the element Carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in the tube's mass is due to the captured oxygen.\n    *   The mass of O₂ produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   To find the moles of oxygen, we use its molar mass (32.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, and we know the salts don't contain carbon, the most plausible identity for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThis total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms our products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements **Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O)**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have the molar ratio of the elements in the entire mixture: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n*   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must be **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a classic stoichiometry problem that can be solved by carefully analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the mass change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is non-reactive towards water absorbers, bases, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Volume of N₂ = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\n### 2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify the Salts\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products should equal the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Gases** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct. The decomposition of salts A and B yields H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen points towards ammonium salts, and the presence of oxygen suggests nitrate or nitrite anions.\n\nLet's examine the decomposition of likely candidates:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can be complex. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states it's an equimolar mixture. Let's assume salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Let 'x' be the number of moles for each salt.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `x` moles of N₂, `0.5x` moles of O₂, and `2x` moles of H₂O (based on the second reaction, per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = x + x = 2x\n*   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5x\n\nThe molar ratio of the products is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 2x : 4x : 0.5x, which simplifies to **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental ratio from Step 1:\n*   N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.1 mol : 0.2 mol : 0.025 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025), we get the ratio **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, and the change in mass of each tube tells us what gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which would form a precipitate. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced water, a non-reactive gas (C), and an oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. The presence of nitrogen in many thermally unstable salts, along with the products, suggests the gases are related to nitrogen compounds.\n\n*   The most common non-reactive gas produced in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n*   The oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper (providing 0.05 mol of O atoms) and would likely produce N₂ as a byproduct is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   From this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would produce the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that formed CuO. This reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂.\n*   The total amount of N₂ (Gas C) collected was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ came from the reaction of N₂O with copper, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition.\n\nSo, the gases formed by heating the salts were:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of specific ammonium salts.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's assume Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**. The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar (contained an equal number of moles of each salt). Let's verify if this matches our findings.\n\n*   Let 'x' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₃ produces x moles of N₂O and 2x moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₂ produces x moles of N₂ and 2x moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x\n*   Moles of N₂ = x\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n\nFrom our analysis in step 2, we found:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol   => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => 4x = 4(0.05) = 0.20 mol\n\nThe values are consistent. Therefore, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
