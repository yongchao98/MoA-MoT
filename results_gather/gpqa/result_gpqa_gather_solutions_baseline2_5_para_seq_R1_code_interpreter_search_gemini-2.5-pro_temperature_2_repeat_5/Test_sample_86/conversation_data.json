This molecule has 7 total protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group), which must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce the Isomer**\n\nThe arrangement of the substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is crucial. The data presented in the options provides a major clue to solve this.\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** A key pattern visible in the correct option's aromatic region is two signals, both of which are **doublets (d)** that integrate to **two protons (2H)** each. This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry in this isomer results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into two clean doublets, simplifying the spectrum significantly.\n*   **Predicting the Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The signals will be downfield (high ppm value, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the 2.1-2.6 ppm range.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm. We will now systematically evaluate the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match. It shows the two doublets (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) for a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3 (3H, s)` signal for the acetyl methyl group. The total proton count (2+2+3 = 7H) is correct for the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the spectrum is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde structure; the adjacent aldehyde proton and methylene protons would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (> 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Deduction:** The foundational step is to correctly combine all pieces of information (carbon count, functional groups, core structure) to arrive at the correct molecular class (haloacetophenone).\n2.  **Using Answer Options to Infer Isomerism:** A key analytical skill is using the simplicity of the NMR options (specifically, the clean two-doublet pattern) to infer the correct isomer (*para*) without having to predict the complex spectra for the *ortho* and *meta* alternatives.\n3.  **Cross-Validating Functional Groups:** It is essential to check for consistency. The presence of a peak at ~9.9 ppm (Option C) is a clear contradiction to the acetyl group (-COCH₃) deduced from the problem's clues.\n4.  **Confirming Internal Consistency:** A spectrum must not only match the proposed structure but also be chemically plausible on its own. Option C fails this test because its side-chain splitting pattern violates basic coupling rules.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** A final check on the total proton count (integration) ensures that the spectrum matches the molecular formula. The sum of protons in option B (2+2+3) is 7, matching the C₈H₇XO structure perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the consensus chemical reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying it rigorously to the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information provided in the question to determine the identity of the unknown compound. This reasoning is consistent and correct across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached. A key detail is that this ring will have 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Putting these clues together:**\n1.  One substituent is a halogen (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br). This group contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  **Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of the Second Substituent.** The most common and chemically stable group with the composition C₂H₃O and containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns presented in the options to determine the specific isomer without ambiguity.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** The NMR data in option B, `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, shows a highly characteristic pattern of two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This simple and symmetrical pattern is a textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Other isomers (*ortho* or *meta*) would produce more complex, multi-peak splitting patterns.\n\nWith the structure confidently identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the -CH₃ group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Option against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Recognizing Aromatic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2+2+3=7H) correctly matches the 7 protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region, and the other integrations are incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 5: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** This spectrum can be rejected on two grounds. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is diagnostic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even for the corresponding aldehyde structure, the splitting pattern shown is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, not the two singlets shown.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidates and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound. This analysis is unanimously agreed upon by all the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached. A key implication is that there are 4 hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring itself.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nAssembling these facts leads to one logical conclusion for the substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, and it has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomerism**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer choices to determine the specific arrangement.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** Option D shows a highly symmetrical and characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, each integrating to **two protons (2H)** (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`). This simple pattern is a textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into clean doublets. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, less-symmetrical splitting patterns.\n\nWith the structure confidently identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm), each integrating to **2H**.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option from the original prompt against our prediction of two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, which contradicts the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the splitting pattern for the side chain (two singlets) is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum completely lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the candidate answers to ensure a robust conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound.\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" An aromatic ring (benzene) has 6 carbons, which leaves 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nCombining these clues allows us to deduce the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most stable and common chemical group with this composition (-C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that will be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n*   **Inferring Isomerism:** The spectral data in option (A) shows a highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two clean doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** With the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm), each integrating to **2H**. This is due to the two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring splitting each other.\n    2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, with a typical chemical shift around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match. It shows the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, all at characteristic chemical shifts. The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is correct.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone functional group we deduced. This option also describes a chemically flawed spectrum (the side-chain protons would split each other, not appear as two singlets).\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one in the aromatic region.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** All information (carbon count, ring type, functional groups) must be logically combined to determine the correct molecular class (haloacetophenone) and formula (C₈H₇XO).\n2.  **Using Spectral Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** A simple, symmetric splitting pattern in the aromatic region, such as `(2H, d), (2H, d)`, is a powerful clue that points directly to a para-substituted ring, bypassing the need to consider more complex isomers.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** It is vital to know characteristic chemical shift regions. A peak at ~9.9 ppm is a strong indicator of an aldehyde, while a peak at ~2.3 ppm is very common for an acetyl methyl group. Peaks from ~6.5-8.5 ppm belong to aromatic protons.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A candidate spectrum should be chemically plausible. A spectrum showing adjacent protons that don't split each other (as in the side chain of option C) violates basic coupling rules and can be dismissed.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular structure. In this case, the total must be 7H.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information from the question to identify the compound.\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic (benzene) ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** Spectroscopy confirms an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen atom, -X, is attached to the ring) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This contributes **0 carbons**.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining **2 carbons** and the **carbonyl group**. The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, meaning there are a total of 7 protons to account for in the ¹H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. The spectral data in the options provides a strong clue to the correct arrangement.\n*   **Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum:** A key pattern visible in the options is a set of two distinct signals in the aromatic region (downfield), both of which are **doublets (d)** that each integrate to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm), each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group's methyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. Their signal will be a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the aliphatic region, typically around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option provided in the question based on our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3` singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integrations (2+2+3=7H) are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one in the correct region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum is flawed for two reasons. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would have to split each other's signals, but they are incorrectly shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path to the answer is to first deduce the molecular structure (para-haloacetophenone) by systematically combining all clues from the question (carbon count, ring type, functional groups).\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The `two 2H doublets` pattern in the aromatic region is a critical shortcut that points directly to a para-substituted ring, simplifying the problem significantly.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The singlet around ~2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while the peak at ~9.9 ppm in option D is a clear indicator of a different functional group (aldehyde) and allows for its immediate rejection.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A correct answer must be chemically plausible in all respects. Option D fails this test because it shows protons on adjacent carbons that are not split, violating fundamental NMR coupling rules.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H) must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular formula (C₈H₇XO), providing a final confirmation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate agents and highlighting key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the clues from the question to identify the chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups. This means there must be 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.** We can logically determine the two substituents by combining these clues:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**. The most stable and common chemical group that fits this -C₂H₃O description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.** The spectral data in Option A shows a highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the specific isomer.\n\nWith the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield, > 7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One signal, which is a **singlet (s)** because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting. It will integrate to **3H** and have a characteristic chemical shift around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic). We will now rigorously check all four options.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It contains the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and total integration (2+2+3=7H) are all correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Verifying Aromatic Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Contradictory Functional Groups and Flawed Splitting.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other (into a triplet and a doublet), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 5: Recognizing Required Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum is missing any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this compound.\n\n**Final Decision**\nThe systematic analysis of the problem overwhelmingly supports the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The ¹H NMR data provided in option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in every aspect: chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus chemical reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting key points for a robust conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nThe first step is to use all the clues in the problem description to determine the exact chemical structure of the compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself provides 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy reveals two key functional groups: an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen atom, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, such as Cl, Br). This substituent contributes **0 carbons**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbons** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  The most common and stable chemical group with the formula -C₂H₃O is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer Isomerism**\n\nNext, we must predict what the spectrum should look like. The substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is critical, and the answer choices provide a definitive clue.\n\n*   **Inferring the Isomer from Spectral Patterns:** A highly characteristic pattern appears in the correct answer: two signals in the aromatic region that are both **doublets (d)** and each integrate to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**, in the downfield region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl methyl group (-CH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Their signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**, with a characteristic chemical shift around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now systematically compare our prediction—`two 2H doublets (aromatic) + one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`—against the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring, the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, and all signals are in the expected chemical shift regions. The total integration (2+2+3 = 7H) is correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm) and thus cannot represent the described molecule.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is diagnostic for an aldehyde, not the ketone functional group we deduced. Furthermore, the signal for the aliphatic group (-CH₂-) should be adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO) in the corresponding isomer, meaning they would split each other, not appear as two separate singlets. This makes the spectrum chemically impossible.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path to the answer is to first combine all clues (carbon count, ring type, functional groups) to deduce the molecular structure of *para*-haloacetophenone before analyzing the spectra.\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a powerful clue that immediately identifies the highly symmetrical *para* isomer, simplifying the problem and eliminating the need to predict the more complex spectra of *ortho* or *meta* isomers.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The signal at ~2.3 ppm is characteristic of a methyl ketone (-COCH₃), while the signal at ~9.9 ppm (in option D) is a clear red flag for a different functional group (an aldehyde).\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A correct spectrum must be chemically sound. Option D can be dismissed not only for having the wrong functional group but also because its splitting pattern (two singlets for an adjacent -CH₂-CHO group) violates the fundamental rules of proton coupling.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** Always perform a final check by summing the integration values. For option A, the sum is 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H, which perfectly matches the number of protons in the deduced C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning and identifying key points for an accurate conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the compound from the information provided.\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" indicating a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄XY).\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" and a \"carbonyl group (C=O).\"\n\n**Assembling the structure based on these clues:**\n1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  The most common and stable chemical group with the formula -C₂H₃O and containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer\n\nThe substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. A critical step is using the provided answer choices to determine the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Using Spectral Patterns to Infer Isomerism.** The spectral data in option A shows a highly symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This clean `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern is a classic, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The molecule's high degree of symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into simple doublets.\n\nWith the compound identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can confidently predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ > 7.0 ppm), with each signal integrating to **2H**.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** This signal will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, as there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting. Its characteristic chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It has two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and a 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, all within the expected chemical shift regions.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Verifying Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** This option is wrong for two reasons. First, the signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even for the corresponding aldehyde, the splitting pattern is chemically impossible. The adjacent -CH₂- and -CHO protons would split each other, but they are shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe logical analysis of the provided information leads unequivocally to the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The ¹H NMR data presented in option A is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure. All candidate agents followed this step correctly.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic ring (benzene) itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.** This information allows for a logical deduction of the two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. The patterns in the answer options allow us to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.**\nThe splitting pattern `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` appears in the provided options. This pattern of **two clean doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Ortho and meta isomers would produce more complex, less symmetrical splitting patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this structure in mind, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic). We will now evaluate the options from the specific question provided.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Diagnostic Chemical Shifts.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone functional group we deduced. This option describes a different molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n**Final Decision Synthesis**\nThe candidate answers show a unanimous agreement on the chemical reasoning: the compound is para-haloacetophenone, and its spectrum should consist of two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet in the appropriate regions. The inconsistency in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicates that the options were randomized in the versions of the question they reviewed. Applying the consensus reasoning to the specific question provided here leads to a single, unambiguous answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting the crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound. The reasoning for this step is universally agreed upon by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" A benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of the Structure.** We can combine these facts logically:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this C₂H₃O composition is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that will be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.** The splitting pattern in option (D) shows two distinct signals in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, multi-peak splitting patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this structure in mind, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`), and the integrations are inconsistent with our structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Diagnostic Chemical Shifts.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. **Careful Point 4: Checking for Chemical Inconsistency.** Even for the corresponding aldehyde, the spectrum is flawed. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 5: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidates and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information from the question to deduce the compound's structure.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" indicating a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄XY). A di-substituted ring will have 4 hydrogens directly attached to it.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself provides 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nCombining these clues allows for a logical deduction of the structure:\n1.  One substituent is a halogen (-X). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  The most stable and common chemical group with the composition -C₂H₃O is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there are 7 total hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be in an *ortho*-, *meta*-, or *para*- arrangement. The patterns in the answer choices provide a definitive clue to identify the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** Option A presents a highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, and each integrating to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons that split each other into clean doublets, unlike the more complex patterns expected from *ortho* or *meta* isomers.\n\nWith the compound identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two doublets in the downfield region (high ppm value), each integrating to 2H.\n*   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets` in the aromatic region plus `one 3H singlet` in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match. It contains two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6 ppm`) for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring, and a singlet (`2.3 ppm`) for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All shifts, integrations (2+2+3=7H), and splitting patterns are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically δ > 6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum describes a different functional group (the peak at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an aldehyde) and is internally inconsistent, as the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other, not appear as two singlets.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider for Solving**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path is to systematically combine all clues (carbon count, functional groups, ring type) to build the molecular structure of haloacetophenone before interpreting the NMR data.\n2.  **Using the Answers to Inform the Question:** The simple splitting patterns presented in the options are a powerful clue. Recognizing the \"two 2H doublets\" pattern as the signature of a *para* isomer is the key insight that unlocks the problem without needing to consider more complex isomers.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** It is crucial to know characteristic chemical shift ranges. A peak near 2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while a peak near 10 ppm is a definitive marker for an aldehyde, allowing for quick elimination of incorrect options.\n4.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** A quick sum of the integration values (the `xH` numbers) should always match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular formula (C₈H₇XO has 7 protons). Only option A has a valid pattern that integrates to 7H.\n5.  **Checking for Chemical Consistency:** Even if an option seems plausible, check that the splitting patterns obey chemical rules (like the n+1 rule). Option D fails this test because adjacent protons shown as singlets violate coupling rules, making it a classic \"distractor\" answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on a synthesis of the candidate agents' reasoning and a careful evaluation of the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound. This process was performed correctly and unanimously by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" A benzene ring accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.**\nBy combining these facts, we can logically determine the two substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns presented in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.**\nThe splitting pattern shown in option (B), `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, less symmetrical splitting patterns. This strong clue allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this specific structure identified, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` and `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Inconsistent Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is diagnostic for an **aldehyde** proton, not the ketone functional group we deduced. Furthermore, this spectrum is internally inconsistent, as the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons of the corresponding isomer would split each other, not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Recognizing the Required Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information provided in the question to determine the identity of the compound. This is the foundational step and all candidate answers performed it correctly.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates the presence of a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (meaning a halogen atom is attached directly to the ring).\n\nPutting these clues together:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl or -Br). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**. The simplest and most stable chemical structure fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there are a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce the Isomer\n\nNext, we must predict the spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is key, and the options themselves provide the most significant clue.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** A key analytical technique is to observe the splitting patterns offered in the answers. Option C shows a distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, both of which are **doublets (d)** that integrate to **two protons (2H)** each. This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, overlapping multiplet patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H, in the downfield region (typically δ > 7.0 ppm).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** that integrates to 3H, with a characteristic chemical shift of ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Characteristic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is diagnostic for an **aldehyde** (-CHO), which contradicts the ketone (-COCH₃) structure we deduced. Furthermore, the splitting pattern for the side chain is chemically impossible; the adjacent -CH₂- and -CHO protons would split each other (into a doublet and triplet), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, with the correct integration and a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) perfectly matches the 7 protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure of the compound from the information given in the question. The reasoning for this is consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** The most common and stable chemical group with this composition (-C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Its formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there must be a total of 7 hydrogen atoms in the structure (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) to be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* positions. The data presented in the options allows us to determine the correct isomer without ambiguity.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** A key analytical step is to recognize characteristic patterns. The NMR data in option C, `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, shows two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This simple `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern is the unmistakable, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm value), each integrating to **2H**, due to the two distinct, symmetrical sets of protons on the ring splitting each other.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Characteristic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, which contradicts the ketone structure we deduced. Furthermore, the splitting pattern shown for the side chain (two singlets) is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde; adjacent protons must split each other.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a **perfect match** for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration is 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H, which perfectly matches the 7 protons in our C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all provided candidate answers is sound, unanimously identifying the molecule as *para*-haloacetophenone.

Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound.\n\nA) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\nB) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\nC) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\nD) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the provided candidate agents and highlighting key points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nThis first step is foundational, and all provided answers reach the same correct conclusion through this logical process.\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" identifying the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring has 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy reveals an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nAssembling these clues:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The most stable and common chemical structure fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone** with the general structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This molecule has 7 total protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group), which must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce the Isomer**\n\nThe arrangement of the substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is crucial. The data presented in the options provides a major clue to solve this.\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** A key pattern visible in the correct option's aromatic region is two signals, both of which are **doublets (d)** that integrate to **two protons (2H)** each. This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry in this isomer results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into two clean doublets, simplifying the spectrum significantly.\n*   **Predicting the Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The signals will be downfield (high ppm value, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the 2.1-2.6 ppm range.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm. We will now systematically evaluate the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match. It shows the two doublets (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) for a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3 (3H, s)` signal for the acetyl methyl group. The total proton count (2+2+3 = 7H) is correct for the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the spectrum is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde structure; the adjacent aldehyde proton and methylene protons would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (> 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Deduction:** The foundational step is to correctly combine all pieces of information (carbon count, functional groups, core structure) to arrive at the correct molecular class (haloacetophenone).\n2.  **Using Answer Options to Infer Isomerism:** A key analytical skill is using the simplicity of the NMR options (specifically, the clean two-doublet pattern) to infer the correct isomer (*para*) without having to predict the complex spectra for the *ortho* and *meta* alternatives.\n3.  **Cross-Validating Functional Groups:** It is essential to check for consistency. The presence of a peak at ~9.9 ppm (Option C) is a clear contradiction to the acetyl group (-COCH₃) deduced from the problem's clues.\n4.  **Confirming Internal Consistency:** A spectrum must not only match the proposed structure but also be chemically plausible on its own. Option C fails this test because its side-chain splitting pattern violates basic coupling rules.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** A final check on the total proton count (integration) ensures that the spectrum matches the molecular formula. The sum of protons in option B (2+2+3) is 7, matching the C₈H₇XO structure perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the consensus chemical reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying it rigorously to the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information provided in the question to determine the identity of the unknown compound. This reasoning is consistent and correct across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached. A key detail is that this ring will have 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Putting these clues together:**\n1.  One substituent is a halogen (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br). This group contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  **Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of the Second Substituent.** The most common and chemically stable group with the composition C₂H₃O and containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns presented in the options to determine the specific isomer without ambiguity.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** The NMR data in option B, `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, shows a highly characteristic pattern of two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This simple and symmetrical pattern is a textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Other isomers (*ortho* or *meta*) would produce more complex, multi-peak splitting patterns.\n\nWith the structure confidently identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the -CH₃ group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Option against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Recognizing Aromatic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2+2+3=7H) correctly matches the 7 protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region, and the other integrations are incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 5: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** This spectrum can be rejected on two grounds. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is diagnostic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even for the corresponding aldehyde structure, the splitting pattern shown is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, not the two singlets shown.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidates and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound. This analysis is unanimously agreed upon by all the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached. A key implication is that there are 4 hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring itself.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nAssembling these facts leads to one logical conclusion for the substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, and it has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomerism**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer choices to determine the specific arrangement.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** Option D shows a highly symmetrical and characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, each integrating to **two protons (2H)** (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`). This simple pattern is a textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into clean doublets. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, less-symmetrical splitting patterns.\n\nWith the structure confidently identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm), each integrating to **2H**.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option from the original prompt against our prediction of two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, which contradicts the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the splitting pattern for the side chain (two singlets) is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum completely lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the candidate answers to ensure a robust conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound.\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" An aromatic ring (benzene) has 6 carbons, which leaves 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nCombining these clues allows us to deduce the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most stable and common chemical group with this composition (-C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that will be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n*   **Inferring Isomerism:** The spectral data in option (A) shows a highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two clean doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** With the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm), each integrating to **2H**. This is due to the two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring splitting each other.\n    2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, with a typical chemical shift around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match. It shows the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, all at characteristic chemical shifts. The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is correct.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone functional group we deduced. This option also describes a chemically flawed spectrum (the side-chain protons would split each other, not appear as two singlets).\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one in the aromatic region.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** All information (carbon count, ring type, functional groups) must be logically combined to determine the correct molecular class (haloacetophenone) and formula (C₈H₇XO).\n2.  **Using Spectral Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** A simple, symmetric splitting pattern in the aromatic region, such as `(2H, d), (2H, d)`, is a powerful clue that points directly to a para-substituted ring, bypassing the need to consider more complex isomers.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** It is vital to know characteristic chemical shift regions. A peak at ~9.9 ppm is a strong indicator of an aldehyde, while a peak at ~2.3 ppm is very common for an acetyl methyl group. Peaks from ~6.5-8.5 ppm belong to aromatic protons.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A candidate spectrum should be chemically plausible. A spectrum showing adjacent protons that don't split each other (as in the side chain of option C) violates basic coupling rules and can be dismissed.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular structure. In this case, the total must be 7H.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information from the question to identify the compound.\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic (benzene) ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** Spectroscopy confirms an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen atom, -X, is attached to the ring) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This contributes **0 carbons**.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining **2 carbons** and the **carbonyl group**. The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, meaning there are a total of 7 protons to account for in the ¹H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. The spectral data in the options provides a strong clue to the correct arrangement.\n*   **Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum:** A key pattern visible in the options is a set of two distinct signals in the aromatic region (downfield), both of which are **doublets (d)** that each integrate to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm), each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group's methyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. Their signal will be a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the aliphatic region, typically around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option provided in the question based on our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3` singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integrations (2+2+3=7H) are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one in the correct region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum is flawed for two reasons. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would have to split each other's signals, but they are incorrectly shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path to the answer is to first deduce the molecular structure (para-haloacetophenone) by systematically combining all clues from the question (carbon count, ring type, functional groups).\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The `two 2H doublets` pattern in the aromatic region is a critical shortcut that points directly to a para-substituted ring, simplifying the problem significantly.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The singlet around ~2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while the peak at ~9.9 ppm in option D is a clear indicator of a different functional group (aldehyde) and allows for its immediate rejection.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A correct answer must be chemically plausible in all respects. Option D fails this test because it shows protons on adjacent carbons that are not split, violating fundamental NMR coupling rules.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H) must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular formula (C₈H₇XO), providing a final confirmation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate agents and highlighting key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the clues from the question to identify the chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups. This means there must be 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.** We can logically determine the two substituents by combining these clues:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**. The most stable and common chemical group that fits this -C₂H₃O description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.** The spectral data in Option A shows a highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the specific isomer.\n\nWith the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield, > 7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One signal, which is a **singlet (s)** because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting. It will integrate to **3H** and have a characteristic chemical shift around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic). We will now rigorously check all four options.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It contains the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and total integration (2+2+3=7H) are all correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Verifying Aromatic Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Contradictory Functional Groups and Flawed Splitting.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other (into a triplet and a doublet), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 5: Recognizing Required Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum is missing any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this compound.\n\n**Final Decision**\nThe systematic analysis of the problem overwhelmingly supports the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The ¹H NMR data provided in option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in every aspect: chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus chemical reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting key points for a robust conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nThe first step is to use all the clues in the problem description to determine the exact chemical structure of the compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself provides 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy reveals two key functional groups: an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen atom, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, such as Cl, Br). This substituent contributes **0 carbons**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbons** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  The most common and stable chemical group with the formula -C₂H₃O is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer Isomerism**\n\nNext, we must predict what the spectrum should look like. The substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is critical, and the answer choices provide a definitive clue.\n\n*   **Inferring the Isomer from Spectral Patterns:** A highly characteristic pattern appears in the correct answer: two signals in the aromatic region that are both **doublets (d)** and each integrate to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**, in the downfield region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl methyl group (-CH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Their signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**, with a characteristic chemical shift around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now systematically compare our prediction—`two 2H doublets (aromatic) + one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`—against the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring, the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, and all signals are in the expected chemical shift regions. The total integration (2+2+3 = 7H) is correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm) and thus cannot represent the described molecule.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is diagnostic for an aldehyde, not the ketone functional group we deduced. Furthermore, the signal for the aliphatic group (-CH₂-) should be adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO) in the corresponding isomer, meaning they would split each other, not appear as two separate singlets. This makes the spectrum chemically impossible.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path to the answer is to first combine all clues (carbon count, ring type, functional groups) to deduce the molecular structure of *para*-haloacetophenone before analyzing the spectra.\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a powerful clue that immediately identifies the highly symmetrical *para* isomer, simplifying the problem and eliminating the need to predict the more complex spectra of *ortho* or *meta* isomers.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The signal at ~2.3 ppm is characteristic of a methyl ketone (-COCH₃), while the signal at ~9.9 ppm (in option D) is a clear red flag for a different functional group (an aldehyde).\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A correct spectrum must be chemically sound. Option D can be dismissed not only for having the wrong functional group but also because its splitting pattern (two singlets for an adjacent -CH₂-CHO group) violates the fundamental rules of proton coupling.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** Always perform a final check by summing the integration values. For option A, the sum is 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H, which perfectly matches the number of protons in the deduced C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning and identifying key points for an accurate conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the compound from the information provided.\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" indicating a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄XY).\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" and a \"carbonyl group (C=O).\"\n\n**Assembling the structure based on these clues:**\n1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  The most common and stable chemical group with the formula -C₂H₃O and containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer\n\nThe substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. A critical step is using the provided answer choices to determine the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Using Spectral Patterns to Infer Isomerism.** The spectral data in option A shows a highly symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This clean `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern is a classic, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The molecule's high degree of symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into simple doublets.\n\nWith the compound identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can confidently predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ > 7.0 ppm), with each signal integrating to **2H**.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** This signal will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, as there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting. Its characteristic chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It has two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and a 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, all within the expected chemical shift regions.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Verifying Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** This option is wrong for two reasons. First, the signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even for the corresponding aldehyde, the splitting pattern is chemically impossible. The adjacent -CH₂- and -CHO protons would split each other, but they are shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe logical analysis of the provided information leads unequivocally to the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The ¹H NMR data presented in option A is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure. All candidate agents followed this step correctly.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic ring (benzene) itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.** This information allows for a logical deduction of the two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. The patterns in the answer options allow us to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.**\nThe splitting pattern `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` appears in the provided options. This pattern of **two clean doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Ortho and meta isomers would produce more complex, less symmetrical splitting patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this structure in mind, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic). We will now evaluate the options from the specific question provided.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Diagnostic Chemical Shifts.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone functional group we deduced. This option describes a different molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n**Final Decision Synthesis**\nThe candidate answers show a unanimous agreement on the chemical reasoning: the compound is para-haloacetophenone, and its spectrum should consist of two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet in the appropriate regions. The inconsistency in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicates that the options were randomized in the versions of the question they reviewed. Applying the consensus reasoning to the specific question provided here leads to a single, unambiguous answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting the crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound. The reasoning for this step is universally agreed upon by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" A benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of the Structure.** We can combine these facts logically:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this C₂H₃O composition is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that will be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.** The splitting pattern in option (D) shows two distinct signals in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, multi-peak splitting patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this structure in mind, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`), and the integrations are inconsistent with our structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Diagnostic Chemical Shifts.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. **Careful Point 4: Checking for Chemical Inconsistency.** Even for the corresponding aldehyde, the spectrum is flawed. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 5: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidates and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information from the question to deduce the compound's structure.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" indicating a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄XY). A di-substituted ring will have 4 hydrogens directly attached to it.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself provides 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nCombining these clues allows for a logical deduction of the structure:\n1.  One substituent is a halogen (-X). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n3.  The most stable and common chemical group with the composition -C₂H₃O is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there are 7 total hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be in an *ortho*-, *meta*-, or *para*- arrangement. The patterns in the answer choices provide a definitive clue to identify the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** Option A presents a highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, and each integrating to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons that split each other into clean doublets, unlike the more complex patterns expected from *ortho* or *meta* isomers.\n\nWith the compound identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two doublets in the downfield region (high ppm value), each integrating to 2H.\n*   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets` in the aromatic region plus `one 3H singlet` in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match. It contains two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6 ppm`) for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring, and a singlet (`2.3 ppm`) for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All shifts, integrations (2+2+3=7H), and splitting patterns are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically δ > 6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum describes a different functional group (the peak at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an aldehyde) and is internally inconsistent, as the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other, not appear as two singlets.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider for Solving**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path is to systematically combine all clues (carbon count, functional groups, ring type) to build the molecular structure of haloacetophenone before interpreting the NMR data.\n2.  **Using the Answers to Inform the Question:** The simple splitting patterns presented in the options are a powerful clue. Recognizing the \"two 2H doublets\" pattern as the signature of a *para* isomer is the key insight that unlocks the problem without needing to consider more complex isomers.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** It is crucial to know characteristic chemical shift ranges. A peak near 2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while a peak near 10 ppm is a definitive marker for an aldehyde, allowing for quick elimination of incorrect options.\n4.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** A quick sum of the integration values (the `xH` numbers) should always match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular formula (C₈H₇XO has 7 protons). Only option A has a valid pattern that integrates to 7H.\n5.  **Checking for Chemical Consistency:** Even if an option seems plausible, check that the splitting patterns obey chemical rules (like the n+1 rule). Option D fails this test because adjacent protons shown as singlets violate coupling rules, making it a classic \"distractor\" answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on a synthesis of the candidate agents' reasoning and a careful evaluation of the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound. This process was performed correctly and unanimously by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" A benzene ring accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.**\nBy combining these facts, we can logically determine the two substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns presented in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.**\nThe splitting pattern shown in option (B), `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, less symmetrical splitting patterns. This strong clue allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this specific structure identified, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` and `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Inconsistent Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is diagnostic for an **aldehyde** proton, not the ketone functional group we deduced. Furthermore, this spectrum is internally inconsistent, as the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons of the corresponding isomer would split each other, not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Recognizing the Required Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information provided in the question to determine the identity of the compound. This is the foundational step and all candidate answers performed it correctly.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates the presence of a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (meaning a halogen atom is attached directly to the ring).\n\nPutting these clues together:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl or -Br). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**. The simplest and most stable chemical structure fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there are a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce the Isomer\n\nNext, we must predict the spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is key, and the options themselves provide the most significant clue.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** A key analytical technique is to observe the splitting patterns offered in the answers. Option C shows a distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, both of which are **doublets (d)** that integrate to **two protons (2H)** each. This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, overlapping multiplet patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H, in the downfield region (typically δ > 7.0 ppm).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** that integrates to 3H, with a characteristic chemical shift of ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Characteristic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is diagnostic for an **aldehyde** (-CHO), which contradicts the ketone (-COCH₃) structure we deduced. Furthermore, the splitting pattern for the side chain is chemically impossible; the adjacent -CH₂- and -CHO protons would split each other (into a doublet and triplet), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, with the correct integration and a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) perfectly matches the 7 protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure of the compound from the information given in the question. The reasoning for this is consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** The most common and stable chemical group with this composition (-C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Its formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there must be a total of 7 hydrogen atoms in the structure (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) to be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* positions. The data presented in the options allows us to determine the correct isomer without ambiguity.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** A key analytical step is to recognize characteristic patterns. The NMR data in option C, `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, shows two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This simple `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern is the unmistakable, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm value), each integrating to **2H**, due to the two distinct, symmetrical sets of protons on the ring splitting each other.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Characteristic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, which contradicts the ketone structure we deduced. Furthermore, the splitting pattern shown for the side chain (two singlets) is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde; adjacent protons must split each other.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a **perfect match** for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration is 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H, which perfectly matches the 7 protons in our C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all provided candidate answers is sound, unanimously identifying the molecule as *para*-haloacetophenone. A direct analysis of the options presented in the question shows that only option C provides the correct ¹H NMR data for this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton count, and splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate answers and applying it methodically to the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure from the clues provided in the question.\n*   **Core Structure & Carbon Count**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" containing \"8 carbon atoms in total\".

One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.

A critical piece of information to determine the correct isomer is found within the answer choices themselves.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** Option (D) presents a very clear and symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This specific `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into clean doublets. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns.\n\nWith the structure confidently identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets in the downfield region (typically 7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2H.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One singlet integrating to 3H.
