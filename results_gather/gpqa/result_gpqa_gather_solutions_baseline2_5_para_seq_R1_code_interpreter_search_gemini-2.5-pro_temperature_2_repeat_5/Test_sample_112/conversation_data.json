The first is the O-H stretch, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding, and the second is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule contains an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Interpretation**: The data provides direct confirmation for the FTIR analysis.\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is explicit proof of hydrogens attached directly to a C=C double bond, confirming the molecule is an **alkene**.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Interpretation**: The mass spectrum provides powerful, independent confirmation.\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic and highly diagnostic fragment. It corresponds precisely to the mass of the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Calculation: 12 (C) + 2 * 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu). This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Formula Options**: The combined data from all three techniques leads to a definitive conclusion: the molecule is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two non-negotiable requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n\n    *   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count**. A carboxylic acid (-COOH) must contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU is the sum of pi bonds and rings. The evidence shows one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. Therefore, the total DoU must be **2**.\n\n    Now, we evaluate the provided options against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The options provided are:\n    A) C6H12O2\n    B) C6H12O\n    C) C6H10O2\n    D) C6H10O\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate options **B) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O**, as they contain only one oxygen atom.\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 2 (DoU = 2) on the remaining options:**\n        *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 is a perfect match. It accounts for both the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n*   **Confluence of Evidence:** The strongest conclusions in spectral analysis come when multiple, independent techniques point to the same functional groups. Here, the carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR and Mass Spec, and the alkene is confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **Key Spectral Features:** The **broadness** of the ~3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is crucial for distinguishing a carboxylic acid from an alcohol. The **m/z=45** fragment is a powerful, classic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as a Quantitative Check:** The DoU calculation is the definitive final step. It is a strict mathematical requirement that must be met, and it successfully differentiates between the final two candidates.\n*   **Consensus in Chemical Reasoning:** All candidate answers, despite their different final letter choices, arrived at the same correct chemical formula: **C6H10O2**. The variation in their final answer letters was due to the options being listed in a different order for each agent, a clerical issue, not a scientific one.\n\n**Final Conclusion**: The only molecular formula that satisfies all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. Based on the list of options provided in the question, this formula corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a synthesis of the reasoning from the provided candidate answers, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The combination of a **very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by hydrogen bonding), a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch), and a **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** (C=C alkene stretch) is definitive evidence for an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. The \"very broad\" nature of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak is a key identifier for the O-H of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The mention of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens on a C=C double bond, directly corroborating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a classic, highly diagnostic peak for a **carboxylic acid**, corresponding to the mass of the **[COOH]⁺ fragment** (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu).\n\n2.  **Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula:**\n    The evidence from all three techniques converges on the conclusion that the unknown is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Atom Count):** A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. Therefore, the correct formula must have the form C₆Hₓ**O₂**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule contains one C=O double bond (1 DoU) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements:**\n    The four choices given in the question are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H12O, C) C6H10O2, and D) C6H10O.\n    *   **Apply Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We first filter out any formulas that do not contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates B) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n    *   **Apply Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** We now distinguish between the remaining formulas, A) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2, using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. We are looking for a DoU of 2.\n        *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid and implies the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. The DoU of 2 correctly accounts for both one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The only chemical formula that is consistent with all the experimental data is **C6H10O2**. Based on the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option C.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Converging Evidence:** The strongest conclusions in spectral analysis come when multiple techniques independently support the same finding. Here, the carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR and Mass Spec, while the alkene is confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n*   **FTIR Nuance:** The description of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak as \"very broad\" is a critical detail. It is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid due to strong hydrogen bonding, which distinguishes it from the typically less broad peak of an alcohol or the sharp peaks of C-H stretches.\n*   **Diagnostic Fragments:** The m/z = 45 fragment in mass spectrometry is a powerful, classic piece of confirmatory evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group that should not be overlooked.\n*   **Systematic Filtering:** The most robust and efficient way to solve the problem is to first apply the simple, non-negotiable filter (atom count: must have O₂) and then use the quantitative calculation (Degree of Unsaturation) to decide between the remaining candidates.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping:** A final point of care is to map the scientifically determined correct formula (C6H10O2) back to the specific lettered option from the original question's list, which in this case is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning presented by the candidate agents, the correct answer can be determined through the following steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (indicating an O-H stretch significantly broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (indicating a C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion*: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides explicit, direct confirmation of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group, as vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu). This provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Evaluate Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   The combined evidence from all three techniques leads to the unequivocal conclusion that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   This conclusion sets two non-negotiable requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n        1.  **Oxygen Count:** The formula must contain a carboxylic acid group, which means it must have exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n        2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The compound must contain two double bonds: one C=O and one C=C. Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **DoU must be 2**.\n    *   Now, we evaluate the provided options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n        *   A) **C6H10O2**: Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **This perfectly matches both requirements.**\n        *   B) **C6H12O2**: Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect as it only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated carbon chain, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n        *   C) **C6H10O**: Has only 1 oxygen. Fails the oxygen count requirement.\n        *   D) **C6H12O**: Has only 1 oxygen. Fails the oxygen count requirement.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Evidence Combination:** The solution does not rely on a single piece of data. The high confidence comes from the convergence of evidence: the carboxylic acid is confirmed by both FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spec (m/z=45 fragment), while the alkene is confirmed by both FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n*   **Significance of Peak Characteristics:** The description of the peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ as \"very broad\" is crucial. This is the key detail that distinguishes the O-H of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid from the O-H of an alcohol or the sharp C-H stretch of an alkyne.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is the decisive quantitative tool. After filtering by atom count (requiring O₂), the DoU calculation is the definitive step that mathematically proves C6H10O2 is the only possible answer and that C6H12O2 is incorrect. The DoU must account for *all* identified sources of unsaturation (C=O and C=C).\n*   **Answer Mapping:** The chemical reasoning across all provided candidate answers was unanimously correct in identifying C6H10O2 as the formula. The only discrepancies were in the final letter chosen, which resulted from inconsistencies in how the options were listed. It is critical to map the correct chemical formula back to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided data and a synthesis of the reasoning from the candidate agents.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Interpretation**:\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is a definitive spectroscopic signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The first peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the second is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   An additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule contains an **alkene** functional group and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Interpretation**:\n    *   The explicit observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** directly confirms the presence of the C=C double bond (alkene), as vinyl hydrogens are those attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Interpretation**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is highly diagnostic. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation fragment, [COOH]⁺**. This is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids and provides powerful, independent confirmation of the functional group. (Calculation: 12 (C) + 2 × 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu).\n\n4.  **Synthesizing Evidence and Establishing Formula Requirements**:\n    The combined data from all three techniques leads to an unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** Since the molecule is a carboxylic acid, its formula **must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂) **.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The compound has one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**:\n    We now test the provided options against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **C6H12O**: Fails Requirement 1 (only one oxygen).\n    *   **C6H10O**: Fails Requirement 1 (only one oxygen).\n    *   **C6H12O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). However, its DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**. This fails Requirement 2. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Its DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**. This perfectly matches Requirement 2, accounting for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Combined Evidence is Key**: The strength of the conclusion comes from the fact that different analytical techniques provide mutually reinforcing evidence. For example, the carboxylic acid is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by mass spectrometry, while the alkene is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by NMR.\n*   **The Importance of Peak Shape**: In FTIR, the \"very broad\" nature of the peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a critical detail that confidently distinguishes a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch from an alcohol's O-H stretch.\n*   **Using Diagnostic Fragments**: Recognizing classic mass spec fragments, like m/z = 45 for [COOH]⁺, is a powerful and efficient way to confirm a functional group.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as a Decisive Tool**: The DoU is a quantitative check that is crucial for distinguishing between formulas that otherwise seem plausible (like C6H12O2 and C6H10O2). The DoU must account for *all* sources of unsaturation (pi bonds and rings) identified in the spectra.\n*   **Systematic Elimination**: The most logical approach is to first eliminate options based on simple, non-negotiable facts (like the number of oxygen atoms) before performing calculations like the DoU on the remaining possibilities.\n*   **Avoiding Clerical Errors**: All candidate answers correctly identified the chemical formula as C6H10O2 through their reasoning. The discrepancies in their final letter choice highlight the importance of carefully mapping the scientifically correct answer back to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n**Final Conclusion**:\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. Based on the list of options provided with the question (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2), this corresponds to the second formula in that list. Given the labeling in the prompt (`A) C6H12O2`, `B) C6H10O2`, ...), the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the candidate answers and adding key points of emphasis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the unambiguous signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broadness is a key identifier, caused by strong hydrogen bonding between the O-H groups of the acid molecules. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the characteristic C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   The explicit mention of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides direct confirmation of the alkene (C=C) functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**. (Mass calculation: 12 (for Carbon) + 2 * 16 (for Oxygen) + 1 (for Hydrogen) = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Requirements for the Formula:**\n    The combined data from all three techniques leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion creates two strict requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Atom Count):** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a subscript of O₂.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The unknown has one pi bond in the C=O group of the acid and one pi bond in the C=C group of the alkene. Thus, the correct formula must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We can now systematically test the given formula options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **C6H12O** and **C6H10O**: Fail Requirement 1. They both contain only one oxygen atom and therefore cannot be carboxylic acids.\n    *   **C6H12O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Let's test Requirement 2. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Let's test Requirement 2. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU is a perfect match, accounting for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Evidence Combination:** The strength of the analysis comes from combining the consistent story told by three different spectroscopic techniques. Each piece of evidence confirms the others, leading to a high-confidence conclusion.\n*   **Key Spectroscopic Signatures:** The *broadness* of the ~3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is crucial to identifying a carboxylic acid over an alcohol. The m/z=45 fragment is a classic and powerful confirmation of the -COOH group.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This is a critical quantitative tool for checking the validity of a proposed formula against the known functional groups. The DoU calculation must account for *all* sources of unsaturation (all pi bonds and rings) identified in the spectra.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** The most efficient method for solving is to first eliminate options based on the simplest requirement (the count of oxygen atoms), and then apply the more complex DoU calculation to the remaining candidates.\n*   **Candidate Answer Consensus:** The scientific reasoning across all 15 provided candidate answers is unanimously correct. They all independently perform the correct chemical analysis and arrive at the formula **C6H10O2**. The discrepancies in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, D) are due to inconsistent formatting of the option lists in their individual analyses, not errors in chemical logic.\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the provided option list, this is choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a systematic review of the provided candidate answers and the original problem data, here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis and a list of careful points to arrive at the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    There is a unanimous and correct consensus on interpreting the FTIR data. The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is also an alkene. Therefore, the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    All agents correctly note that the observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group, as these are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This serves as powerful, independent evidence that corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic and classic piece of evidence. All agents correctly identify that this mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Requirements for the Formula:**\n    The combined, mutually reinforcing evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict, non-negotiable requirements on the molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** It must contain a carboxylic acid group, which means the formula must have exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one pi bond in the C=O group and one pi bond in the C=C group. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation must be 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We must test the four options provided in the original question against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The options given are: A) C6H10O2, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H12O, and D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate options **C) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O** because they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 2 (DoU = 2) for the remaining options:**\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n        *   For **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement, accounting for both the C=O bond of the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This is the correct formula.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Evidence:** The high degree of confidence in the conclusion comes from multiple techniques confirming the same structural features. The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and confirmed by Mass Spec; the alkene is identified by FTIR and confirmed by ¹H NMR.\n*   **Recognizing Key Spectroscopic Signatures:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the specific details of the data, such as the *broadness* of the FTIR O-H peak (which points to a carboxylic acid over an alcohol) and the diagnostic power of the m/z=45 mass fragment.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as a Decisive Tool:** The DoU calculation is the key quantitative step that definitively differentiates between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms. It is not just an estimate; it must be an exact match for the number of pi bonds and rings identified in the spectra.\n*   **Systematic Process of Elimination:** The most efficient and reliable path to the answer is to first filter the options by simple, non-negotiable criteria (like atom counts) before performing more complex calculations (like DoU) on the remaining plausible candidates.\n*   **Consensus and Final Mapping:** The scientific reasoning across all 15 candidate answers was unanimously correct in identifying the chemical formula as **C6H10O2**. The discrepancies in the final letter choices were merely a result of being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The critical final step is to map the scientifically-derived formula (C6H10O2) to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all pieces of experimental data is C6H10O2. In the provided question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the provided spectroscopic data and a synthesis of the candidate agents' reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by intermolecular hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (the C=O carbonyl stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule contains an alkene functional group and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is explicit and unambiguous proof of the alkene (C=C) functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. This observation directly corroborates the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic and highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This provides powerful, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Formula Requirements:**\n    The combined data from all three techniques points to a single, high-confidence conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two non-negotiable requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a subscript of O₂.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The unknown has one pi bond in the C=O group and one pi bond in the C=C group. Thus, the correct formula must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We will now test the given options from the question against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C6H12O2\n    *   B) C6H10O\n    *   C) C6H12O\n    *   D) C6H10O2\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n        *   Eliminate B) C6H10O and C) C6H12O.\n        *   We are left with A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation = 2):**\n        *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. A DoU of 2 correctly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Evidence:** The high confidence in the final answer comes from the fact that all three spectroscopic techniques provide mutually reinforcing evidence. For example, the FTIR suggests a carboxylic acid, and the MS fragment at m/z=45 confirms it.\n*   **Key Spectroscopic Details:** The \"very broad\" nature of the 3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is a critical detail that specifically points to a carboxylic acid O-H, distinguishing it from a typically less broad alcohol O-H.\n*   **The Power of a Diagnostic Fragment:** The m/z=45 fragment is a classic signature in mass spectrometry that is highly specific to the presence of a carboxylic acid, serving as powerful confirmatory evidence.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as a Quantitative Check:** After identifying the functional groups, the DoU calculation is the key quantitative step that acts as a definitive check on the formula. The DoU must account for *all* sources of unsaturation identified in the spectra.\n*   **Avoiding Clerical Errors:** The candidate answers were unanimous in their scientific reasoning but varied in their final letter choice. This highlights the importance of the final step: accurately mapping the chemically correct formula (**C6H10O2**) to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the spectral evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the options provided, this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a synthesis of the correct chemical reasoning present in all the candidate answers, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Interpretation of FTIR Spectrum**:\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is the unambiguous signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   An additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule contains an alkene functional group and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of ¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides direct, explicit proof of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group. This corroborates the conclusion drawn from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Interpretation of Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. This mass corresponds precisely to the mass of the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu).\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Options**:\n    The combined data from all three techniques points to a single, high-confidence conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion creates two non-negotiable requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid must contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) reflects the sum of all pi bonds and rings. The compound has one C=O bond and one C=C bond. Therefore, its total **DoU must be 2**.\n\n    We now evaluate the given options from the question against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O**: Incorrect. Fails Requirement 1 as it has only one oxygen.\n    *   **B) C6H12O**: Incorrect. Fails Requirement 1 as it has only one oxygen.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Let's check the DoU: `DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1`. This fails Requirement 2. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated carbon chain, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Let's check the DoU: `DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2`. This **perfectly matches** Requirement 2, accounting for both the C=O and the C=C double bonds.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Consistency of Evidence**: The strongest conclusions in spectral analysis arise when multiple independent techniques point to the same structural features. Here, the carboxylic acid is confirmed by both FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is confirmed by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n*   **Key Spectral Signatures**: Recognizing classic signatures is crucial. The *broadness* of the ~3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is what distinguishes a carboxylic acid's O-H from an alcohol's. The m/z=45 fragment is a textbook indicator for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is Decisive**: After initial filtering by atom count, the DoU calculation is the key quantitative tool that definitively proves C6H10O2 is the only possible answer and C6H12O2 is not.\n*   **Systematic Elimination**: The most reliable approach is to apply the simplest, most definitive rules first. Eliminating options based on the required oxygen count is faster and less prone to error than calculating the DoU for every option at the start.\n*   **Analyzing Candidate Answer Discrepancies**: The chemical reasoning across all 15 candidate answers was unanimously correct in identifying C6H10O2 as the formula. The wide variation in the final letter chosen (A, B, C, or D) stems from inconsistent option lists in their prompts, which is a clerical error, not a scientific one. The final answer must be based on mapping the correct formula to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2. In the given question, this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided data and candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:** All candidate agents correctly and unanimously interpreted the data to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹** (indicating an O-H stretch significantly broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (indicating a C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is also an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The explicit mention of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides unambiguous, direct proof of a C=C double bond, as these are protons attached directly to the double-bonded carbons. This confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (atomic mass calculation: 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This strongly corroborates the FTIR interpretation.\n\n2.  **Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula:** Based on the conclusive identification of the functional groups, the correct molecular formula must meet two strict criteria:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, it **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU indicates the sum of pi bonds and rings. The compound contains one pi bond in the C=O group and a second pi bond in the C=C group. Therefore, the total **DoU must be 2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:** We will now test the options provided in the question's prompt against these two requirements using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   The options are: A) C6H10O2, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H12O, D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 1:** We immediately eliminate formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n        *   Eliminate **C) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O**.\n        *   This leaves us with options A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 2:** We calculate the DoU for the remaining options, looking for a value of 2.\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated and contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. A DoU of 2 correctly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds identified in the spectra.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Confluence of Evidence:** The high degree of certainty in the answer comes from the fact that three independent analytical techniques all provide corroborating evidence for the same conclusion (an unsaturated carboxylic acid).\n*   **Interpreting Key Spectral Features:** Recognizing the specific meaning of features like the **\"very broad\"** shape of the 3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak and the diagnostic **m/z = 45** mass fragment is crucial for an accurate analysis.\n*   **Quantitative Check using DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation calculation is the decisive final step. It serves as a quantitative mathematical check that must be satisfied, allowing for a clear choice between the two formulas that contain two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Addressing Answer Inconsistency:** The scientific reasoning across all candidate answers was uniformly correct, with every agent correctly identifying C6H10O2 as the molecular formula. The discrepancies in their final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) arose from inconsistent option ordering in their individual prompts. The correct procedure is to perform the chemical analysis first and then map the correct formula to the specific option list provided in the main question.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.

The correct formula must therefore contain O₂.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU represents the sum of rings and pi bonds. The compound has one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. Therefore, the total DoU must be **2**.\n\n    We now test the provided options from the question against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The options are: A) C6H12O, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   First, we filter by the oxygen count, which must be two. This immediately eliminates options **A) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O**.\n    *   Next, we evaluate the remaining options by calculating their DoU. We need a DoU of 2.\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated carbon chain, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n        *   For **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. This DoU correctly accounts for both the C=O and the C=C double bonds identified in the spectra.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Combining Evidence:** The strength of the analysis comes from using all data in concert. The FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec data all converge to tell the same story, increasing the confidence in the final answer.\n*   **Recognizing Diagnostic Signatures:** The \"very broad\" peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ in FTIR and the m/z = 45 fragment in Mass Spec are classic, high-value signatures for a carboxylic acid. Recognizing these speeds up the analysis and increases accuracy.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** A logical process of first eliminating options based on simple atom counts (O₂) and then applying a more complex calculation (DoU) to the remaining candidates is the most efficient and robust method.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This is the key quantitative tool that provides the decisive piece of evidence needed to distinguish between the final two plausible formulas. The DoU must account for *all* sources of unsaturation indicated by the data.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The scientific reasoning across all candidate answers was uniformly correct in identifying **C6H10O2** as the formula. Discrepancies in the final letter choices highlight the importance of the final step: accurately mapping the scientifically-derived formula to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n**Final Decision**:\nThe only molecular formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the option list in the question, this corresponds to **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the candidate answers and evaluating the evidence provided.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   An additional **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which indicates the molecule is an alkene and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is an explicit and unambiguous confirmation of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This finding directly corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic and highly diagnostic piece of evidence in mass spectrometry. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**. (Mass calculation: C(12) + O(16) + O(16) + H(1) = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Formula Requirements:**\n    The combined, mutually reinforcing evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have two oxygens (O₂).\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The unknown has one pi bond in the C=O group of the acid and a second pi bond in the C=C group of the alkene. Thus, the correct formula must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We will now test the given options against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   The provided options are: A) C6H12O, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H10O2, and D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate formulas with only one oxygen.\n        *   Eliminate A) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n        *   This leaves us with B) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2.\n\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** We now check the DoU for the remaining options, seeking a value of 2.\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. A DoU of 2 correctly accounts for both the C=O and the C=C double bonds required by the spectra.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Evidence:** The key to solving this problem is synthesizing information from all three techniques. No single piece of data is sufficient on its own. The power of the analysis comes from how well the different pieces of data corroborate each other.\n*   **Key Spectroscopic Signatures:** Recognizing classic spectral signatures is crucial. The broadness of the ~3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is a critical detail distinguishing a carboxylic acid O-H from an alcohol O-H. The m/z=45 fragment is a powerful and specific confirmation of the -COOH group.\n*   **Using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This is a critical quantitative tool that allows you to validate a proposed formula against the known functional groups. It is the decisive step that distinguishes between the final two candidates.\n*   **Systematic Process of Elimination:** The most efficient method for solving is to first eliminate options based on the simplest requirement (the count of oxygen atoms), and then apply the more complex DoU calculation to the remaining candidates.\n*   **Avoiding Clerical Errors:** The candidate answers showed correct chemical reasoning but differed in their final letter choice, indicating their option lists were inconsistent. It is crucial to perform the chemical analysis first and then carefully map the resulting correct formula (**C6H10O2**) back to the specific option list provided in the question prompt.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the analysis of the provided information and candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** together are a definitive spectroscopic signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of the C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond, which supports the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is highly diagnostic and strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group. This mass corresponds to the **carboxyl cation fragment, [COOH]⁺**. (Mass calculation: 12 (C) + 2 × 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Requirements:**\n    The combined data from all three techniques leads to an unequivocal conclusion about the compound's structure: it is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count.** Since the molecule is a carboxylic acid, its formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The compound has one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We will now test the provided options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *The provided options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O2, C) C6H10O, D) C6H12O.*\n    *   **Applying Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate options with only one oxygen.\n        *   Eliminate **C) C6H10O** and **D) C6H12O**.\n    *   **Applying Requirement 2 (DoU = 2) on the remaining options:**\n        *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU is a perfect match, accounting for both the C=O and the C=C bonds.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Confluence of Evidence:** The strongest conclusions in spectral analysis come from combining consistent evidence. The carboxylic acid is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by Mass Spec. The alkene is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by NMR.\n*   **Key Spectral Features:** Recognizing classic signatures is vital. The \"very broad\" 3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is key for identifying the carboxylic acid's O-H, and the m/z=45 fragment is a powerful, specific confirmation.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation is Decisive:** The DoU calculation is the crucial quantitative step that allows differentiation between plausible formulas that have the same types of atoms. It must account for *all* identified sources of unsaturation.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** The most efficient and reliable way to solve this is to first filter options based on simple, non-negotiable criteria (like atom counts) before performing calculations (like DoU).\n*   **Candidate Answer Analysis:** All provided candidate answers performed the chemical reasoning correctly and unanimously identified C6H10O2 as the correct formula.

It is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid due to strong hydrogen bonding, which distinguishes it from the typically less broad peak of an alcohol or the sharp peaks of C-H stretches.\n*   **Diagnostic Fragments:** The m/z = 45 fragment in mass spectrometry is a powerful, classic piece of confirmatory evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group that should not be overlooked.\n*   **Systematic Filtering:** The most robust and efficient way to solve the problem is to first apply the simple, non-negotiable filter (atom count: must have O₂) and then use the quantitative calculation (Degree of Unsaturation) to decide between the remaining candidates.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping:** A final point of care is to map the scientifically determined correct formula (C6H10O2) back to the specific lettered option from the original question's list, which in this case is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning presented by the candidate agents, the correct answer can be determined through the following steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (indicating an O-H stretch significantly broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (indicating a C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion*: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides explicit, direct confirmation of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group, as vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu). This provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Evaluate Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   The combined evidence from all three techniques leads to the unequivocal conclusion that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   This conclusion sets two non-negotiable requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n        1.  **Oxygen Count:** The formula must contain a carboxylic acid group, which means it must have exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n        2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The compound must contain two double bonds: one C=O and one C=C. Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **DoU must be 2**.\n    *   Now, we evaluate the provided options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n        *   A) **C6H10O2**: Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **This perfectly matches both requirements.**\n        *   B) **C6H12O2**: Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect as it only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated carbon chain, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n        *   C) **C6H10O**: Has only 1 oxygen. Fails the oxygen count requirement.\n        *   D) **C6H12O**: Has only 1 oxygen. Fails the oxygen count requirement.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Evidence Combination:** The solution does not rely on a single piece of data. The high confidence comes from the convergence of evidence: the carboxylic acid is confirmed by both FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spec (m/z=45 fragment), while the alkene is confirmed by both FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n*   **Significance of Peak Characteristics:** The description of the peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ as \"very broad\" is crucial. This is the key detail that distinguishes the O-H of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid from the O-H of an alcohol or the sharp C-H stretch of an alkyne.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is the decisive quantitative tool. After filtering by atom count (requiring O₂), the DoU calculation is the definitive step that mathematically proves C6H10O2 is the only possible answer and that C6H12O2 is incorrect. The DoU must account for *all* identified sources of unsaturation (C=O and C=C).\n*   **Answer Mapping:** The chemical reasoning across all provided candidate answers was unanimously correct in identifying C6H10O2 as the formula. The only discrepancies were in the final letter chosen, which resulted from inconsistencies in how the options were listed. It is critical to map the correct chemical formula back to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided data and a synthesis of the reasoning from the candidate agents.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Interpretation**:\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is a definitive spectroscopic signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The first peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the second is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   An additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule contains an **alkene** functional group and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Interpretation**:\n    *   The explicit observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** directly confirms the presence of the C=C double bond (alkene), as vinyl hydrogens are those attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Interpretation**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is highly diagnostic. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation fragment, [COOH]⁺**. This is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids and provides powerful, independent confirmation of the functional group. (Calculation: 12 (C) + 2 × 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu).\n\n4.  **Synthesizing Evidence and Establishing Formula Requirements**:\n    The combined data from all three techniques leads to an unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** Since the molecule is a carboxylic acid, its formula **must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂) **.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The compound has one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**:\n    We now test the provided options against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **C6H12O**: Fails Requirement 1 (only one oxygen).\n    *   **C6H10O**: Fails Requirement 1 (only one oxygen).\n    *   **C6H12O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). However, its DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**. This fails Requirement 2. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Its DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**. This perfectly matches Requirement 2, accounting for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Combined Evidence is Key**: The strength of the conclusion comes from the fact that different analytical techniques provide mutually reinforcing evidence. For example, the carboxylic acid is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by mass spectrometry, while the alkene is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by NMR.\n*   **The Importance of Peak Shape**: In FTIR, the \"very broad\" nature of the peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a critical detail that confidently distinguishes a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch from an alcohol's O-H stretch.\n*   **Using Diagnostic Fragments**: Recognizing classic mass spec fragments, like m/z = 45 for [COOH]⁺, is a powerful and efficient way to confirm a functional group.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as a Decisive Tool**: The DoU is a quantitative check that is crucial for distinguishing between formulas that otherwise seem plausible (like C6H12O2 and C6H10O2). The DoU must account for *all* sources of unsaturation (pi bonds and rings) identified in the spectra.\n*   **Systematic Elimination**: The most logical approach is to first eliminate options based on simple, non-negotiable facts (like the number of oxygen atoms) before performing calculations like the DoU on the remaining possibilities.\n*   **Avoiding Clerical Errors**: All candidate answers correctly identified the chemical formula as C6H10O2 through their reasoning. The discrepancies in their final letter choice highlight the importance of carefully mapping the scientifically correct answer back to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n**Final Conclusion**:\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. Based on the list of options provided with the question (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2), this corresponds to the second formula in that list. Given the labeling in the prompt (`A) C6H12O2`, `B) C6H10O2`, ...), the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the candidate answers and adding key points of emphasis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the unambiguous signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broadness is a key identifier, caused by strong hydrogen bonding between the O-H groups of the acid molecules. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the characteristic C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene and is therefore unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   The explicit mention of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides direct confirmation of the alkene (C=C) functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**. (Mass calculation: 12 (for Carbon) + 2 * 16 (for Oxygen) + 1 (for Hydrogen) = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Requirements for the Formula:**\n    The combined data from all three techniques leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion creates two strict requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Atom Count):** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a subscript of O₂.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The unknown has one pi bond in the C=O group of the acid and one pi bond in the C=C group of the alkene. Thus, the correct formula must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We can now systematically test the given formula options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **C6H12O** and **C6H10O**: Fail Requirement 1. They both contain only one oxygen atom and therefore cannot be carboxylic acids.\n    *   **C6H12O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Let's test Requirement 2. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: Passes Requirement 1 (two oxygens). Let's test Requirement 2. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU is a perfect match, accounting for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Evidence Combination:** The strength of the analysis comes from combining the consistent story told by three different spectroscopic techniques. Each piece of evidence confirms the others, leading to a high-confidence conclusion.\n*   **Key Spectroscopic Signatures:** The *broadness* of the ~3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is crucial to identifying a carboxylic acid over an alcohol. The m/z=45 fragment is a classic and powerful confirmation of the -COOH group.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This is a critical quantitative tool for checking the validity of a proposed formula against the known functional groups. The DoU calculation must account for *all* sources of unsaturation (all pi bonds and rings) identified in the spectra.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** The most efficient method for solving is to first eliminate options based on the simplest requirement (the count of oxygen atoms), and then apply the more complex DoU calculation to the remaining candidates.\n*   **Candidate Answer Consensus:** The scientific reasoning across all 15 provided candidate answers is unanimously correct. They all independently perform the correct chemical analysis and arrive at the formula **C6H10O2**. The discrepancies in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, D) are due to inconsistent formatting of the option lists in their individual analyses, not errors in chemical logic.\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the provided option list, this is choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a systematic review of the provided candidate answers and the original problem data, here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis and a list of careful points to arrive at the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    There is a unanimous and correct consensus on interpreting the FTIR data. The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is also an alkene. Therefore, the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    All agents correctly note that the observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group, as these are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond. This serves as powerful, independent evidence that corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic and classic piece of evidence. All agents correctly identify that this mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Establish Requirements for the Formula:**\n    The combined, mutually reinforcing evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict, non-negotiable requirements on the molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** It must contain a carboxylic acid group, which means the formula must have exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one pi bond in the C=O group and one pi bond in the C=C group. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation must be 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We must test the four options provided in the original question against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The options given are: A) C6H10O2, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H12O, and D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate options **C) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O** because they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 2 (DoU = 2) for the remaining options:**\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n        *   For **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement, accounting for both the C=O bond of the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This is the correct formula.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Evidence:** The high degree of confidence in the conclusion comes from multiple techniques confirming the same structural features. The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and confirmed by Mass Spec; the alkene is identified by FTIR and confirmed by ¹H NMR.\n*   **Recognizing Key Spectroscopic Signatures:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the specific details of the data, such as the *broadness* of the FTIR O-H peak (which points to a carboxylic acid over an alcohol) and the diagnostic power of the m/z=45 mass fragment.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as a Decisive Tool:** The DoU calculation is the key quantitative step that definitively differentiates between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms. It is not just an estimate; it must be an exact match for the number of pi bonds and rings identified in the spectra.\n*   **Systematic Process of Elimination:** The most efficient and reliable path to the answer is to first filter the options by simple, non-negotiable criteria (like atom counts) before performing more complex calculations (like DoU) on the remaining plausible candidates.\n*   **Consensus and Final Mapping:** The scientific reasoning across all 15 candidate answers was unanimously correct in identifying the chemical formula as **C6H10O2**. The discrepancies in the final letter choices were merely a result of being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The critical final step is to map the scientifically-derived formula (C6H10O2) to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all pieces of experimental data is C6H10O2.

The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is also an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The explicit mention of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides unambiguous, direct proof of a C=C double bond, as these are protons attached directly to the double-bonded carbons. This confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (atomic mass calculation: 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This strongly corroborates the FTIR interpretation.\n\n2.  **Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula:** Based on the conclusive identification of the functional groups, the correct molecular formula must meet two strict criteria:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, it **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU indicates the sum of pi bonds and rings. The compound contains one pi bond in the C=O group and a second pi bond in the C=C group. Therefore, the total **DoU must be 2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:** We will now test the options provided in the question's prompt against these two requirements using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   The options are: A) C6H10O2, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H12O, D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 1:** We immediately eliminate formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n        *   Eliminate **C) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O**.\n        *   This leaves us with options A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n\n    *   **Applying Requirement 2:** We calculate the DoU for the remaining options, looking for a value of 2.\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated and contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. A DoU of 2 correctly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds identified in the spectra.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Confluence of Evidence:** The high degree of certainty in the answer comes from the fact that three independent analytical techniques all provide corroborating evidence for the same conclusion (an unsaturated carboxylic acid).\n*   **Interpreting Key Spectral Features:** Recognizing the specific meaning of features like the **\"very broad\"** shape of the 3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak and the diagnostic **m/z = 45** mass fragment is crucial for an accurate analysis.\n*   **Quantitative Check using DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation calculation is the decisive final step. It serves as a quantitative mathematical check that must be satisfied, allowing for a clear choice between the two formulas that contain two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Addressing Answer Inconsistency:** The scientific reasoning across all candidate answers was uniformly correct, with every agent correctly identifying C6H10O2 as the molecular formula. The discrepancies in their final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) arose from inconsistent option ordering in their individual prompts. The correct procedure is to perform the chemical analysis first and then map the correct formula to the specific option list provided in the main question.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the option list provided in the question, this corresponds to option **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided information and a synthesis of the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate agents, the final answer is determined as follows.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (indicative of a hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (a C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The additional strong peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is also an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The explicit mention of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides unambiguous confirmation of the C=C double bond, as these are protons directly attached to the carbons of the alkene.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** The observation of a **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45), strongly confirming the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n2.  **Establish Requirements for the Chemical Formula:**\n    The combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a definitive conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two non-negotiable requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms, so the formula must have the form C₆Hₓ**O₂**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU is the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule contains one pi bond in the C=O group and one pi bond in the C=C group. Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We will now test the four provided options against these two requirements, using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **Options:** C6H10O2, C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H12O\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate the formulas with only one oxygen atom: C6H10O and C6H12O.\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 2 (DoU):** We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. We need a DoU of 2.\n        *   For **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a **perfect match**. A DoU of 2 correctly accounts for both the C=O and the C=C double bonds.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Confluence of Evidence:** The most robust conclusion comes from the fact that multiple, independent analytical techniques confirm the same structural features. The carboxylic acid is identified by both FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is identified by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n*   **Key Spectroscopic Signatures:** Recognizing classic patterns is crucial. The \"very broad\" nature of the 3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is a key differentiator for a carboxylic acid versus an alcohol. The m/z=45 fragment is a powerful, unambiguous confirmation of the -COOH group.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** The most efficient path to the solution is to first filter the options by simple, direct requirements (like atom count) before performing more complex calculations (like DoU).\n*   **The Degree of Unsaturation is Decisive:** The DoU calculation is the key mathematical step that distinguishes between the plausible final candidates (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2), providing a definitive answer.\n*   **Clerical Accuracy:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while their chemical reasoning was unanimously correct (identifying C6H10O2), they failed to map it consistently to the lettered choice. It is crucial to refer back to the specific option list provided in the question to select the final letter.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.

This directly corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Interpretation**:\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass precisely corresponds to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Calculation: 12 (C) + 2×16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This provides a third, independent line of evidence confirming the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing Evidence and Evaluating Formula Options**:\n    The combined data from all three techniques leads to a single, high-confidence conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** It must contain a carboxylic acid group, so the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** It contains two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C). Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** must be **2**.\n\n    We now evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **A) C6H10O2**:\n        *   Oxygen count: 2.

(Fails)\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Data Integration is Key**: The correct identification relies on the consistent story told by all three techniques (FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec). Each piece of evidence confirms and strengthens the others.\n*   **Recognizing Classic Signatures**: Identifying the broad O-H + C=O peak combination (carboxylic acid), vinyl hydrogens (alkene), and the m/z=45 fragment ([COOH]⁺) is essential for a quick and accurate analysis.\n*   **The Power of DoU**: The Degree of Unsaturation is a crucial quantitative tool.

The compound has one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We will now test the provided options against these two requirements using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *The provided options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O2, C) C6H10O, D) C6H12O.*\n    *   **Applying Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** We can immediately eliminate options with only one oxygen.\n        *   Eliminate **C) C6H10O** and **D) C6H12O**.\n    *   **Applying Requirement 2 (DoU = 2) on the remaining options:**\n        *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU is a perfect match, accounting for both the C=O and the C=C bonds.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Confluence of Evidence:** The strongest conclusions in spectral analysis come from combining consistent evidence. The carboxylic acid is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by Mass Spec. The alkene is indicated by FTIR and confirmed by NMR.\n*   **Key Spectral Features:** Recognizing classic signatures is vital. The \"very broad\" 3000 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak is key for identifying the carboxylic acid's O-H, and the m/z=45 fragment is a powerful, specific confirmation.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation is Decisive:** The DoU calculation is the crucial quantitative step that allows differentiation between plausible formulas that have the same types of atoms. It must account for *all* identified sources of unsaturation.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** The most efficient and reliable way to solve this is to first filter options based on simple, non-negotiable criteria (like atom counts) before performing calculations (like DoU).\n*   **Candidate Answer Analysis:** All provided candidate answers performed the chemical reasoning correctly and unanimously identified C6H10O2 as the correct formula. The disagreements on the final letter (A, B, C, or D) are due to them referencing different option lists and should be considered clerical errors. The scientific consensus is what matters.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. Based on the options provided in the original question, this corresponds to option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
