The candidate answers show a remarkable consensus in their chemical reasoning, even though their final letter choices differ, which strongly suggests they were presented with shuffled multiple-choice options. The core logic is sound and leads to an unambiguous product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis detailing the careful points required to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first rule provided is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's basic structure.\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis:** We must compare the steric environment of C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly states that a methyl group is attached to C1. This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is not mentioned as having a substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's connectivity.\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After an implicit workup step, the oxygen on C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   To name the resulting alcohol via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the primary functional group (-OH) is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To assign the lowest possible numbers (locants) to the substituents, the ring is numbered from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions **1, 2, 4, and 5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This allows us to eliminate options with an incorrect name. From the provided list:\n    *   A) `...2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   D) `...2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Determine the Final Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final step is to apply the second rule: **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. This will distinguish between options B and C.\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The starting material's name is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`, which tells us the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Resulting Configuration:** An inversion of the (S) configuration at the attacked center yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Mapping to Product Name:** As established in Careful Point 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes **C2** in the product's name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Final Selection**\n\nWe combine all the derived information to identify the full name of the product.\n*   **Base Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The key stereocenter at C2 must be (R). The other stereocenters are not involved in the reaction and their configurations are retained relative to the ring. The final name should be **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nNow, we match this correct product with the remaining options:\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This has the incorrect (2S) configuration, implying retention, which violates the given rules.\n*   C) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This has the correct base name and the correct (2R) configuration resulting from the required inversion of stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis organic chemistry problem requires a systematic application of two rules governing the ring-opening of an epoxide by a Gilman reagent. An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning, which will be followed here. The final answer is determined by applying this logic to the specific list of options in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first rule provided is that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis of hindrance:**\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached (as per the `1,3,4-trimethyl...` name), making it a sterically crowded, quaternary-like carbon center.\n    *   **C6** has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a significantly less hindered, tertiary-like carbon center.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the IUPAC name to identify the substituents on the epoxide ring. The methyl group on C1 is the key factor making it more hindered than C6.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Base Name (Connectivity)**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's fundamental structure and its IUPAC name.\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, this results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 and a newly added methyl group at C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexanol. The carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered **C1** (this corresponds to the original C1). The ring is numbered towards the adjacent, newly methylated carbon (the original C6) to give the lowest locants. This makes the original C6 the new **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Applying IUPAC nomenclature correctly is essential. An incorrect numbering, or assuming the wrong site of attack, would lead to an incorrect base name like `2,2,4,5-...`. The correct analysis shows the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name for the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options with a different carbon skeleton:\n    *   A) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect**\n    *   C) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect**\n    \nThe correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\nThe second rule states that an **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added.\n\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name specifies the configuration at C6 is **(S)** (`...6S...`).\n*   **Final Configuration:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter yields an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is critical to remember to perform the inversion (S → R) and correctly map the carbon from the reactant to the product. In the product's name, the original C6 becomes C2. Forgetting to invert (S → S) or misidentifying the product carbon would lead to the wrong stereoisomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its stereochemical name will contain `(2R)`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nCombining the conclusions from all three steps, the correct product must be:\n*   Named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Have an **(R) configuration at C2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Has an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, implying retention.\n*   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Has the correct base name and the required `(2R)` configuration from the inversion.\n\nThe systematic application of the provided rules unequivocally identifies (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol as the correct product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the chemical problem and the consistent reasoning presented in the candidate answers, the correct product can be determined through a step-by-step application of the given rules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, by a Gilman reagent, `Me2CuLi`. The outcome is governed by two explicit rules.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity - Determining the Site of Attack**\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻`) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` indicates that C1 has a methyl group attached. This makes it a highly substituted, quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon has no substituent mentioned in the name, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a less substituted, tertiary-like carbon center.\n*   **Conclusion:** Comparing a carbon attached to a methyl group (C1) with one attached to a hydrogen atom (C6), C6 is unequivocally less sterically hindered. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Product Connectivity and IUPAC Naming**\n\nThe site of attack determines the product's basic structure and name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group is formed on C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   To name the resulting cyclohexanol, the carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. The ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (original C6) to give the lowest substituent numbers. This makes the original C6 the new C2.\n*   The four methyl groups end up on positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would imply attack at C1).\n\n**Careful Point 3: Stereoselectivity - Determining the Final Configuration**\n\nThe second rule states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n*   Inversion of the (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   In the product's name, the original C6 carbon corresponds to the **new C2 position**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters that were not involved in the reaction retain their configurations.\n\n**Final Product Identification**\n\nCombining all points, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nMatching this to the provided options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This perfectly matches the derived product in both base name and stereochemistry (`2R`).\n*   **B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name but the incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (`2S`), which would imply retention of configuration, violating the rules.\n*   **C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has an incorrect base name.\n*   **D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has an incorrect base name.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis organic chemistry problem requires a systematic application of two rules provided for the reaction between a substituted epoxide and an organocuprate reagent. The consensus among the provided candidate answers on the chemical logic is very strong, indicating a clear, single correct product. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to variations in the multiple-choice option lists.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product based on the specific options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity: Where does the nucleophile attack?**\n    *   **The Rule:** The problem states the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   **The Reactant:** The epoxide ring in `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon C1 is bonded to a methyl group (making it a sterically hindered, quaternary-like carbon), while carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom (making it a less hindered, tertiary-like carbon).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The primary factor for determining the site of attack is steric hindrance. A methyl group presents significantly more steric bulk than a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n2.  **Product Skeleton: What is the base name of the product?**\n    *   **The Reaction:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group is on C1, and the new methyl group is on C6.\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:** To name the resulting alcohol, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest numbers to substituents requires numbering toward the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is essential. The original C1 becomes the new C1, and the original C6 (the site of attack) becomes the new C2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have an incorrect `2,2,4,5-` base name. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity: What is the configuration of the new stereocenter?**\n    *   **The Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** The attacked carbon is C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)** as given in the reactant's name `(...6S)-...`.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** It is crucial to perform the inversion (S becomes R) and map it to the correct carbon in the product's name (original C6 becomes new C2). A common error is to forget the inversion or to misidentify the product carbon number.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inversion of the (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration. Since this occurs at what is now C2 of the product, the product must have a **(2R)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nCombining all steps, the product must be **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Now we match this with the remaining options:\n\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This has an incorrect (2S) configuration, implying retention of configuration.\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This has the correct base name and the correct (2R) configuration from inversion.\n\nThe only option that satisfies all the rules of the reaction is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying the rules of organic chemistry. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the chemical principles, and the variation in their final letter choice is attributable to receiving different sets of options. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and leads to a single correct product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution can be found by methodically applying the two rules provided in the question.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity (Determining the Site of Attack)**\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance of C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group (as stated in the name `1-trimethyl...`). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and Me), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion**: The nucleophilic attack must occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Product Connectivity (Determining the Base IUPAC Name)**\n\nThe site of attack determines the product's fundamental structure and its name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group forms on C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the primary functional group (-OH) becomes the new **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). The correct way to number is from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), making it the new **C2**.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion**: The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Based on this, we can eliminate options with an incorrect base name:\n    *   B) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n    *   D) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n*   The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Stereoselectivity (Determining the Final Stereochemistry)**\n\nThe final step is to apply the second rule: **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   The attacked carbon is **C6**.\n*   The configuration of the starting material at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(...,6S)-...`.\n*   An inversion of the (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   As established in Careful Point 2, the original C6 corresponds to the **C2** position in the product's IUPAC name.\n*   **Conclusion**: The product must have an **(R)** configuration at C2. The stereochemical descriptor will include **(2R)**. The other chiral centers, which were not part of the reaction, retain their configurations.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe are looking for the option that is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** and has a **(2R)** configuration. Let's compare the remaining options, A and C.\n\n*   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has an incorrect (2S) configuration at C2, which would imply retention of configuration, violating the given rule.\n*   C) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct base name and the correct **(2R)** configuration resulting from the required inversion.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly follows both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the correct product, highlighting the critical points in the reasoning process.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first and most important decision, governed by the rule that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n\n*   **The Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring connects carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   **Analysis of Steric Hindrance:**\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached (as per the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms), which is highly crowded.\n    *   **C6** has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less crowded than C1.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The primary factor for regioselectivity here is comparing the substitution on the epoxide carbons. A carbon with a methyl group (C1) is much more hindered than a carbon with a hydrogen atom (C6).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group from `Me₂CuLi` will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Base Name (IUPAC Nomenclature)**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's fundamental structure and its name.\n\n*   **Product Formation:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After a standard workup, the oxygen at C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   The carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). This is achieved by numbering from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6). Therefore, the original C6 becomes the new **C2**.\n    *   This numbering results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly applying IUPAC rules for naming the product is crucial. An incorrect numbering scheme (e.g., resulting from the assumption of an attack at C1) would lead to an incorrect base name like `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the correct stereoisomer based on the rule that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Resulting Configuration:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Mapping to Product Name:** As established in Step 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is critical to remember that the reaction causes an **inversion** (S becomes R) and to correctly identify that this change occurs at what becomes the C2 position in the product. A common mistake would be to assume retention of configuration (S remains S).\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its full stereochemical name will include **(2R)**. The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C4, C5) retain their original relative configurations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nWe are looking for the option that is named **(...,2R,...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Comparing the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the incorrect `(2S)` configuration, which implies retention.\n*   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct `(2R)` configuration, resulting from the required inversion of stereochemistry.\n\nThe logical application of the rules provided leads to (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers from other agents and a first-principles approach to the chemistry problem, here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules**\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide connects carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rules:** The problem explicitly provides two rules that govern the reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThis step decides where the new C-C bond will form.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance of these two carbons.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (from the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** According to Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and IUPAC Name**\nThe regioselectivity dictates the fundamental structure of the product.\n*   The nucleophilic attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1, and the new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) becomes **C1** of the product. To give substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered toward the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), making it the new **C2**.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions **1, 2, 4, and 5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This finding immediately eliminates options B and D from the provided list, as they have an incorrect `2,2,4,5-` skeleton.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis final step distinguishes between the remaining options, A and C.\n*   Rule 2 states that there is an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The configuration of the starting material at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n*   An inversion of the (S) stereocenter yields an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   As established in Step 3, the attacked carbon (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's IUPAC name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will include `(2R)`. The other unreacted stereocenters retain their configurations. The full name is therefore `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Decision**\nWe compare our derived product with the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has the correct base name and the required **(2R)** configuration from the inversion.\n*   **C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has a `(2S)` configuration, implying retention of stereochemistry, which violates Rule 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the less hindered carbon (C6, bonded to H) versus the more hindered one (C1, bonded to CH₃) as the site of attack for the Gilman reagent.\n2.  **Product Renumbering:** It is crucial to correctly apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the product. The carbon bearing the new alcohol group becomes C1, and the ring is numbered to give the lowest locants to the substituents. Failing to do this can lead to an incorrect base name.\n3.  **Stereochemistry Application:** One must correctly apply both parts of the stereochemistry rule: identify the starting configuration (**S** at C6) and perform the inversion (**R**). Then, this inverted configuration must be mapped to the correct carbon in the final product's name (C6 becomes **C2**).\n\nFollowing this rigorous, step-by-step analysis, the correct product is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the chemical problem and a synthesis of the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, the correct product can be determined. The logic across all provided answers is sound and consistent, with discrepancies in final letter choices likely stemming from variations in the multiple-choice option lists they were presented with.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules:**\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring, with the epoxide linking carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent that provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The question explicitly states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: Determining the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first and most critical decision. The outcome dictates the fundamental structure of the product.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` states that C1 has a methyl group attached. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to C2, C6, the oxygen, and another methyl group), which is sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary-like carbon (bonded to C1, C5, the oxygen, and a hydrogen), which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: Determining the Product's Base Name**\n\nThe site of attack determines the product's connectivity and its IUPAC name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an alcohol (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   According to IUPAC naming rules for alcohols, the carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes C1 of the product. The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest possible numbers, which is achieved by numbering towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6). This makes the original C6 the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This finding immediately eliminates options with an incorrect name resulting from an attack at C1. Looking at the provided options:\n    *   C) `(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` is incorrect.\n    *   D) `(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` is incorrect.\n    *   The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: Determining the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis final step distinguishes between the remaining options A and B by applying the second rule.\n*   **Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Site of Attack:** Carbon **C6**.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)...`, so the absolute configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Resulting Configuration:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Position in Product:** As determined in the previous step, the original C6 is renumbered as **C2** in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. The stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters, which were not attacked, retain their configurations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe final product must be named `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. We compare this to the remaining options:\n*   A) `(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Has an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, implying retention.\n*   B) `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - This has the correct base name and the correct `(2R)` configuration resulting from the required inversion.\n\nTherefore, the only product that correctly follows both given rules is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a multistep organic chemistry problem requiring a systematic application of the two rules provided for the epoxide ring-opening reaction. The reasoning from the candidate answers is highly consistent and logically sound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Has a methyl group attached, as indicated by the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name. This makes it a quaternary-like, sterically crowded carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Has a hydrogen atom attached (as no other substituent is named). This makes it a tertiary-like, significantly less crowded carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The most critical first step is correctly identifying the steric environment of C1 and C6. The methyl group on C1 makes it much more hindered than C6, directing the attack of the Gilman reagent to C6.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base IUPAC Name**\nThe site of attack determines the product's fundamental structure.\n*   Attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group forms on C1, and the new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give substituents the lowest possible numbers. Numbering from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6) makes it the new C2.\n*   This results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options **C** and **D**, which have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would result from an incorrect attack at C1).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** It is crucial to correctly renumber the product ring according to IUPAC rules. The attacked carbon (original C6) becomes C2 in the product, not C6. The hydroxyl-bearing carbon (original C1) becomes C1 in the product. Getting this remapping wrong leads to an incorrect name.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\nThe second rule states there is an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(...,6S)-...`.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration at the reaction site yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   Since the original C6 corresponds to the **C2** position in the product, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The stereochemical descriptor for the product will include **(2R)**. The other chiral centers, which were not involved in the reaction, retain their original configuration relative to the ring.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Forgetting to invert the stereochemistry (i.e., S → S instead of S → R) is a common error. Equally important is correctly mapping the changed stereocenter (C6 in the reactant) to its new position in the product's name (C2).\n\n### Final Decision\nCombining the conclusions from all three steps, the correct product must be:\n*   Named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Have an **(R) configuration at position 2**.\n\nLet's examine the options provided in the question:\nA) `(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (S instead of R).\nB) `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - **Correct base name and correct (2R) stereochemistry.**\nC) `(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Incorrect base name.\nD) `(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Incorrect base name.\n\nThe analysis unequivocally identifies (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol as the correct product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a problem involving the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring by a Gilman reagent. To find the correct product, we must apply the two rules provided in the question: one for regioselectivity and one for stereoselectivity. An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical principles, which can be synthesized into a single, decisive logical path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The question states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide in `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis of Steric Hindrance:**\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly indicates a methyl group is attached to C1. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** No substituent is named at this position, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically crowded than C1.\n*   **Careful Point #1:** It is crucial to correctly identify the less hindered carbon. A common mistake would be to misinterpret the structure or ignore the steric effect of the methyl group on C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base Name (IUPAC Nomenclature)**\n\n*   **Process:** The nucleophilic attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the primary functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   **Careful Point #2:** The product must be named correctly according to IUPAC rules. The correct numbering results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Elimination of Options:** This conclusion immediately invalidates options with a different base name, which would result from an incorrect site of attack.\n    *   A) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n    *   B) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n*   The correct answer must be either **C** or **D**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Rule:** The question states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The site of attack is **C6**.\n    *   The starting material's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) stereocenter yields an **(R)** stereocenter.\n    *   As established in Step 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes **C2** in the product's name.\n*   **Careful Point #3:** It is essential to apply the *inversion* rule (S becomes R) and correctly map the location from the reactant (C6) to the product (C2). Choosing the option corresponding to *retention* (S becomes S) would be incorrect.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2, and its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nWe are looking for the option with the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and a `(2R)` stereochemical descriptor. Let's compare the remaining options:\n\n*   **C)** (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct name but an incorrect (2S) configuration, implying retention.\n*   **D)** (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct base name **and** the correct (2R) configuration resulting from the required inversion.\n\nThe systematic application of the provided rules unequivocally identifies the product as (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem asks to predict the product of a reaction between a substituted epoxide, `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, and an organocuprate reagent, `Me2CuLi`. The question provides two explicit rules to follow, one for regioselectivity and one for stereoselectivity. A step-by-step analysis is required to correctly apply these rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from the organocuprate) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Substrate Analysis:** The epoxide ring in the substrate involves carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly indicates that C1 has a methyl group attached. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** No substituent is mentioned at C6, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes C6 a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically crowded than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following the rule, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered **C6**.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Correctly identifying C6 as the less hindered carbon is the first and most crucial step. An incorrect choice here would lead to the wrong product skeleton entirely.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After an aqueous workup (implied in such reactions), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** The resulting product is a cyclohexanol. For naming purposes, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant becomes C1 of the product. The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), which is achieved by numbering from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (original C6). Thus, the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The four methyl groups are located at positions 1 (from the original C1), 2 (newly added), 4 (from the original C4), and 5 (from the original C3). Therefore, the correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Applying the IUPAC rules correctly to name the new structure is essential. This analysis eliminates options with a different base name, which would arise from an incorrect regiochemical prediction. Options B and D, with the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, are therefore incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The site of attack is **C6**.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n    *   Inversion of the (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n    *   In the product's IUPAC name, the carbon that was attacked (original C6) is renumbered as **C2**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters that were not involved in the ring-opening reaction retain their configurations.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is critical to remember to *invert* the configuration (S becomes R) and to correctly map the location of this change from the reactant (C6) to the product (C2). Simple retention of configuration is a common error that must be avoided.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct product must satisfy the following criteria:\n1.  Its base name is `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. (Eliminates B and D).\n2.  It has an (R) configuration at position 2. (Distinguishes between A and C).\n\nComparing the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name and the required `(2R)` configuration resulting from the inversion.\n*   **C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name but an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, violating the given rule.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the product derived from the systematic application of the reaction rules is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step application of the two rules provided for the reaction of an organocuprate with an epoxide.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction and Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide connects carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent that provides a \"soft\" nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Product**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first and most critical decision. The reaction's regioselectivity is determined by steric hindrance, as per Rule 1.\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (from the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name), making it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n*   **C6** is substituted only with a hydrogen atom (as no substituent is named at this position). This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less sterically crowded than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following Rule 1, the nucleophilic `Me⁻` group attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Determine the Product's Base Name (Connectivity & Nomenclature)**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's structure and its IUPAC name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   The ring must then be numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). The correct path is to number from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon, making the original C6 the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four total methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options **B** and **D**, as they have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, which would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\nThe final choice between A and C depends on applying Rule 2: inversion of configuration.\n*   The rule is applied to the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. As determined in Step 1, this is **C6**.\n*   The stereochemistry of C6 in the starting material is given as **(S)** in the name `(...,6S)-...`.\n*   An inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   As established in Step 2, the original C6 carbon corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters, not being involved in the reaction, retain their configurations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nWe are looking for the option that matches both the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and the stereodescriptor `(1R,2R,4R,5R)`.\nLet's check the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name but an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, violating Rule 2.\n*   **C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name **and** the correct `(2R)` configuration resulting from the inversion of the (6S) center.\n\nThe systematic application of the given rules unequivocally leads to this product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a multistep organic chemistry problem involving a regioselective and stereoselective epoxide ring-opening reaction. A thorough analysis requires the systematic application of the two rules provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n*   **Analysis of Epoxide Carbons:** The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly indicates that C1 is attached to a methyl group. This makes it a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** No substituent is named at this position, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The primary decision is comparing the steric bulk of a methyl group versus a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom presents a much smaller obstacle to the incoming nucleophile.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Base Name**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the final structure of the product.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms on C1, and the new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n    2.  The ring is numbered to give all substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). The correct path is to number from the new C1 towards the adjacent carbon where the new methyl group was added. Therefore, the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n    3.  This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is critical. An incorrect path or starting point would lead to a different, incorrect base name (like `2,2,4,5-...`, which would imply attack at C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options with a different base name, such as A and D. The correct answer must be B or C.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final step is to apply the second rule: **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added.\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Position in Product:** As determined in Step 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's IUPAC name.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is crucial to correctly perform the inversion (S → R) and map it to the right carbon in the product's name (C6 in reactant → C2 in product). A common error is to assume retention of configuration (S → S).\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, written as `(2R)`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nCombining the conclusions from all steps, the correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. We now match this to the remaining options:\n\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — *Incorrect base name.*\n*   B) **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** — **This matches our derived structure perfectly.** It has the correct base name and the required `(2R)` configuration.\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — *Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.* This `(2S)` implies retention of configuration, which violates the given rule.\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — *Incorrect base name and stereochemistry.*\n\nThe systematic application of the provided rules leads to only one possible product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires the strict application of two rules for an epoxide ring-opening reaction. The analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning, despite their different final letter choices (which likely results from seeing scrambled options). The following step-by-step analysis consolidates this consensus logic to arrive at the correct answer for the provided option list.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack\n*   **The Rule:** The question states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **The Substrate:** The epoxide ring in `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (as per the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name), making it a sterically crowded, quaternary-like carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with only a hydrogen atom (since no substituent is named at this position), making it a less crowded, tertiary-like carbon center.\n*   **Careful Point:** The primary factor determining the site of attack for a Gilman reagent on an epoxide is steric hindrance. A hydrogen atom is significantly smaller than a methyl group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack must occur at **C6**.\n\n#### 2. Product Skeleton: Determining the IUPAC Base Name\n*   **The Process:** The nucleophilic attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group is formed on C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the main functional group (-OH) is numbered as **C1** in the product. To give substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered toward the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new **C2**.\n*   **Analysis:** This numbering scheme places the four total methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is essential. A common mistake is to misidentify the locants of the substituents.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates any options with a different carbon skeleton, such as options A and D in the list which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n\n#### 3. Stereoselectivity: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n*   **The Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **The Process:** The attacked carbon is C6, which has a starting configuration of **(S)**, as given in the reactant name `(...6S)-...`.\n*   **Analysis:** The inversion of an (S) stereocenter yields an (R) stereocenter. Since the original C6 carbon becomes the new C2 carbon in the product's name, the product must have an (R) configuration at C2.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to remember both to invert the configuration (S → R) and to correctly map the location of this change from the reactant (C6) to the product (C2). Retention of configuration (S → S) is a common error.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product's name must contain the stereodescriptor **(2R)**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct product must satisfy three criteria:\n1.  Result from attack at C6.\n2.  Have the base name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n3.  Have an (R) configuration at C2, i.e., contain `(2R)`.\n\nLet's evaluate the options from the question:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect base name.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Correct base name, but incorrect `(2S)` stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention, not inversion).\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Correct base name and correct `(2R)` stereochemistry at C2. The other stereocenters are also consistent.\n*   D) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect base name.\n\nThe only option that matches all derived chemical principles is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of an epoxide ring-opening reaction, governed by explicit rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. All provided candidate answers follow a consistent and correct line of chemical reasoning, even though their final letter choices differ, which strongly indicates they were presented with shuffled option lists. The following analysis synthesizes this unanimous reasoning and applies it to the specific option list in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **1. Analysis of the Reaction Principles**\n*   **Reactants:** The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, and the reagent is `Me₂CuLi`, which provides a methyl nucleophile (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n#### **2. Careful Point 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThis is the first critical decision. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly states that a methyl group is attached to C1. This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is not specified to have a substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following Rule 1, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n#### **3. Careful Point 2: Determine the Product's Base Name (Connectivity)**\nThe site of attack determines the product's fundamental structure and its IUPAC name.\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an alcohol (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes C1 of the product. The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest locants, so the numbering proceeds towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6). This makes the original C6 the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis allows us to immediately eliminate options based on their names:\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-**1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> Correct base name.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-**1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> Correct base name.\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> **Incorrect** base name.\n*   D) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> **Incorrect** base name.\nThe answer must be either A or B.\n\n#### **4. Careful Point 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\nThe final choice between A and B depends on Rule 2.\n*   The reaction occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The starting material's name, `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`, specifies the configuration at C6 as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration at the reaction center results in an **(R)** configuration.\n*   As established in Careful Point 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes **C2** in the product's name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its full stereochemical name will contain the descriptor **(2R)**.\n\n#### **5. Final Decision**\nWe are looking for the option with the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and a `(2R)` configuration. Let's compare the remaining options, A and B.\n\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has the correct base name and the required **(2R)** configuration resulting from the inversion of stereochemistry.\n*   **B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has the correct base name but the incorrect **(2S)** configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, directly contradicting the given rules.\n\nTherefore, the only product that correctly follows both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity rules is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This problem requires a three-step analysis based on the provided rules for the ring-opening of an epoxide by a Gilman reagent. The consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers is exceptionally strong and logically sound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The nucleophile (methyl anion from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Analysis:** The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring connects carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon **C1** is specified in the name (`1-trimethyl...`) as having a methyl group substituent, making it a highly substituted and sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   Carbon **C6** has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it significantly less sterically hindered.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at carbon **C6**.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the IUPAC name to identify the substituents on the epoxide carbons. The methyl group on C1 is the key determinant for the regioselectivity.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After an implied workup step, the oxygen atom (on C1) is protonated to form an alcohol (-OH), and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** To name the resulting cyclohexanol, the carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) must be given the lowest possible number. This carbon, the original C1, becomes the new C1. To give the other substituents the lowest numbers, the ring is numbered from the new C1 towards the adjacent, newly-methylated carbon (the original C6). Thus, the original C6 becomes the new C2. This numbering places the four total methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is essential. This conclusion immediately eliminates options A and B, which have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would imply attack at the more hindered C1).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The site of attack is carbon **C6**.\n    *   The starting material's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   Inversion of this (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n    *   As established in Step 2, the carbon that was attacked (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. The configurations of the other stereocenters (1, 4, and 5) are unaffected by the reaction and remain R.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is vital to apply the *inversion* rule (S becomes R) and to correctly map the location of this change from the reactant (C6) to its new position in the product's name (C2). Choosing the option with a (2S) configuration would imply retention of stereochemistry, which is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe final product must be **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- Incorrect base name.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- Incorrect base name.\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- Correct base name, but incorrect (2S) stereochemistry (implies retention).\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol --- **Correct base name and correct (2R) stereochemistry from inversion.**\n\n<<<D>>>"

This is the most crucial step for determining the product's basic structure.\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis:** We must compare the steric environment of C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly states that a methyl group is attached to C1.

After an implicit workup step, the oxygen on C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   To name the resulting alcohol via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the primary functional group (-OH) is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To assign the lowest possible numbers (locants) to the substituents, the ring is numbered from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions **1, 2, 4, and 5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This allows us to eliminate options with an incorrect name. From the provided list:\n    *   A) `...2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   D) `...2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Determine the Final Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final step is to apply the second rule: **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.

An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning, which will be followed here. The final answer is determined by applying this logic to the specific list of options in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first rule provided is that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis of hindrance:**\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached (as per the `1,3,4-trimethyl...` name), making it a sterically crowded, quaternary-like carbon center.\n    *   **C6** has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a significantly less hindered, tertiary-like carbon center.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the IUPAC name to identify the substituents on the epoxide ring. The methyl group on C1 is the key factor making it more hindered than C6.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Base Name (Connectivity)**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's fundamental structure and its IUPAC name.\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, this results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 and a newly added methyl group at C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexanol. The carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered **C1** (this corresponds to the original C1). The ring is numbered towards the adjacent, newly methylated carbon (the original C6) to give the lowest locants. This makes the original C6 the new **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Applying IUPAC nomenclature correctly is essential. An incorrect numbering, or assuming the wrong site of attack, would lead to an incorrect base name like `2,2,4,5-...`. The correct analysis shows the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name for the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options with a different carbon skeleton:\n    *   A) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect**\n    *   C) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect**\n    \nThe correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\nThe second rule states that an **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added.\n\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name specifies the configuration at C6 is **(S)** (`...6S...`).\n*   **Final Configuration:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter yields an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is critical to remember to perform the inversion (S → R) and correctly map the carbon from the reactant to the product. In the product's name, the original C6 becomes C2. Forgetting to invert (S → S) or misidentifying the product carbon would lead to the wrong stereoisomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its stereochemical name will contain `(2R)`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nCombining the conclusions from all three steps, the correct product must be:\n*   Named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Have an **(R) configuration at C2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Has an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, implying retention.\n*   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Has the correct base name and the required `(2R)` configuration from the inversion.\n\nThe systematic application of the provided rules unequivocally identifies (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol as the correct product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the chemical problem and the consistent reasoning presented in the candidate answers, the correct product can be determined through a step-by-step application of the given rules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, by a Gilman reagent, `Me2CuLi`. The outcome is governed by two explicit rules.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity - Determining the Site of Attack**\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻`) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` indicates that C1 has a methyl group attached. This makes it a highly substituted, quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon has no substituent mentioned in the name, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a less substituted, tertiary-like carbon center.\n*   **Conclusion:** Comparing a carbon attached to a methyl group (C1) with one attached to a hydrogen atom (C6), C6 is unequivocally less sterically hindered. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Product Connectivity and IUPAC Naming**\n\nThe site of attack determines the product's basic structure and name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group is formed on C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   To name the resulting cyclohexanol, the carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. The ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (original C6) to give the lowest substituent numbers. This makes the original C6 the new C2.\n*   The four methyl groups end up on positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would imply attack at C1).\n\n**Careful Point 3: Stereoselectivity - Determining the Final Configuration**\n\nThe second rule states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n*   Inversion of the (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   In the product's name, the original C6 carbon corresponds to the **new C2 position**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters that were not involved in the reaction retain their configurations.\n\n**Final Product Identification**\n\nCombining all points, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nMatching this to the provided options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This perfectly matches the derived product in both base name and stereochemistry (`2R`).\n*   **B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name but the incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (`2S`), which would imply retention of configuration, violating the rules.\n*   **C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has an incorrect base name.\n*   **D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has an incorrect base name.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis organic chemistry problem requires a systematic application of two rules provided for the reaction between a substituted epoxide and an organocuprate reagent. The consensus among the provided candidate answers on the chemical logic is very strong, indicating a clear, single correct product. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to variations in the multiple-choice option lists.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product based on the specific options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity: Where does the nucleophile attack?**\n    *   **The Rule:** The problem states the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   **The Reactant:** The epoxide ring in `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon C1 is bonded to a methyl group (making it a sterically hindered, quaternary-like carbon), while carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom (making it a less hindered, tertiary-like carbon).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The primary factor for determining the site of attack is steric hindrance. A methyl group presents significantly more steric bulk than a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n2.  **Product Skeleton: What is the base name of the product?**\n    *   **The Reaction:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group is on C1, and the new methyl group is on C6.\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:** To name the resulting alcohol, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest numbers to substituents requires numbering toward the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is essential. The original C1 becomes the new C1, and the original C6 (the site of attack) becomes the new C2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have an incorrect `2,2,4,5-` base name. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity: What is the configuration of the new stereocenter?**\n    *   **The Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** The attacked carbon is C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)** as given in the reactant's name `(...6S)-...`.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** It is crucial to perform the inversion (S becomes R) and map it to the correct carbon in the product's name (original C6 becomes new C2). A common error is to forget the inversion or to misidentify the product carbon number.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inversion of the (S) configuration yields an **(R)** configuration. Since this occurs at what is now C2 of the product, the product must have a **(2R)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nCombining all steps, the product must be **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Now we match this with the remaining options:\n\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This has an incorrect (2S) configuration, implying retention of configuration.\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> This has the correct base name and the correct (2R) configuration from inversion.\n\nThe only option that satisfies all the rules of the reaction is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying the rules of organic chemistry. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the chemical principles, and the variation in their final letter choice is attributable to receiving different sets of options. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and leads to a single correct product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution can be found by methodically applying the two rules provided in the question.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity (Determining the Site of Attack)**\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance of C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group (as stated in the name `1-trimethyl...`). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and Me), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion**: The nucleophilic attack must occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Product Connectivity (Determining the Base IUPAC Name)**\n\nThe site of attack determines the product's fundamental structure and its name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group forms on C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the primary functional group (-OH) becomes the new **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). The correct way to number is from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), making it the new **C2**.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion**: The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Based on this, we can eliminate options with an incorrect base name:\n    *   B) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n    *   D) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n*   The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Stereoselectivity (Determining the Final Stereochemistry)**\n\nThe final step is to apply the second rule: **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   The attacked carbon is **C6**.\n*   The configuration of the starting material at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(...,6S)-...`.\n*   An inversion of the (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   As established in Careful Point 2, the original C6 corresponds to the **C2** position in the product's IUPAC name.\n*   **Conclusion**: The product must have an **(R)** configuration at C2. The stereochemical descriptor will include **(2R)**. The other chiral centers, which were not part of the reaction, retain their configurations.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe are looking for the option that is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** and has a **(2R)** configuration. Let's compare the remaining options, A and C.\n\n*   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has an incorrect (2S) configuration at C2, which would imply retention of configuration, violating the given rule.\n*   C) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct base name and the correct **(2R)** configuration resulting from the required inversion.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly follows both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the correct product, highlighting the critical points in the reasoning process.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first and most important decision, governed by the rule that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n\n*   **The Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide ring connects carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   **Analysis of Steric Hindrance:**\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached (as per the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms), which is highly crowded.\n    *   **C6** has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less crowded than C1.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The primary factor for regioselectivity here is comparing the substitution on the epoxide carbons. A carbon with a methyl group (C1) is much more hindered than a carbon with a hydrogen atom (C6).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group from `Me₂CuLi` will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Base Name (IUPAC Nomenclature)**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's fundamental structure and its name.\n\n*   **Product Formation:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After a standard workup, the oxygen at C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   The carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). This is achieved by numbering from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6). Therefore, the original C6 becomes the new **C2**.\n    *   This numbering results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly applying IUPAC rules for naming the product is crucial. An incorrect numbering scheme (e.g., resulting from the assumption of an attack at C1) would lead to an incorrect base name like `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the correct stereoisomer based on the rule that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Resulting Configuration:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Mapping to Product Name:** As established in Step 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is critical to remember that the reaction causes an **inversion** (S becomes R) and to correctly identify that this change occurs at what becomes the C2 position in the product. A common mistake would be to assume retention of configuration (S remains S).\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its full stereochemical name will include **(2R)**. The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C4, C5) retain their original relative configurations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nWe are looking for the option that is named **(...,2R,...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Comparing the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the incorrect `(2S)` configuration, which implies retention.\n*   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct `(2R)` configuration, resulting from the required inversion of stereochemistry.\n\nThe logical application of the rules provided leads to (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers from other agents and a first-principles approach to the chemistry problem, here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules**\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide connects carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rules:** The problem explicitly provides two rules that govern the reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThis step decides where the new C-C bond will form.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance of these two carbons.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (from the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name). This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6** is not mentioned as having a substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** According to Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Carbon Skeleton and IUPAC Name**\nThe regioselectivity dictates the fundamental structure of the product.\n*   The nucleophilic attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1, and the new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the principal functional group (-OH) becomes **C1** of the product. To give substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered toward the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), making it the new **C2**.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions **1, 2, 4, and 5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This finding immediately eliminates options B and D from the provided list, as they have an incorrect `2,2,4,5-` skeleton.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis final step distinguishes between the remaining options, A and C.\n*   Rule 2 states that there is an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The configuration of the starting material at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n*   An inversion of the (S) stereocenter yields an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   As established in Step 3, the attacked carbon (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's IUPAC name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will include `(2R)`. The other unreacted stereocenters retain their configurations. The full name is therefore `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Decision**\nWe compare our derived product with the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has the correct base name and the required **(2R)** configuration from the inversion.\n*   **C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has a `(2S)` configuration, implying retention of stereochemistry, which violates Rule 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the less hindered carbon (C6, bonded to H) versus the more hindered one (C1, bonded to CH₃) as the site of attack for the Gilman reagent.\n2.  **Product Renumbering:** It is crucial to correctly apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the product. The carbon bearing the new alcohol group becomes C1, and the ring is numbered to give the lowest locants to the substituents. Failing to do this can lead to an incorrect base name.\n3.  **Stereochemistry Application:** One must correctly apply both parts of the stereochemistry rule: identify the starting configuration (**S** at C6) and perform the inversion (**R**). Then, this inverted configuration must be mapped to the correct carbon in the final product's name (C6 becomes **C2**).\n\nFollowing this rigorous, step-by-step analysis, the correct product is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the chemical problem and a synthesis of the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, the correct product can be determined. The logic across all provided answers is sound and consistent, with discrepancies in final letter choices likely stemming from variations in the multiple-choice option lists they were presented with.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules:**\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring, with the epoxide linking carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent that provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The question explicitly states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: Determining the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first and most critical decision. The outcome dictates the fundamental structure of the product.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` states that C1 has a methyl group attached. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to C2, C6, the oxygen, and another methyl group), which is sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon has no specified substituent, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary-like carbon (bonded to C1, C5, the oxygen, and a hydrogen), which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following Rule 1, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: Determining the Product's Base Name**\n\nThe site of attack determines the product's connectivity and its IUPAC name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an alcohol (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   According to IUPAC naming rules for alcohols, the carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes C1 of the product. The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest possible numbers, which is achieved by numbering towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6). This makes the original C6 the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This finding immediately eliminates options with an incorrect name resulting from an attack at C1. Looking at the provided options:\n    *   C) `(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` is incorrect.\n    *   D) `(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` is incorrect.\n    *   The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: Determining the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis final step distinguishes between the remaining options A and B by applying the second rule.\n*   **Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Site of Attack:** Carbon **C6**.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)...`, so the absolute configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Resulting Configuration:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Position in Product:** As determined in the previous step, the original C6 is renumbered as **C2** in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. The stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters, which were not attacked, retain their configurations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe final product must be named `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. We compare this to the remaining options:\n*   A) `(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Has an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, implying retention.\n*   B) `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - This has the correct base name and the correct `(2R)` configuration resulting from the required inversion.\n\nTherefore, the only product that correctly follows both given rules is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a multistep organic chemistry problem requiring a systematic application of the two rules provided for the epoxide ring-opening reaction. The reasoning from the candidate answers is highly consistent and logically sound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** Has a methyl group attached, as indicated by the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name. This makes it a quaternary-like, sterically crowded carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** Has a hydrogen atom attached (as no other substituent is named). This makes it a tertiary-like, significantly less crowded carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The most critical first step is correctly identifying the steric environment of C1 and C6. The methyl group on C1 makes it much more hindered than C6, directing the attack of the Gilman reagent to C6.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base IUPAC Name**\nThe site of attack determines the product's fundamental structure.\n*   Attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group forms on C1, and the new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give substituents the lowest possible numbers. Numbering from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6) makes it the new C2.\n*   This results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options **C** and **D**, which have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (a name that would result from an incorrect attack at C1).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** It is crucial to correctly renumber the product ring according to IUPAC rules. The attacked carbon (original C6) becomes C2 in the product, not C6. The hydroxyl-bearing carbon (original C1) becomes C1 in the product. Getting this remapping wrong leads to an incorrect name.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\nThe second rule states there is an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the name `(...,6S)-...`.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration at the reaction site yields an **(R)** configuration.\n*   Since the original C6 corresponds to the **C2** position in the product, the product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The stereochemical descriptor for the product will include **(2R)**. The other chiral centers, which were not involved in the reaction, retain their original configuration relative to the ring.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Forgetting to invert the stereochemistry (i.e., S → S instead of S → R) is a common error. Equally important is correctly mapping the changed stereocenter (C6 in the reactant) to its new position in the product's name (C2).\n\n### Final Decision\nCombining the conclusions from all three steps, the correct product must be:\n*   Named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Have an **(R) configuration at position 2**.\n\nLet's examine the options provided in the question:\nA) `(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (S instead of R).\nB) `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - **Correct base name and correct (2R) stereochemistry.**\nC) `(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Incorrect base name.\nD) `(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` - Incorrect base name.\n\nThe analysis unequivocally identifies (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol as the correct product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a problem involving the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring by a Gilman reagent. To find the correct product, we must apply the two rules provided in the question: one for regioselectivity and one for stereoselectivity. An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical principles, which can be synthesized into a single, decisive logical path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The question states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide in `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis of Steric Hindrance:**\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly indicates a methyl group is attached to C1. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** No substituent is named at this position, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically crowded than C1.\n*   **Careful Point #1:** It is crucial to correctly identify the less hindered carbon. A common mistake would be to misinterpret the structure or ignore the steric effect of the methyl group on C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base Name (IUPAC Nomenclature)**\n\n*   **Process:** The nucleophilic attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the primary functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   **Careful Point #2:** The product must be named correctly according to IUPAC rules. The correct numbering results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Elimination of Options:** This conclusion immediately invalidates options with a different base name, which would result from an incorrect site of attack.\n    *   A) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n    *   B) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5**-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> **Incorrect name.**\n*   The correct answer must be either **C** or **D**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Rule:** The question states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The site of attack is **C6**.\n    *   The starting material's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) stereocenter yields an **(R)** stereocenter.\n    *   As established in Step 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes **C2** in the product's name.\n*   **Careful Point #3:** It is essential to apply the *inversion* rule (S becomes R) and correctly map the location from the reactant (C6) to the product (C2). Choosing the option corresponding to *retention* (S becomes S) would be incorrect.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2, and its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nWe are looking for the option with the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and a `(2R)` stereochemical descriptor. Let's compare the remaining options:\n\n*   **C)** (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct name but an incorrect (2S) configuration, implying retention.\n*   **D)** (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: This has the correct base name **and** the correct (2R) configuration resulting from the required inversion.\n\nThe systematic application of the provided rules unequivocally identifies the product as (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem asks to predict the product of a reaction between a substituted epoxide, `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, and an organocuprate reagent, `Me2CuLi`. The question provides two explicit rules to follow, one for regioselectivity and one for stereoselectivity. A step-by-step analysis is required to correctly apply these rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from the organocuprate) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Substrate Analysis:** The epoxide ring in the substrate involves carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly indicates that C1 has a methyl group attached. This makes C1 a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** No substituent is mentioned at C6, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes C6 a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically crowded than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following the rule, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered **C6**.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Correctly identifying C6 as the less hindered carbon is the first and most crucial step. An incorrect choice here would lead to the wrong product skeleton entirely.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Connectivity and Base IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After an aqueous workup (implied in such reactions), the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** The resulting product is a cyclohexanol. For naming purposes, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant becomes C1 of the product. The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), which is achieved by numbering from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon (original C6). Thus, the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The four methyl groups are located at positions 1 (from the original C1), 2 (newly added), 4 (from the original C4), and 5 (from the original C3). Therefore, the correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Applying the IUPAC rules correctly to name the new structure is essential. This analysis eliminates options with a different base name, which would arise from an incorrect regiochemical prediction. Options B and D, with the name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, are therefore incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The site of attack is **C6**.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)** in the reactant's name: `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`.\n    *   Inversion of the (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n    *   In the product's IUPAC name, the carbon that was attacked (original C6) is renumbered as **C2**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters that were not involved in the ring-opening reaction retain their configurations.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is critical to remember to *invert* the configuration (S becomes R) and to correctly map the location of this change from the reactant (C6) to the product (C2). Simple retention of configuration is a common error that must be avoided.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct product must satisfy the following criteria:\n1.  Its base name is `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. (Eliminates B and D).\n2.  It has an (R) configuration at position 2. (Distinguishes between A and C).\n\nComparing the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name and the required `(2R)` configuration resulting from the inversion.\n*   **C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name but an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, violating the given rule.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the product derived from the systematic application of the reaction rules is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step application of the two rules provided for the reaction of an organocuprate with an epoxide.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction and Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide connects carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent that provides a \"soft\" nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Product**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first and most critical decision. The reaction's regioselectivity is determined by steric hindrance, as per Rule 1.\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons **C1** and **C6**.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (from the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name), making it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n*   **C6** is substituted only with a hydrogen atom (as no substituent is named at this position). This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less sterically crowded than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following Rule 1, the nucleophilic `Me⁻` group attacks the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Determine the Product's Base Name (Connectivity & Nomenclature)**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the product's structure and its IUPAC name.\n*   Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   The ring must then be numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). The correct path is to number from the new C1 towards the newly methylated carbon, making the original C6 the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four total methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options **B** and **D**, as they have the incorrect base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, which would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity)**\n\nThe final choice between A and C depends on applying Rule 2: inversion of configuration.\n*   The rule is applied to the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. As determined in Step 1, this is **C6**.\n*   The stereochemistry of C6 in the starting material is given as **(S)** in the name `(...,6S)-...`.\n*   An inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   As established in Step 2, the original C6 carbon corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**. Its stereochemical descriptor will contain `(2R)`. The other stereocenters, not being involved in the reaction, retain their configurations.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nWe are looking for the option that matches both the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and the stereodescriptor `(1R,2R,4R,5R)`.\nLet's check the remaining options:\n*   **A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name but an incorrect `(2S)` configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, violating Rule 2.\n*   **C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This has the correct base name **and** the correct `(2R)` configuration resulting from the inversion of the (6S) center.\n\nThe systematic application of the given rules unequivocally leads to this product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a multistep organic chemistry problem involving a regioselective and stereoselective epoxide ring-opening reaction. A thorough analysis requires the systematic application of the two rules provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n*   **Analysis of Epoxide Carbons:** The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly indicates that C1 is attached to a methyl group. This makes it a quaternary-like carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group), which is sterically crowded.\n    *   **C6:** No substituent is named at this position, meaning it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The primary decision is comparing the steric bulk of a methyl group versus a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom presents a much smaller obstacle to the incoming nucleophile.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at **C6**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Base Name**\n\nThe site of attack dictates the final structure of the product.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms on C1, and the new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n    2.  The ring is numbered to give all substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). The correct path is to number from the new C1 towards the adjacent carbon where the new methyl group was added. Therefore, the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n    3.  This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is critical. An incorrect path or starting point would lead to a different, incorrect base name (like `2,2,4,5-...`, which would imply attack at C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options with a different base name, such as A and D. The correct answer must be B or C.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final step is to apply the second rule: **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added.\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n*   **Initial Configuration:** The reactant's name, `(...,6S)-...`, specifies that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Inversion of an (S) stereocenter results in an **(R)** stereocenter.\n*   **Position in Product:** As determined in Step 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) corresponds to the **C2** position in the final product's IUPAC name.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is crucial to correctly perform the inversion (S → R) and map it to the right carbon in the product's name (C6 in reactant → C2 in product). A common error is to assume retention of configuration (S → S).\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R) configuration at position 2**, written as `(2R)`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nCombining the conclusions from all steps, the correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. We now match this to the remaining options:\n\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — *Incorrect base name.*\n*   B) **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** — **This matches our derived structure perfectly.** It has the correct base name and the required `(2R)` configuration.\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — *Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.* This `(2S)` implies retention of configuration, which violates the given rule.\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — *Incorrect base name and stereochemistry.*\n\nThe systematic application of the provided rules leads to only one possible product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires the strict application of two rules for an epoxide ring-opening reaction. The analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning, despite their different final letter choices (which likely results from seeing scrambled options). The following step-by-step analysis consolidates this consensus logic to arrive at the correct answer for the provided option list.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack\n*   **The Rule:** The question states that the nucleophile (`Me⁻` from `Me₂CuLi`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **The Substrate:** The epoxide ring in `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group (as per the `1-trimethyl...` part of the name), making it a sterically crowded, quaternary-like carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with only a hydrogen atom (since no substituent is named at this position), making it a less crowded, tertiary-like carbon center.\n*   **Careful Point:** The primary factor determining the site of attack for a Gilman reagent on an epoxide is steric hindrance. A hydrogen atom is significantly smaller than a methyl group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic attack must occur at **C6**.\n\n#### 2. Product Skeleton: Determining the IUPAC Base Name\n*   **The Process:** The nucleophilic attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an -OH group is formed on C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the main functional group (-OH) is numbered as **C1** in the product. To give substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered toward the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new **C2**.\n*   **Analysis:** This numbering scheme places the four total methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** Correctly re-numbering the product ring according to IUPAC rules is essential. A common mistake is to misidentify the locants of the substituents.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates any options with a different carbon skeleton, such as options A and D in the list which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n\n#### 3. Stereoselectivity: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n*   **The Rule:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **The Process:** The attacked carbon is C6, which has a starting configuration of **(S)**, as given in the reactant name `(...6S)-...`.\n*   **Analysis:** The inversion of an (S) stereocenter yields an (R) stereocenter. Since the original C6 carbon becomes the new C2 carbon in the product's name, the product must have an (R) configuration at C2.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to remember both to invert the configuration (S → R) and to correctly map the location of this change from the reactant (C6) to the product (C2). Retention of configuration (S → S) is a common error.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product's name must contain the stereodescriptor **(2R)**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct product must satisfy three criteria:\n1.  Result from attack at C6.\n2.  Have the base name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n3.  Have an (R) configuration at C2, i.e., contain `(2R)`.\n\nLet's evaluate the options from the question:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect base name.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Correct base name, but incorrect `(2S)` stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention, not inversion).\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Correct base name and correct `(2R)` stereochemistry at C2. The other stereocenters are also consistent.\n*   D) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol — Incorrect base name.\n\nThe only option that matches all derived chemical principles is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of an epoxide ring-opening reaction, governed by explicit rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. All provided candidate answers follow a consistent and correct line of chemical reasoning, even though their final letter choices differ, which strongly indicates they were presented with shuffled option lists. The following analysis synthesizes this unanimous reasoning and applies it to the specific option list in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **1. Analysis of the Reaction Principles**\n*   **Reactants:** The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, and the reagent is `Me₂CuLi`, which provides a methyl nucleophile (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n*   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n#### **2. Careful Point 1: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThis is the first critical decision. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **Carbon C1:** The name `1,3,4-trimethyl...` explicitly states that a methyl group is attached to C1. This makes it a quaternary-like carbon center, which is sterically crowded.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is not specified to have a substituent, so it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. This makes it a tertiary-like carbon center, which is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Following Rule 1, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n#### **3. Careful Point 2: Determine the Product's Base Name (Connectivity)**\nThe site of attack determines the product's fundamental structure and its IUPAC name.\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, an alcohol (-OH) group forms at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 of the reactant becomes C1 of the product. The ring is numbered to give other substituents the lowest locants, so the numbering proceeds towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6). This makes the original C6 the new C2.\n*   This numbering scheme places the four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base name of the product must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis allows us to immediately eliminate options based on their names:\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-**1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> Correct base name.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-**1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> Correct base name.\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> **Incorrect** base name.\n*   D) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** -> **Incorrect** base name.\nThe answer must be either A or B.\n\n#### **4. Careful Point 3: Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\nThe final choice between A and B depends on Rule 2.\n*   The reaction occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack.\n*   The site of attack is **C6**.\n*   The starting material's name, `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-...`, specifies the configuration at C6 as **(S)**.\n*   Inversion of the (S) configuration at the reaction center results in an **(R)** configuration.\n*   As established in Careful Point 2, the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes **C2** in the product's name.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product must have an **(R)** configuration at position 2. Its full stereochemical name will contain the descriptor **(2R)**.\n\n#### **5. Final Decision**\nWe are looking for the option with the name `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and a `(2R)` configuration. Let's compare the remaining options, A and B.\n\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has the correct base name and the required **(2R)** configuration resulting from the inversion of stereochemistry.\n*   **B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This has the correct base name but the incorrect **(2S)** configuration, which would imply retention of stereochemistry, directly contradicting the given rules.\n\nTherefore, the only product that correctly follows both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity rules is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
