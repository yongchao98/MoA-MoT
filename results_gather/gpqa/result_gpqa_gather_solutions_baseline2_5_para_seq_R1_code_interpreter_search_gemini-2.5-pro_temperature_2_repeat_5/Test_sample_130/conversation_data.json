Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two signals at 137 ppm for vinylic carbons and 165 ppm for carbonyl carbons) unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry of the molecule is responsible for the simple spectra. This point is correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is also unanimously agreed upon.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry\n*   **Careful Point 1: This is the most critical decision in the analysis.** The interpretation of the NMR data depends entirely on correctly identifying the structure of the major product.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*. The general \"Alder-Endo Rule\" suggests the *endo* product is typically favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Recognizing exceptions to the general rule.** This specific reaction is a classic textbook exception. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to the four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach, the anhydride ring would experience severe steric hindrance from the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 of the diene.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction proceeds preferentially through the sterically less-hindered **exo** transition state. Therefore, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct. Nearly all candidate answers correctly reason through this critical exception.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understanding what NOESY shows.** A NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between protons that are physically close in 3D space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but **absent in the minor (*endo*) product**. This requires finding a proton-proton proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n\n### Step 4: Correlating Structure with NMR Signals\n*   **Careful Point 4: Assigning signals and visualizing the products.**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the product (`H_anhydride`), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is a proton on the C7-methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons from the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons from the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   **Spatial Analysis:**\n        *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** In this geometry, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid structure holds the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.**\n        *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** Here, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond, placing it far from the `H_bridge` protons. **The NOE cross-peak would be absent.** (Instead, a cross-peak between `H_anhydride` at ~3.5 ppm and `Me_vinyl` at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n*   and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - *This interaction is characteristic of the minor (endo) product.*\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nC) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches the interaction for the major (exo) product.**\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nThe analysis of the chemical reaction and spectroscopic data consistently and unequivocally points to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to the critical decision points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Careful Point**: The first step is to correctly identify the starting materials.\n*   **Dienophile**: The description of an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, coupled with the highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm), unambiguously identifies this reactant as **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry explains the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic for vinylic and carbonyl groups.\n*   **Diene**: This reactant is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a classic **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a simple addition.\n\n### **Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is the most critical chemical decision in the problem. The interpretation of the NMR data depends entirely on correctly identifying the major stereoisomer.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" generally predicts the *endo* product as the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing electronic interactions.\n*   **The Crucial Exception**: This general rule is frequently overridden by severe **steric hindrance**. The diene used here is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a significant steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach (where the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the diene). The *exo* approach avoids this clash and is therefore kinetically favored.\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to this overwhelming steric hindrance, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n### **Step 3: Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point**: It is essential to understand that a NOESY spectrum shows which protons are physically close in 3D space, irrespective of bonding.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a proton-proton spatial interaction that is **unique to the *exo* adduct**.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlating Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\n*   **Careful Point**: We must correctly assign the proton signals given in the options and then visualize their positions in the 3D structures of the *exo* and *endo* products.\n*   **Signal Assignments**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which we can label `H_anhydride`. They are strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is one of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge, which we can label `H_bridge`.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **Spatial Analysis**:\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-bridge. This rigid geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, so no cross-peak would appear between them. (Instead, a cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton.\n*   The corresponding NMR signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* endo product).\n\nThe correct answer is the option that describes the interaction between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\nThis is the foundational step and there is a clear consensus among all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has highly symmetric NMR spectra: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). These spectroscopic data are the definitive signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and requires careful consideration of competing factors.\n\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\":** This is a general principle stating that the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (and therefore major) product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's substituents.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Steric Hindrance Exception.** This rule is a guideline that is frequently superseded by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach (where the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the diene). The *exo* approach avoids this clash, has a lower activation energy, and is therefore the faster, kinetically controlled pathway.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule, and nearly all candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nThe question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understanding the NOESY Technique.** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment generates a cross-peak between the signals of two protons that are physically close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **Task:** We must identify a pair of protons that are close in space in the **major (*exo*) adduct** but far apart in the **minor (*endo*) adduct**.\n\n### Step 4: Correlating Structure, Signals, and the NOESY Data\nWe must first assign the proton signals and then visualize their locations in the 3D structures.\n\n*   **Signal Assignments:** Based on standard chemical shifts, integration, and multiplicity:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry holds the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the *opposite side* (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, and the corresponding cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor product, a cross-peak would instead appear between `H_anhydride` at ~3.5 ppm and `Me_vinyl` at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe unique NOESY cross-peak that identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  *(This interaction is characteristic of the MINOR, endo product)*\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  *(This interaction is characteristic of the MAJOR, exo product)*\n\nThe soundest chemical reasoning points unequivocally to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a multi-step chemical analysis, starting from reactant identification and moving through reaction stereochemistry to advanced NMR interpretation. The key to solving it is to follow the logic carefully at each stage.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Careful Point 1: Deciphering the Dienophile's Identity.** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid containing an alkene. The resulting anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra: a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This combination of origin (from a *cis* precursor) and spectroscopic data (high symmetry, characteristic chemical shifts) unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene:** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. All candidate answers correctly identified these points.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Most Critical Decision.** The entire problem hinges on correctly identifying the major product. Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** The general guideline (the \"Alder-Endo Rule\") predicts the *endo* isomer as the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Correct Analysis for this Specific Case:** The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. An *endo* approach would force the anhydride ring into a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore kinetically favored. This is a classic textbook example where steric hindrance controls the reaction's outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct. This conclusion is correctly reached in the reasoning of nearly all the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understanding the NOESY Experiment.** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between protons that are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding. We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n*   **Signal Assignment:** Based on chemical environment and integration values given in the options, we can assign the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data and Conclude\n*   **Careful Point 4: Visualizing the 3D Structures.**\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, \"tucked under\" the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would be present instead).\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The unique cross-peak for the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful evaluation of the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type\n**Careful Point**: The first step is to correctly identify the starting materials from the provided chemical and spectroscopic information.\n\n*   **The Dienophile**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) indicate a highly symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts correspond to vinylic protons/carbons and carbonyl carbons, respectively. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene**: This is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition of the two reactants has occurred (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry\n**Careful Point**: This is the most critical decision in solving the problem. The correct interpretation of the NOESY spectrum depends entirely on identifying the major stereoisomer.\n\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   There is a general guideline known as the \"Alder-Endo Rule,\" which predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this problem presents a classic exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach (where the anhydride tucks \"under\" the diene), the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 would create severe steric hindrance with the anhydride ring. The *exo* approach avoids this steric clash, making its transition state lower in energy.\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to this overwhelming steric hindrance, the reaction is kinetically controlled to form the **exo adduct as the major product** and the endo adduct as the minor product.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of NMR Signals and 2D NOESY Data\n**Careful Point**: A NOESY spectrum reveals which protons are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding. We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n\n*   **Signal Assignment**: Based on typical chemical shifts and the integrations given in the options, we can assign the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: One of the two protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n### Step 4: Correlating Structure with the Key NOESY Interaction\n**Careful Point**: It is essential to visualize the 3D structures of the major and minor products to determine which protons are close in space.\n\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). **Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked \"underneath\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. Instead, in this isomer, a cross-peak would be seen between **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (**Me_vinyl**, ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. The corresponding NMR signals for this interaction are:\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches the interaction characteristic of the major (*exo*) product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This is the interaction expected for the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identification of Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated.

Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Visualizing Spatial Proximity.**\n        *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are held very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.**\n        *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C7 bridge, tucked underneath the double bond.

(In this minor isomer, a strong NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This exact pair of resonances is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial decision points.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\nThis initial step is foundational and is correctly and unanimously identified across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, coupled with its highly symmetrical NMR spectra (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm), unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition of the reactants.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, as the interpretation of the NMR data depends on it.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: One must consider both electronic effects (the \"endo rule\") and steric effects. The Alder-endo rule suggests the *endo* product is typically favored kinetically. However, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis**: The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach, where the anhydride ring must pass under the diene system, a severe steric clash would occur between the anhydride ring and the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 of the diene.\n*   **Conclusion**: To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the reaction's outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    This conclusion is reached in the reasoning of every single one of the provided candidate answers, indicating a strong consensus.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   **Principle**: A Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment identifies protons that are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å), generating a cross-peak between their signals.\n*   **The Task**: We must find the cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlate Structure with NMR Signals**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: We must correctly assign the proton signals given in the options and then visualize their spatial relationships in the two different product structures.\n*   **Signal Assignments**: Based on chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity:\n    *   `~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`: The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule, which we'll call **H_anhydride**.\n    *   `~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond, which we'll call **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   `~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`: One of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge, which we'll call **H_bridge**.\n    *   `~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis**:\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: In this rigid structure, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these signals is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: Here, the anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the double bond, on the opposite side from the C7-bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. (Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** at ~3.5 ppm and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.

The diene is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach (where the anhydride ring tucks under the diene), the two methyl groups at C1 and C4 of the diene create a severe steric clash with the incoming anhydride ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed via the less-hindered *exo* transition state. Therefore, due to overwhelming steric factors, the stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**Careful Point 3: Correlate Structure with the 2D NOESY Spectrum.**\n*   A NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between protons that are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a proton-proton interaction that exists **only in the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Assign NMR Signals and Visualize the Key Interaction.**\n*   First, we must assign the signals given in the options to specific protons in the product structure:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**), highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n*   Next, we visualize the isomers:\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge.

(In this minor isomer, a cross-peak would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a careful synthesis of the provided information and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts correspond to vinylic and carbonyl groups, respectively. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is confirmed by the product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is a direct sum of the reactants' formulas (Maleic Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ + Diene C₉H₁₄).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product (Crucial Point)**\n\nThis is the most critical decision point. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"**: This general principle predicts that the *endo* isomer is usually the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the π-systems.\n*   **The Exception (Steric Hindrance)**: This rule is a guideline and is often overridden by significant steric effects. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky. During the *endo* approach (where the anhydride tucks underneath the diene), a severe steric clash would occur between the anhydride ring and the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   **Conclusion**: To avoid this strong steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds via the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals**\n\nA NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are physically close in space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n\n*   **Signal Assignments**: Based on the integrations and chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`**: The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which are strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**: One of the protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`**: The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm`**: The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data**\n\nNow, we visualize the spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C7 bridge, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This pair of signals is described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\nFirst, we must correctly identify the molecules involved and the chemical transformation they undergo.\n*   **The Dienophile:** The anhydride is formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are the definitive signature of **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry of this molecule results in the simple NMR spectra.\n*   **The Diene:** This reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition reaction has occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Major Product's Stereochemistry**\nThis is the most critical decision point in the analysis, as the rest of the problem depends on it.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   The general guiding principle, known as the \"Alder-Endo Rule,\" predicts that the *endo* product is typically favored kinetically due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor.** This reaction is a classic exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring would have to approach \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash and is therefore the lower-energy, kinetically favored pathway.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\nWe must now relate the structure of the major product to the NMR data.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understanding NOESY Data.** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are physically close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n*   Our task is to find a unique spatial proximity in the *exo* adduct that is not present in the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Correlate Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\nFinally, we must assign the proton signals and visualize their positions in the 3D structure of the major product.\n*   **Signal Assignments:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (`H_anhydride`). They are strongly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Visualizing 3D Spatial Proximity.**\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid bicyclic geometry holds the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.**\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the opposite side of the C7-bridge. The `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, and this NOESY peak would be absent. Instead, a cross-peak between `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_vinyl` (~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of this minor product.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. The NMR signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description precisely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the most chemically sound conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\nThis initial step is foundational and is correctly and unanimously identified across all provided candidate answers.\n*   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, coupled with the highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm for the alkene and 165 ppm for the carbonyls), unambiguously identifies the reactant as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and dictates the entire subsequent analysis.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** While a general principle (the \"endo rule\") predicts the *endo* product is often favored kinetically due to secondary orbital interactions, this rule is frequently superseded by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Careful Point 1 - Applying the Exception:** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. In the *endo* approach, where the anhydride ring must pass under the diene system, a severe steric clash would occur between the anhydride and the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this significant steric repulsion, making its transition state lower in energy and thus kinetically favored. This is a classic textbook example where steric factors control the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reasoning of the vast majority of the candidate agents correctly identifies this crucial exception. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\nThe goal is to interpret the provided NOESY data in the context of the determined product structures.\n*   **Principle:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding.\n*   **Problem Statement:** A cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   **Interpretation:** Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is **unique to the *exo* isomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlating Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 - Signal Assignment:** We must correctly assign the proton signals described in the options to their respective locations in the product.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 - Visualizing Spatial Proximity:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system, which places it on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into very close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, tucked underneath the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a strong NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these protons are:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this conclusion to the original options provided in the question:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm *(This interaction is characteristic of the minor, endo product)*\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nThe soundest line of reasoning, which is consistent across almost all candidate answers' detailed analyses, points unequivocally to the interaction described in Option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed from dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid containing an alkene. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) indicate a highly symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts are characteristic of vinylic and carbonyl groups, respectively. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem, as the answer depends on correctly identifying the major product's structure.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **Careful Point: Endo Rule vs. Steric Hindrance.** The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" is a general guideline predicting that the *endo* isomer is often the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is frequently superseded by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Conclusion:** The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky. The two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons) create a severe steric clash with the approaching maleic anhydride ring in the transition state leading to the *endo* product. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash, has a lower energy transition state, and is therefore kinetically favored. This reaction is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n*   **Principle:** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment reveals which protons are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), shown as a cross-peak connecting their signals.\n*   **The Question's Constraint:** We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**. Based on our analysis in Step 2, this means we must find a spatial interaction unique to the ***exo*** **isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assignment of NMR Signals and Correlation with Structure\nFirst, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to their respective positions in the symmetrical product structure.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding from two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNext, we visualize the spatial relationships in the two key isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are physically close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak between them would be absent. (In this isomer, a strong NOE would be observed between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl at ~1.7 ppm instead).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches the key interaction for the major (*exo*) product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Connects bridgehead methyl and bridge protons.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - Connects bridgehead and vinylic methyls.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n\nThere is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers on the initial setup.\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Its highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are the definitive signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly identifies the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is confirmed by the molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which represents a direct addition of the reactants.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\n\nThis is the most crucial step of the problem, and all provided answers correctly reason through it, even if some make mistakes in their final selection.\n*   **The General Rule vs. The Exception:** While the \"Alder-endo rule\" generally predicts the *endo* product as major due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions, this rule is often superseded by significant steric effects.\n*   **Careful Point - Steric Hindrance:** This specific reaction is a classic textbook example of steric hindrance controlling the outcome. The diene is exceptionally bulky. In the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride ring would tuck underneath the diene, causing a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction preferentially proceeds via the sterically less-hindered **exo** transition state. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals\n\nThe problem requires us to find a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. Based on Step 2, this means we must identify a spatial proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:** The signals described in the options can be assigned to protons in the symmetrical product based on standard chemical shift knowledge:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data\n\nThis step involves visualizing the 3D structures of the two isomers to determine which protons are close in space.\n*   **Major (*Exo*) Product:** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) very close to the bridge protons (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these signals.**\n*   **Minor (*Endo*) Product:** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond, on the opposite side from the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. Instead, in this minor product, a cross-peak would be seen between **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm), which corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the **major (*exo*) product** connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the signals at:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**\n\nNow, we match this result to the original options provided in the question:\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n**C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nThe correct option is C, as it accurately describes the interaction that is unique to the major product. Although many of the candidate answers made clerical errors when selecting the final letter, their underlying chemical reasoning was overwhelmingly consistent and sound, pointing directly to this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThis is a foundational step that all candidate answers correctly analyze.\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The resulting anhydride is highly symmetrical, evidenced by its simple NMR spectra: a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and only two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons). This information is the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene:** This reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Major Product (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point of the entire problem. The interpretation of the NMR data depends on correctly identifying the major product's structure.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can form two different stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Rule (Alder-Endo Rule):** Under typical conditions, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's pi system and the dienophile's substituents.\n*   **Careful Point: Recognizing Exceptions due to Steric Hindrance.** This general rule is frequently overridden by severe steric repulsion. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach from \"underneath\" the diene system, which would cause a significant steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because the *exo* approach is less sterically hindered, it has a lower activation energy and is therefore the major kinetic product. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the stereochemical outcome.\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) reveals protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å), resulting in a cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on Step 2, this means we must find a spatial interaction that is **unique to the *exo* adduct**.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with Specific NMR Signals\nFirst, we must assign the signals given in the options to the correct protons in the product's structure.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, we must visualize the 3D structures to identify the key NOE interaction.\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid bicyclic geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, so that specific cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor product, a cross-peak would instead appear between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton.\n*   The resonances for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this conclusion with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is the interaction characteristic of the minor, *endo* product).\n\nThe correct answer is B, as it accurately describes the interaction between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons in the major *exo* product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThis is the foundational step. The chemical description and spectroscopic data provided are designed to lead to a specific conclusion.\n*   **Careful Point**: Correctly interpret the spectroscopic data for the dienophile. A single `¹H NMR` peak at 7 ppm and two `¹³C NMR` peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) signify a molecule of high symmetry.\n*   **Analysis**: This data, combined with the description of dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactants**:\n    *   Dienophile: **Maleic Anhydride**\n    *   Diene: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a direct addition.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem, as it dictates the structure for the subsequent NMR analysis.\n*   **Careful Point**: Do not blindly apply the general \"endo rule.\" Always consider potential overriding factors like steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis**: The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*. The general \"Alder-Endo Rule\" favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is a guideline that is frequently superseded by steric effects. The diene in this problem is extremely bulky. The two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a significant steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during an *endo* approach. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore kinetically favored (has a lower energy transition state).\n*   **Conclusion**: This reaction is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the outcome.\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals\nA NOESY spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   **Careful Point**: The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. Based on our analysis in Step 2, we must look for a spatial interaction that is unique to the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   **Signal Assignment**: Based on chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`**: The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**: One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`**: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm`**: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data\nNow we visualize the two isomers to find the distinguishing spatial interaction.\n*   **Major (*Exo*) Adduct**: In this geometry, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) into very close proximity with the C7-bridge protons (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor (*Endo*) Adduct**: In this geometry, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a cross-peak would instead appear between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to an interaction between the resonances at:\n*   **`~1.5 ppm` (1H doublet)** and **`~3.5 ppm` (2H singlet)**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - **This perfectly matches our analysis.**\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - This connects a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This connects a bridgehead methyl and a vinylic methyl.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This interaction (`Me_vinyl` and `H_anhydride`) is characteristic of the *minor* (endo) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two signals at 137 ppm for vinylic carbons and 165 ppm for carbonyl carbons) unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry of the molecule is responsible for the simple spectra. This point is correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is also unanimously agreed upon.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry\n*   **Careful Point 1: This is the most critical decision in the analysis.** The interpretation of the NMR data depends entirely on correctly identifying the structure of the major product.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*. The general \"Alder-Endo Rule\" suggests the *endo* product is typically favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Recognizing exceptions to the general rule.** This specific reaction is a classic textbook exception. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to the four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach, the anhydride ring would experience severe steric hindrance from the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 of the diene.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction proceeds preferentially through the sterically less-hindered **exo** transition state. Therefore, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct. Nearly all candidate answers correctly reason through this critical exception.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understanding what NOESY shows.** A NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between protons that are physically close in 3D space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but **absent in the minor (*endo*) product**. This requires finding a proton-proton proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n\n### Step 4: Correlating Structure with NMR Signals\n*   **Careful Point 4: Assigning signals and visualizing the products.**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the product (`H_anhydride`), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is a proton on the C7-methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons from the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons from the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   **Spatial Analysis:**\n        *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** In this geometry, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid structure holds the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.**\n        *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** Here, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond, placing it far from the `H_bridge` protons. **The NOE cross-peak would be absent.** (Instead, a cross-peak between `H_anhydride` at ~3.5 ppm and `Me_vinyl` at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n*   and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - *This interaction is characteristic of the minor (endo) product.*\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nC) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches the interaction for the major (exo) product.**\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nThe analysis of the chemical reaction and spectroscopic data consistently and unequivocally points to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to the critical decision points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Careful Point**: The first step is to correctly identify the starting materials.\n*   **Dienophile**: The description of an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, coupled with the highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm), unambiguously identifies this reactant as **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry explains the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic for vinylic and carbonyl groups.\n*   **Diene**: This reactant is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a classic **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a simple addition.\n\n### **Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is the most critical chemical decision in the problem. The interpretation of the NMR data depends entirely on correctly identifying the major stereoisomer.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" generally predicts the *endo* product as the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing electronic interactions.\n*   **The Crucial Exception**: This general rule is frequently overridden by severe **steric hindrance**. The diene used here is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a significant steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach (where the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the diene). The *exo* approach avoids this clash and is therefore kinetically favored.\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to this overwhelming steric hindrance, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n### **Step 3: Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point**: It is essential to understand that a NOESY spectrum shows which protons are physically close in 3D space, irrespective of bonding.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a proton-proton spatial interaction that is **unique to the *exo* adduct**.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlating Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\n*   **Careful Point**: We must correctly assign the proton signals given in the options and then visualize their positions in the 3D structures of the *exo* and *endo* products.\n*   **Signal Assignments**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which we can label `H_anhydride`. They are strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is one of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge, which we can label `H_bridge`.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **Spatial Analysis**:\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-bridge. This rigid geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, so no cross-peak would appear between them. (Instead, a cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton.\n*   The corresponding NMR signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* endo product).\n\nThe correct answer is the option that describes the interaction between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\nThis is the foundational step and there is a clear consensus among all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has highly symmetric NMR spectra: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). These spectroscopic data are the definitive signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and requires careful consideration of competing factors.\n\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\":** This is a general principle stating that the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (and therefore major) product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's substituents.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Steric Hindrance Exception.** This rule is a guideline that is frequently superseded by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach (where the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the diene). The *exo* approach avoids this clash, has a lower activation energy, and is therefore the faster, kinetically controlled pathway.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule, and nearly all candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nThe question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understanding the NOESY Technique.** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment generates a cross-peak between the signals of two protons that are physically close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **Task:** We must identify a pair of protons that are close in space in the **major (*exo*) adduct** but far apart in the **minor (*endo*) adduct**.\n\n### Step 4: Correlating Structure, Signals, and the NOESY Data\nWe must first assign the proton signals and then visualize their locations in the 3D structures.\n\n*   **Signal Assignments:** Based on standard chemical shifts, integration, and multiplicity:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry holds the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the *opposite side* (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, and the corresponding cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor product, a cross-peak would instead appear between `H_anhydride` at ~3.5 ppm and `Me_vinyl` at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe unique NOESY cross-peak that identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  *(This interaction is characteristic of the MINOR, endo product)*\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  *(This interaction is characteristic of the MAJOR, exo product)*\n\nThe soundest chemical reasoning points unequivocally to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a multi-step chemical analysis, starting from reactant identification and moving through reaction stereochemistry to advanced NMR interpretation. The key to solving it is to follow the logic carefully at each stage.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Careful Point 1: Deciphering the Dienophile's Identity.** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid containing an alkene. The resulting anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra: a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This combination of origin (from a *cis* precursor) and spectroscopic data (high symmetry, characteristic chemical shifts) unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene:** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. All candidate answers correctly identified these points.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Most Critical Decision.** The entire problem hinges on correctly identifying the major product. Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** The general guideline (the \"Alder-Endo Rule\") predicts the *endo* isomer as the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Correct Analysis for this Specific Case:** The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. An *endo* approach would force the anhydride ring into a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore kinetically favored. This is a classic textbook example where steric hindrance controls the reaction's outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct. This conclusion is correctly reached in the reasoning of nearly all the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understanding the NOESY Experiment.** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between protons that are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding. We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n*   **Signal Assignment:** Based on chemical environment and integration values given in the options, we can assign the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data and Conclude\n*   **Careful Point 4: Visualizing the 3D Structures.**\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, \"tucked under\" the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would be present instead).\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The unique cross-peak for the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful evaluation of the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type\n**Careful Point**: The first step is to correctly identify the starting materials from the provided chemical and spectroscopic information.\n\n*   **The Dienophile**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) indicate a highly symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts correspond to vinylic protons/carbons and carbonyl carbons, respectively. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene**: This is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition of the two reactants has occurred (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry\n**Careful Point**: This is the most critical decision in solving the problem. The correct interpretation of the NOESY spectrum depends entirely on identifying the major stereoisomer.\n\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   There is a general guideline known as the \"Alder-Endo Rule,\" which predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this problem presents a classic exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach (where the anhydride tucks \"under\" the diene), the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 would create severe steric hindrance with the anhydride ring. The *exo* approach avoids this steric clash, making its transition state lower in energy.\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to this overwhelming steric hindrance, the reaction is kinetically controlled to form the **exo adduct as the major product** and the endo adduct as the minor product.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of NMR Signals and 2D NOESY Data\n**Careful Point**: A NOESY spectrum reveals which protons are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding. We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n\n*   **Signal Assignment**: Based on typical chemical shifts and the integrations given in the options, we can assign the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).

This rigid geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). **Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked \"underneath\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. Instead, in this isomer, a cross-peak would be seen between **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (**Me_vinyl**, ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton.

The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition of the reactants.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, as the interpretation of the NMR data depends on it.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: One must consider both electronic effects (the \"endo rule\") and steric effects. The Alder-endo rule suggests the *endo* product is typically favored kinetically. However, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis**: The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach, where the anhydride ring must pass under the diene system, a severe steric clash would occur between the anhydride ring and the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 of the diene.\n*   **Conclusion**: To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the reaction's outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    This conclusion is reached in the reasoning of every single one of the provided candidate answers, indicating a strong consensus.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   **Principle**: A Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment identifies protons that are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å), generating a cross-peak between their signals.\n*   **The Task**: We must find the cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlate Structure with NMR Signals**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: We must correctly assign the proton signals given in the options and then visualize their spatial relationships in the two different product structures.\n*   **Signal Assignments**: Based on chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity:\n    *   `~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`: The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule, which we'll call **H_anhydride**.\n    *   `~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond, which we'll call **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   `~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`: One of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge, which we'll call **H_bridge**.\n    *   `~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis**:\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: In this rigid structure, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these signals is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: Here, the anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the double bond, on the opposite side from the C7-bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. (Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** at ~3.5 ppm and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.

The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\nThere is unanimous consensus among all provided analyses on this point.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correctly Determine the Major Product's Stereochemistry.**\n*   **This is the most critical step.** The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general guideline stating that the *endo* product is often the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **The Overriding Factor: Steric Hindrance.** This problem presents a classic textbook exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the *endo* approach (where the anhydride ring tucks under the diene), the two methyl groups at C1 and C4 of the diene create a severe steric clash with the incoming anhydride ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed via the less-hindered *exo* transition state. Therefore, due to overwhelming steric factors, the stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**Careful Point 3: Correlate Structure with the 2D NOESY Spectrum.**\n*   A NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between protons that are physically close in 3D space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a proton-proton interaction that exists **only in the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Assign NMR Signals and Visualize the Key Interaction.**\n*   First, we must assign the signals given in the options to specific protons in the product structure:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**), highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n*   Next, we visualize the isomers:\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these signals is expected.\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. (In this minor isomer, a cross-peak would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a careful synthesis of the provided information and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts correspond to vinylic and carbonyl groups, respectively. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is confirmed by the product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is a direct sum of the reactants' formulas (Maleic Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ + Diene C₉H₁₄).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product (Crucial Point)**\n\nThis is the most critical decision point. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"**: This general principle predicts that the *endo* isomer is usually the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the π-systems.\n*   **The Exception (Steric Hindrance)**: This rule is a guideline and is often overridden by significant steric effects. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky. During the *endo* approach (where the anhydride tucks underneath the diene), a severe steric clash would occur between the anhydride ring and the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   **Conclusion**: To avoid this strong steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds via the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals**\n\nA NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are physically close in space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n\n*   **Signal Assignments**: Based on the integrations and chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`**: The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which are strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**: One of the protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`**: The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm`**: The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data**\n\nNow, we visualize the spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C7 bridge, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would be characteristic of this minor isomer).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This pair of signals is described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\nFirst, we must correctly identify the molecules involved and the chemical transformation they undergo.\n*   **The Dienophile:** The anhydride is formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are the definitive signature of **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry of this molecule results in the simple NMR spectra.\n*   **The Diene:** This reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition reaction has occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Major Product's Stereochemistry**\nThis is the most critical decision point in the analysis, as the rest of the problem depends on it.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   The general guiding principle, known as the \"Alder-Endo Rule,\" predicts that the *endo* product is typically favored kinetically due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor.** This reaction is a classic exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring would have to approach \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash and is therefore the lower-energy, kinetically favored pathway.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\nWe must now relate the structure of the major product to the NMR data.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understanding NOESY Data.** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are physically close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n*   Our task is to find a unique spatial proximity in the *exo* adduct that is not present in the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Correlate Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\nFinally, we must assign the proton signals and visualize their positions in the 3D structure of the major product.\n*   **Signal Assignments:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (`H_anhydride`). They are strongly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Visualizing 3D Spatial Proximity.**\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid bicyclic geometry holds the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.**\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the opposite side of the C7-bridge. The `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, and this NOESY peak would be absent. Instead, a cross-peak between `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_vinyl` (~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of this minor product.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. The NMR signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description precisely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the most chemically sound conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\nThis initial step is foundational and is correctly and unanimously identified across all provided candidate answers.\n*   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, coupled with the highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm for the alkene and 165 ppm for the carbonyls), unambiguously identifies the reactant as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and dictates the entire subsequent analysis.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** While a general principle (the \"endo rule\") predicts the *endo* product is often favored kinetically due to secondary orbital interactions, this rule is frequently superseded by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Careful Point 1 - Applying the Exception:** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. In the *endo* approach, where the anhydride ring must pass under the diene system, a severe steric clash would occur between the anhydride and the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this significant steric repulsion, making its transition state lower in energy and thus kinetically favored. This is a classic textbook example where steric factors control the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reasoning of the vast majority of the candidate agents correctly identifies this crucial exception. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\nThe goal is to interpret the provided NOESY data in the context of the determined product structures.\n*   **Principle:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding.\n*   **Problem Statement:** A cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   **Interpretation:** Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is **unique to the *exo* isomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Correlating Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 - Signal Assignment:** We must correctly assign the proton signals described in the options to their respective locations in the product.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 - Visualizing Spatial Proximity:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system, which places it on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into very close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, tucked underneath the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a strong NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these protons are:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this conclusion to the original options provided in the question:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm *(This interaction is characteristic of the minor, endo product)*\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nThe soundest line of reasoning, which is consistent across almost all candidate answers' detailed analyses, points unequivocally to the interaction described in Option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed from dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid containing an alkene. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) indicate a highly symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts are characteristic of vinylic and carbonyl groups, respectively. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem, as the answer depends on correctly identifying the major product's structure.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **Careful Point: Endo Rule vs. Steric Hindrance.** The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" is a general guideline predicting that the *endo* isomer is often the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is frequently superseded by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Conclusion:** The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky. The two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons) create a severe steric clash with the approaching maleic anhydride ring in the transition state leading to the *endo* product. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash, has a lower energy transition state, and is therefore kinetically favored. This reaction is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n*   **Principle:** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment reveals which protons are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), shown as a cross-peak connecting their signals.\n*   **The Question's Constraint:** We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**. Based on our analysis in Step 2, this means we must find a spatial interaction unique to the ***exo*** **isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assignment of NMR Signals and Correlation with Structure\nFirst, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to their respective positions in the symmetrical product structure.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding from two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNext, we visualize the spatial relationships in the two key isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are physically close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak between them would be absent. (In this isomer, a strong NOE would be observed between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl at ~1.7 ppm instead).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches the key interaction for the major (*exo*) product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Connects bridgehead methyl and bridge protons.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - Connects bridgehead and vinylic methyls.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n\nThere is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers on the initial setup.\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Its highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are the definitive signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly identifies the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is confirmed by the molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which represents a direct addition of the reactants.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\n\nThis is the most crucial step of the problem, and all provided answers correctly reason through it, even if some make mistakes in their final selection.\n*   **The General Rule vs. The Exception:** While the \"Alder-endo rule\" generally predicts the *endo* product as major due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions, this rule is often superseded by significant steric effects.\n*   **Careful Point - Steric Hindrance:** This specific reaction is a classic textbook example of steric hindrance controlling the outcome. The diene is exceptionally bulky. In the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride ring would tuck underneath the diene, causing a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction preferentially proceeds via the sterically less-hindered **exo** transition state. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals\n\nThe problem requires us to find a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. Based on Step 2, this means we must identify a spatial proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:** The signals described in the options can be assigned to protons in the symmetrical product based on standard chemical shift knowledge:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data\n\nThis step involves visualizing the 3D structures of the two isomers to determine which protons are close in space.\n*   **Major (*Exo*) Product:** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) very close to the bridge protons (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these signals.**\n*   **Minor (*Endo*) Product:** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond, on the opposite side from the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. Instead, in this minor product, a cross-peak would be seen between **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm), which corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the **major (*exo*) product** connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the signals at:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**\n\nNow, we match this result to the original options provided in the question:\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n**C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nThe correct option is C, as it accurately describes the interaction that is unique to the major product. Although many of the candidate answers made clerical errors when selecting the final letter, their underlying chemical reasoning was overwhelmingly consistent and sound, pointing directly to this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThis is a foundational step that all candidate answers correctly analyze.\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The resulting anhydride is highly symmetrical, evidenced by its simple NMR spectra: a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and only two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons). This information is the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene:** This reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Major Product (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point of the entire problem. The interpretation of the NMR data depends on correctly identifying the major product's structure.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can form two different stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Rule (Alder-Endo Rule):** Under typical conditions, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's pi system and the dienophile's substituents.\n*   **Careful Point: Recognizing Exceptions due to Steric Hindrance.** This general rule is frequently overridden by severe steric repulsion. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach from \"underneath\" the diene system, which would cause a significant steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because the *exo* approach is less sterically hindered, it has a lower activation energy and is therefore the major kinetic product. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the stereochemical outcome.\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) reveals protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å), resulting in a cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on Step 2, this means we must find a spatial interaction that is **unique to the *exo* adduct**.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with Specific NMR Signals\nFirst, we must assign the signals given in the options to the correct protons in the product's structure.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, we must visualize the 3D structures to identify the key NOE interaction.\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid bicyclic geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, so that specific cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor product, a cross-peak would instead appear between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton.\n*   The resonances for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this conclusion with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is the interaction characteristic of the minor, *endo* product).\n\nThe correct answer is B, as it accurately describes the interaction between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons in the major *exo* product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThis is the foundational step. The chemical description and spectroscopic data provided are designed to lead to a specific conclusion.\n*   **Careful Point**: Correctly interpret the spectroscopic data for the dienophile. A single `¹H NMR` peak at 7 ppm and two `¹³C NMR` peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) signify a molecule of high symmetry.\n*   **Analysis**: This data, combined with the description of dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactants**:\n    *   Dienophile: **Maleic Anhydride**\n    *   Diene: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a direct addition.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem, as it dictates the structure for the subsequent NMR analysis.\n*   **Careful Point**: Do not blindly apply the general \"endo rule.\" Always consider potential overriding factors like steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis**: The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*. The general \"Alder-Endo Rule\" favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is a guideline that is frequently superseded by steric effects. The diene in this problem is extremely bulky. The two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a significant steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during an *endo* approach. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore kinetically favored (has a lower energy transition state).\n*   **Conclusion**: This reaction is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the outcome.\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Assign Signals\nA NOESY spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   **Careful Point**: The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. Based on our analysis in Step 2, we must look for a spatial interaction that is unique to the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   **Signal Assignment**: Based on chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`**: The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**: One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`**: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **`6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm`**: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### Step 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data\nNow we visualize the two isomers to find the distinguishing spatial interaction.\n*   **Major (*Exo*) Adduct**: In this geometry, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) into very close proximity with the C7-bridge protons (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor (*Endo*) Adduct**: In this geometry, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a cross-peak would instead appear between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to an interaction between the resonances at:\n*   **`~1.5 ppm` (1H doublet)** and **`~3.5 ppm` (2H singlet)**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - **This perfectly matches our analysis.**\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - This connects a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This connects a bridgehead methyl and a vinylic methyl.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This interaction (`Me_vinyl` and `H_anhydride`) is characteristic of the *minor* (endo) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
