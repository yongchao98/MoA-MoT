This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis must consider several key stereochemical and dynamic principles.\n\n#### **Careful Points of Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not a rigid, static structure. At room temperature, it undergoes rapid conformational changes, a process known as \"pseudorotation\". Since this motion is much faster than the NMR timescale, the spectrum reflects a single, *time-averaged* structure. Analyzing a single \"frozen\" conformation would be incorrect and would lead to an overestimation of the number of signals.\n\n2.  **Plane of Symmetry:** This time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The two hydrogens attached to any single methylene (CH₂) group in the ring are **diastereotopic**. This means they are in chemically distinct environments because they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the chiral molecule (specifically, the substituent at C1). Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other, nor are those on C3, C4, or C5.\n\n#### **Systematic Count**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n*   **Type 1:** The single **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). It is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 type)**\n*   **Type 2:** The single **methine proton** on C1 (the ring carbon holding the aldehyde group). It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 type)**\n*   **Types 3 & 4:** The four protons on **C2 and C5**. The plane of symmetry makes these two carbon positions equivalent. However, the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its counterpart on C5, and the second proton on C2 to its partner on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from these four protons.\n*   **Types 5 & 6:** The four protons on **C3 and C4**. The same logic applies. The C3 and C4 positions are equivalent, and the protons on them are diastereotopic. These four protons form another **2 distinct types**, which are different from the protons on C2/C5 due to their different distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n\n**Final Tally:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methine C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Matching this number to the provided options:\nA) 6\nB) 10\nC) 7\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (Product 4)**\n\nFirst, it is essential to identify the final product by correctly tracing the four-step chemical synthesis. There is a strong and unanimous consensus among all provided candidate answers on this reaction pathway, which consists of well-established organic chemistry transformations.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This is an **α-bromination of a ketone**. A hydrogen on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    *   These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is the standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into a more reactive **acid chloride** using thionyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   This is a **selective reduction**. The reagent, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild, sterically hindered hydride source that reduces the reactive acid chloride to an **aldehyde**, stopping at that stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Conclusion of Part 1:** The final product is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. This analysis requires careful consideration of the following points:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not a rigid, flat structure. At room temperature, it undergoes very rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). Because NMR spectroscopy is a time-averaging technique on a slower timescale, it does not see a single \"frozen\" conformation. Instead, it observes a time-averaged structure which possesses higher symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry.** This time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** Even on carbons made equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 and C5), the two hydrogens on a single methylene (CH₂) group are **not** equivalent to each other. They are called **diastereotopic** because they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule (which contains a chiral center), and thus exist in different chemical environments.\n\n#### **Systematic Count**\n\nWe can now systematically count the unique hydrogen environments by combining these principles:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique environment.\n    *   **Count: 1 type**\n\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This is the single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is in its own unique environment.\n    *   **Count: 1 type**\n\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 to its partner on C5. Therefore, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **two distinct types**.\n    *   **Count: 2 types**\n\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons form another **two distinct types**. These are different from the types on C2/C5 due to their different distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n    *   **Count: 2 types**\n\n**Final Tally:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1 methine) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThe correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen atoms, we must first correctly identify the structure of the final product. This requires analyzing the four-step chemical synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is an α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2.** These conditions are characteristic of a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves an α-halo ketone reacting with a strong base, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted to a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a chlorine atom, yielding **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This reagent is a mild and sterically bulky reducing agent. It is specifically used to selectively reduce an acid chloride to an aldehyde while preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nConclusion: The final product, Product 4, is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n**2. Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the question is to analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde and count its number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments. This is equivalent to predicting the number of signals in its proton NMR spectrum. A careful analysis requires considering molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** Cyclopentane rings are not rigid or flat. At room temperature, they undergo rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). An NMR spectrometer operates on a slower timescale and therefore observes a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation. An analysis based on a single \"frozen\" structure would be incorrect.\n*   **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** Due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry** on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (the H, C, and O atoms), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of the aldehyde substituent on C1 means that the two hydrogens on any single methylene (`-CH₂-`) group in the ring are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically distinct from each other because they occupy non-equivalent positions relative to the rest of the chiral molecule.\n\n**Systematic Counting of Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n\nBy combining the principles of symmetry and diastereotopicity, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen types:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a completely unique chemical environment. (**1 type**)\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This is the single hydrogen on the ring carbon that is attached to the aldehyde group. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (**1 type**)\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (distinct). The plane of symmetry relates one proton on C2 to its counterpart on C5, and the *other* proton on C2 to *its* counterpart on C5. Thus, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **2 distinct types**.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types**, which are different from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different distance from the aldehyde group.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1 methine) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Based on the options provided:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 6\nD) 7\n\nThe correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first task is to identify the structure of the final product by correctly interpreting the four-step reaction sequence.

The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base leads to a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, forming **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** after an acidic workup (which is implied).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride using thionyl chloride. The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered hydride source that is selective for the reduction of a highly reactive acid chloride to an aldehyde, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.

This is equivalent to determining the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum under normal conditions. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's structure, symmetry, and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** It is a common mistake to analyze a single, static conformation of the cyclopentane ring. At room temperature, the five-membered ring is highly flexible and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as pseudorotation). An NMR experiment is time-averaged and observes a single structure that reflects the average of all these conformations.\n2.  **Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry:** This rapid conformational averaging results in the molecule possessing an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of a substituent on C1 means that the two hydrogens on any other single methylene (CH₂) group in the ring are chemically non-equivalent to each other.

These four protons form another **2 distinct types** (which are different from the protons on C2/C5 due to their different distance from the aldehyde group).\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe molecule has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

At room temperature, it undergoes very rapid conformational changes, a process known as \"pseudorotation.\" Since this process is much faster than the NMR measurement timescale, the spectrum reflects a single *time-averaged* structure. This averaged structure is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformation.\n\n2.  **Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry**: The time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n3.  **Diastereotopicity**: The presence of the aldehyde substituent on the ring means the two hydrogens on any single methylene (`-CH₂-`) group are **diastereotopic**. This means they are in chemically different environments because they have different spatial relationships to the substituent. For example, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other.\n\n**Systematic Counting of Distinct Hydrogens:**\n\nWe combine the principles of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity to count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique environment and lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **1 distinct type**\n\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is chemically unique.\n    *   **1 distinct type**\n\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic.

Thus, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **two distinct types**.\n    *   **2 distinct types**\n\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons form another **two distinct types**, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their different distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n    *   **2 distinct types**\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning provided by the candidate agents and identifying the key chemical principles required to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nFirst, it is essential to correctly identify the structure of the final product by analyzing the four-step chemical synthesis.

The core of the question is the structural analysis of this molecule.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis requires consideration of the following crucial points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** A five-membered ring like cyclopentane is not static; it is highly flexible and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as pseudorotation) at room temperature. An NMR experiment, which occurs on a slower timescale, observes a time-averaged structure, which is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformation. Analyzing a static structure is a common error that would lead to an incorrect count (often 10, assuming a completely asymmetric frozen structure).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Time-Averaged Symmetry.** The crucial consequence of rapid conformational averaging is that the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry**. This plane bisects the molecule, passing through the aldehyde group (the H-C=O atoms), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and the midpoint of the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** The presence of a substituent (the aldehyde group) at C1 makes the two geminal hydrogens (hydrogens on the same carbon) of any methylene (CH₂) group in the ring chemically distinct from each other. Such protons are called **diastereotopic**. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n#### **Systematic Counting Based on Analysis**\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 type)**\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 type)**\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to symmetry, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from the four protons on these two carbons.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen, which are different from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different electronic environment.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 methine H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the crucial points required to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (Product 4)**\n\nThe first and most fundamental task is to correctly identify the structure of the final product by following the four-step synthesis. There is a strong and correct consensus among all the candidate answers on this chemical pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This reaction is an alpha-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom. The major product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2.** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone, when treated with a strong base, undergoes a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, ultimately forming a carboxylic acid after workup. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that is highly selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The final product (Product 4) is unambiguously **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe central task of the problem is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and dynamic behavior.\n\nHere are the critical points to consider, as highlighted by the provided answers:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not a rigid, flat, or static structure. At room temperature, it undergoes very rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). An NMR spectrometer operates on a slower timescale and observes a single *time-averaged* structure, which is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformation. Analyzing a static structure is a common error that would lead to an incorrect count.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Time-Averaged Symmetry.** The crucial consequence of this rapid conformational averaging is that the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry** on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen atom on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** Due to the presence of the substituent at C1, the two geminal hydrogens on any single methylene (–CH₂–) group in the ring are **diastereotopic**. This means they are in chemically distinct environments because they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the chiral molecule. For example, the two hydrogens on C2 are non-equivalent to each other.\n\n### **Part 3: Systematic Count and Conclusion**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a completely unique chemical environment. **(1 distinct type)**\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This single hydrogen, on the ring carbon bearing the aldehyde, also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 distinct type)**\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its counterpart on C5, and the second proton on C2 to its partner on C5. Thus, the four hydrogens on these two carbons split into **2 distinct types**.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, C3 and C4 are equivalent carbons, but the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. These four protons form another **2 distinct types**, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their different distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n\n**Total Count:** Summing the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe rigorous chemical analysis consistently shows there are **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Matching this number to the options provided:\n\nA) 6\nB) 10\nC) 7\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating a comprehensive review of the provided answers and identifying the crucial chemical principles required to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first task is to trace the chemical transformations through the four-step synthesis to identify the final product. There is a strong and chemically sound consensus among all candidate answers regarding this reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This is an **α-bromination** of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    *   These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available α'-proton, when treated with a strong base, undergoes a ring contraction.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.** (After neutralization, which is implied).\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is the standard, high-yield method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive **acid chloride** using thionyl chloride (SOCl₂).\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   This is a **selective reduction**. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, LiAlH(OtBu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce a reactive acid chloride to an **aldehyde**, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The final product, Product 4, is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The core of the problem now shifts to the structural analysis of this molecule.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis requires careful consideration of several key concepts in stereochemistry and spectroscopy.\n\n#### **Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** A common pitfall is to analyze a single, static \"frozen\" conformation of the molecule. The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not rigid; it undergoes very rapid conformational changes at room temperature (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). Since NMR is a time-averaging technique, the spectrum reflects a more symmetrical time-averaged structure, not any single instantaneous conformer.\n\n2.  **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** The consequence of this rapid conformational averaging is that the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry** on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of a substituent at C1 makes the two hydrogens on any single methylene group (`-CH₂-`) in the ring chemically non-equivalent. These geminal protons are said to be **diastereotopic**. They are in different chemical environments relative to the substituent group and will give rise to different NMR signals if not made equivalent by another symmetry operation.\n\n### **Part 3: Systematic Count and Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\n\n*   **Type 1: The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: This single proton is in a unique chemical environment and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 distinct type)**\n*   **Type 2: The Methine Proton (on C1)**: The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 distinct type)**\n*   **Types 3 & 4: The Protons on C2 and C5**: The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (non-equivalent to each other). The symmetry plane makes the \"upper\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from these four total protons.\n*   **Types 5 & 6: The Protons on C3 and C4**: By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen (which are in a different chemical environment than the C2/C5 protons due to their distance from the aldehyde group).\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided candidate answers and adding clarification to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product's Structure (Product 4)**\n\nThe first essential task is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step chemical synthesis. All candidate answers are in complete and correct agreement on this reaction pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2.** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring becomes a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (after an implied workup step). The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard laboratory method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride using thionyl chloride. The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This reagent, often abbreviated LiAlH(OtBu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It selectively reduces the highly reactive acid chloride to an aldehyde while preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The final product, Product 4, is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis requires consideration of the following crucial points:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** A common error in analyzing flexible rings is to consider only a single, static conformation. The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not rigid and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\") at room temperature. Since this motion is much faster than the NMR timescale, the spectrum reflects a single, **time-averaged** structure which is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Plane of Symmetry.** This time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** Even on carbons that are related by symmetry, we must consider the protons attached to them. The presence of the aldehyde substituent on C1 renders the two hydrogens on any single methylene (CH₂) group in the ring chemically non-equivalent. They are said to be **diastereotopic**, meaning they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule and are thus in different chemical environments.\n\n### **Part 3: Systematic Counting and Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique environment. **(1st type)**\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is in its own unique environment. **(2nd type)**\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its partner on C5, and the other proton on C2 to its partner on C5. Therefore, the four hydrogens on these two carbons split into **two distinct types**. **(3rd and 4th types)**\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four hydrogens form another **two distinct types** (which are different from the protons on C2/C5 due to their different distance from the aldehyde group). **(5th and 6th types)**\n\n**Total Count:** Summing the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe molecule has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the structure of the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence.

This means that even though they are bonded to the same carbon, they are in chemically different environments relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n**Systematic Counting Based on Symmetry and Diastereotopicity:**\n\nBy applying these principles, we can systematically count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n\n*   **Type 1:** The single aldehyde proton (-CHO). It is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (**1 type**)\n*   **Type 2:** The single methine proton on C1 (the ring carbon bearing the aldehyde group). It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (**1 type**)\n*   **Types 3 & 4:** The four protons on C2 and C5. The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry relates one proton on C2 to its partner on C5, and the second proton on C2 to its partner on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from these four total protons.\n*   **Types 5 & 6:** The four protons on C3 and C4. By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent, and the protons on them are diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types**, which are in a different environment from the C2/C5 protons due to their distance from the aldehyde group.\n\n**Final Tally:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate answers and clarifying the key chemical principles to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the structure of the final product by tracing the four-step synthesis. All candidate answers are in unanimous and correct agreement on this chemical pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This reaction is an alpha-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2.** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring rearranges and contracts to form a five-membered cyclopentane ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂/pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride using thionyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This is a selective reduction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce an acid chloride to an aldehyde while preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Conclusion of Part 1:** The final product, Product 4, is unambiguously **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and dynamic behavior.\n\n#### **Careful Points of Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** A common mistake would be to analyze a single, static conformation of the molecule. The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not rigid and undergoes very rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\") at room temperature. Since this movement is much faster than the NMR measurement timescale, the NMR spectrometer observes a single **time-averaged structure** which is more symmetrical than any individual frozen conformer.\n2.  **Plane of Symmetry:** This time-averaged structure possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (the H-C=O atoms), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of a substituent at C1 makes the two hydrogens on any single methylene (`-CH₂-`) group in the ring **diastereotopic**. This means that they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are therefore chemically non-equivalent to each other.\n\n#### **Systematic Counting of Distinct Hydrogens:**\n\nBy combining the principles of symmetry and diastereotopicity, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n*   **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique chemical environment. **(1 type)**\n*   **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon that bears the aldehyde group also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 type)**\n*   **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to the symmetry plane, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its corresponding partner on C5, and the second proton on C2 is equivalent to its partner on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from these four total protons.\n*   **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent due to symmetry. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen, which are different from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different distance from the aldehyde group.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1 methine) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThe correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. This corresponds to option B in the provided question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the crucial points required for a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first task is to trace the chemical transformations through the four-step synthesis to identify the final product. There is a unanimous and chemically sound consensus among all candidate answers on this reaction pathway, which consists of well-established organic transformations.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This is the **α-bromination** of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    *   These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction of this α-halo ketone with a strong base results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   The product, after neutralization, is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is the standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to a more reactive **acid chloride** using thionyl chloride.\n    *   The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   This is a **selective reduction**. The reagent, LiAlH(OtBu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent that is specific for the reduction of an acid chloride to an **aldehyde**, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The final product, Product 4, is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The central question is the structural analysis of this molecule.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum. A rigorous analysis requires considering the following careful points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** A common mistake would be to analyze a single, \"frozen\" conformation of the cyclopentane ring. At room temperature, the ring is flexible and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as pseudorotation). Since this process is much faster than the NMR timescale, the spectrum reflects a single, **time-averaged** structure which is more symmetrical than any single conformer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry.** As a result of this rapid conformational averaging, the molecule possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (the H, C, and O atoms), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** Even with the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens on any single methylene (`-CH₂-`) group in the ring are **not** chemically equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule (which has a substituent at C1). Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2 are different from each other, as are the two on C3, and so on.\n\n### **Systematic Counting**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** It is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 type)**\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This is the single hydrogen on the ring carbon bearing the aldehyde. It is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 type)**\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to the symmetry plane, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its partner on C5, and the second proton on C2 is equivalent to its partner on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from the four total protons on these two carbons.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, C3 and C4 are equivalent positions. The protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen (which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their different distance from the aldehyde group).\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1 methine) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThe correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

At room temperature, it undergoes very rapid conformational changes known as \"pseudorotation\". Since an NMR experiment is a time-averaging technique operating on a slower timescale, it observes a single, averaged structure which is more symmetrical than any individual \"frozen\" conformation. An analysis of a static structure would be a common error, leading to an incorrect count (potentially 10 non-equivalent protons).\n\n2.  **Plane of Symmetry:** This time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**.

However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes one proton on C2 equivalent to its partner on C5, and the second proton on C2 equivalent to its partner on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from the four total protons on these two carbons. **(3rd and 4th types)**\n*   **Types 5 & 6: The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.

This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. This analysis requires careful consideration of the following points:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not a rigid, flat structure. At room temperature, it undergoes very rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). Because NMR spectroscopy is a time-averaging technique on a slower timescale, it does not see a single \"frozen\" conformation. Instead, it observes a time-averaged structure which possesses higher symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry.** This time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** Even on carbons made equivalent by symmetry (e.g., C2 and C5), the two hydrogens on a single methylene (CH₂) group are **not** equivalent to each other.

However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 to its partner on C5. Therefore, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **two distinct types**.\n    *   **Count: 2 types**\n\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons form another **two distinct types**.

This requires analyzing the four-step chemical synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is an α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2.** These conditions are characteristic of a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves an α-halo ketone reacting with a strong base, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted to a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a chlorine atom, yielding **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This reagent is a mild and sterically bulky reducing agent. It is specifically used to selectively reduce an acid chloride to an aldehyde while preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.

Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the question is to analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde and count its number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments. This is equivalent to predicting the number of signals in its proton NMR spectrum. A careful analysis requires considering molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** Cyclopentane rings are not rigid or flat. At room temperature, they undergo rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). An NMR spectrometer operates on a slower timescale and therefore observes a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation. An analysis based on a single \"frozen\" structure would be incorrect.\n*   **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** Due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry** on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (the H, C, and O atoms), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of the aldehyde substituent on C1 means that the two hydrogens on any single methylene (`-CH₂-`) group in the ring are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically distinct from each other because they occupy non-equivalent positions relative to the rest of the chiral molecule.\n\n**Systematic Counting of Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n\nBy combining the principles of symmetry and diastereotopicity, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen types:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a completely unique chemical environment. (**1 type**)\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This is the single hydrogen on the ring carbon that is attached to the aldehyde group. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (**1 type**)\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (distinct). The plane of symmetry relates one proton on C2 to its counterpart on C5, and the *other* proton on C2 to *its* counterpart on C5. Thus, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **2 distinct types**.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types**, which are different from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different distance from the aldehyde group.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1 methine) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Based on the options provided:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 6\nD) 7\n\nThe correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first task is to identify the structure of the final product by correctly interpreting the four-step reaction sequence. This pathway consists of well-established organic reactions.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base leads to a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, forming **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** after an acidic workup (which is implied).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride using thionyl chloride. The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered hydride source that is selective for the reduction of a highly reactive acid chloride to an aldehyde, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Conclusion of Part 1:** The final product is unambiguously **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum under normal conditions. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's structure, symmetry, and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** It is a common mistake to analyze a single, static conformation of the cyclopentane ring. At room temperature, the five-membered ring is highly flexible and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as pseudorotation). An NMR experiment is time-averaged and observes a single structure that reflects the average of all these conformations.\n2.  **Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry:** This rapid conformational averaging results in the molecule possessing an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of a substituent on C1 means that the two hydrogens on any other single methylene (CH₂) group in the ring are chemically non-equivalent to each other. They have a different spatial relationship with the rest of the chiral molecule and are therefore called **diastereotopic**.\n\n### **Systematic Count Based on Analysis:**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n*   **Type 1:** The single aldehyde proton (-CHO). It lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique environment. **(1 type)**\n*   **Type 2:** The single methine proton on C1 (the ring carbon bearing the aldehyde). It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 type)**\n*   **Types 3 & 4:** The four protons on C2 and C5. The symmetry plane makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its partner on C5, and the second proton on C2 to its partner on C5. Thus, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **2 distinct types**.\n*   **Types 5 & 6:** The four protons on C3 and C4. The same logic applies. C3 and C4 are equivalent positions, but the protons on each are diastereotopic. These four protons form another **2 distinct types** (which are different from the protons on C2/C5 due to their different distance from the aldehyde group).\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe molecule has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first task is to correctly identify the structure of the final product by analyzing the four-step synthesis. This pathway consists of well-established organic reactions.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**: This is an **α-bromination of a ketone**. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**: These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring rearranges into a five-membered ring. After workup, a carboxylic acid is formed.\n    *   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**: This is the standard laboratory method for converting a carboxylic acid to an **acid chloride** using thionyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**: This is a **selective reduction**. The reagent is a mild, sterically hindered hydride source that specifically reduces a reactive acid chloride to an **aldehyde** without causing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Conclusion of Part 1:** The final product is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe core of the question is to count the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and dynamic properties.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging**: The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not a rigid, flat structure. At room temperature, it undergoes very rapid conformational changes, a process known as \"pseudorotation.\" Since this process is much faster than the NMR measurement timescale, the spectrum reflects a single *time-averaged* structure. This averaged structure is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformation.\n\n2.  **Time-Averaged Plane of Symmetry**: The time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n3.  **Diastereotopicity**: The presence of the aldehyde substituent on the ring means the two hydrogens on any single methylene (`-CH₂-`) group are **diastereotopic**. This means they are in chemically different environments because they have different spatial relationships to the substituent. For example, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other.\n\n**Systematic Counting of Distinct Hydrogens:**\n\nWe combine the principles of time-averaged symmetry and diastereotopicity to count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique environment and lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **1 distinct type**\n\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** This single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is chemically unique.\n    *   **1 distinct type**\n\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to the symmetry, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to its respective counterpart on C5. Thus, the four total protons on these two carbons split into **two distinct types**.\n    *   **2 distinct types**\n\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons form another **two distinct types**, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their different distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n    *   **2 distinct types**\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning provided by the candidate agents and identifying the key chemical principles required to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nFirst, it is essential to correctly identify the structure of the final product by analyzing the four-step chemical synthesis. There is a unanimous and chemically sound consensus among all the provided answers regarding this reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is an **α-bromination of a ketone**. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone, when treated with a strong base, undergoes a skeletal rearrangement that results in a **ring contraction**.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive **acid chloride**.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   This is a **selective reduction**. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent that specifically reduces an acid chloride to an **aldehyde**, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Conclusion of Part 1**: The final product is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The core of the question is the structural analysis of this molecule.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis requires consideration of the following crucial points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** A five-membered ring like cyclopentane is not static; it is highly flexible and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as pseudorotation) at room temperature. An NMR experiment, which occurs on a slower timescale, observes a time-averaged structure, which is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformation. Analyzing a static structure is a common error that would lead to an incorrect count (often 10, assuming a completely asymmetric frozen structure).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Time-Averaged Symmetry.** The crucial consequence of rapid conformational averaging is that the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry**. This plane bisects the molecule, passing through the aldehyde group (the H-C=O atoms), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and the midpoint of the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** The presence of a substituent (the aldehyde group) at C1 makes the two geminal hydrogens (hydrogens on the same carbon) of any methylene (CH₂) group in the ring chemically distinct from each other. Such protons are called **diastereotopic**. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n#### **Systematic Counting Based on Analysis**\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 type)**\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 type)**\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to symmetry, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from the four protons on these two carbons.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen, which are different from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different electronic environment.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 methine H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the crucial points required to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (Product 4)**\n\nThe first and most fundamental task is to correctly identify the structure of the final product by following the four-step synthesis. There is a strong and correct consensus among all the candidate answers on this chemical pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This reaction is an alpha-bromination of a ketone.

The major product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2.** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone, when treated with a strong base, undergoes a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, ultimately forming a carboxylic acid after workup. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that is highly selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.

This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis requires careful consideration of several key concepts in stereochemistry and spectroscopy.\n\n#### **Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** A common pitfall is to analyze a single, static \"frozen\" conformation of the molecule. The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not rigid; it undergoes very rapid conformational changes at room temperature (a process known as \"pseudorotation\"). Since NMR is a time-averaging technique, the spectrum reflects a more symmetrical time-averaged structure, not any single instantaneous conformer.\n\n2.  **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** The consequence of this rapid conformational averaging is that the molecule effectively possesses a **plane of symmetry** on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of a substituent at C1 makes the two hydrogens on any single methylene group (`-CH₂-`) in the ring chemically non-equivalent. These geminal protons are said to be **diastereotopic**. They are in different chemical environments relative to the substituent group and will give rise to different NMR signals if not made equivalent by another symmetry operation.\n\n### **Part 3: Systematic Count and Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\n\n*   **Type 1: The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: This single proton is in a unique chemical environment and lies on the plane of symmetry. **(1 distinct type)**\n*   **Type 2: The Methine Proton (on C1)**: The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. **(1 distinct type)**\n*   **Types 3 & 4: The Protons on C2 and C5**: The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (non-equivalent to each other). The symmetry plane makes the \"upper\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5.

All candidate answers are in complete and correct agreement on this reaction pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Product 2.** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring becomes a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (after an implied workup step). The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3.** This is a standard laboratory method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride using thionyl chloride. The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4.** This reagent, often abbreviated LiAlH(OtBu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent.

The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The final product, Product 4, is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of unique signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis requires consideration of the following crucial points:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Averaging.** A common error in analyzing flexible rings is to consider only a single, static conformation. The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not rigid and undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as \"pseudorotation\") at room temperature. Since this motion is much faster than the NMR timescale, the spectrum reflects a single, **time-averaged** structure which is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Plane of Symmetry.** This time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Diastereotopicity.** Even on carbons that are related by symmetry, we must consider the protons attached to them. The presence of the aldehyde substituent on C1 renders the two hydrogens on any single methylene (CH₂) group in the ring chemically non-equivalent. They are said to be **diastereotopic**, meaning they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule and are thus in different chemical environments.\n\n### **Part 3: Systematic Counting and Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique environment. **(1st type)**\n2.  **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is in its own unique environment. **(2nd type)**\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane relates one proton on C2 to its partner on C5, and the other proton on C2 to its partner on C5.

The candidate answers show a unanimous and correct consensus on this chemical pathway.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This is an **α-bromination of a ketone**. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    *   These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.

The reagent, LiAlH(OtBu)₃, is a mild and sterically bulky hydride donor that selectively reduces a reactive acid chloride to an **aldehyde**, stopping at that stage without over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Conclusion of Part 1:** The final product is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals in its proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum. A correct analysis must account for the molecule's symmetry and dynamic behavior.\n\n#### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Conformational Averaging:** The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not rigid or flat. At room temperature, it undergoes rapid conformational changes (a process known as pseudorotation). An NMR experiment observes a single time-averaged structure, which is more symmetrical than any single \"frozen\" conformation. Analyzing a static structure is a common mistake that would incorrectly suggest all 10 ring hydrogens are different (leading to option C).\n2.  **Time-Averaged Symmetry:** The time-averaged structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Diastereotopicity:** The presence of the substituent at C1 makes the two hydrogens on each methylene (–CH₂–) group in the ring chemically non-equivalent. They are **diastereotopic**, meaning they exist in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n#### **Systematic Count**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n*   **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment and lies on the plane of symmetry. (**1 distinct type**)\n*   **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde also lies on the plane of symmetry and is in its own unique environment. (**1 distinct type**)\n*   **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to the symmetry plane, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to its respective partner on C5. Thus, the four hydrogens on these two carbons split into **2 distinct types**.\n*   **Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent, and the protons on them are diastereotopic. These four protons result in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen (which are in a different chemical environment from the C2/C5 protons).\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe correct number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 7\nB) 6\nC) 10\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step chemical synthesis.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is the **α-bromination of a ketone**. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    *   These conditions are classic for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base leads to a **ring contraction**.\n    *   The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring. After workup, a carboxylic acid is obtained.\n    *   Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3**\n    *   This is the standard laboratory procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an **acid chloride**. The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n    *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   This is a **selective reduction**. The reagent, LiAlH(O*t*Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered hydride donor. It is highly specific for reducing a reactive acid chloride to an **aldehyde**, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. This conclusion is sound and unanimously supported by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

This means they are chemically distinct from each other because they occupy non-equivalent positions relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n**Systematic Count based on Symmetry and Diastereotopicity:**\n\nBy applying these principles, we can systematically count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n*   **Type 1:** The single **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). It is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (**1 distinct type**)\n*   **Type 2:** The single **methine proton** (on C1, the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde). It is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (**1 distinct type**)\n*   **Types 3 & 4:** The four protons on carbons C2 and C5. The plane of symmetry makes these two carbon positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to the symmetry plane, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its partner on C5, and the second proton on C2 is equivalent to its partner on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from these four total protons.\n*   **Types 5 & 6:** The four protons on carbons C3 and C4. The same logic applies: C3 and C4 are equivalent positions, but the protons on each are diastereotopic. These four protons also form **2 distinct types**, which are different from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different electronic environment (distance from the aldehyde).\n\n**Final Tally:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step synthesis.

Due to symmetry, one proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to its respective counterpart on C5. This results in **2 distinct types** of hydrogen from the four total protons on these two carbons.\n*   **The Protons on C3 and C4:** By the same logic, C3 and C4 are equivalent positions. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four protons give another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen, which are in a different chemical environment from the protons at the C2/C5 positions due to their different distance from the aldehyde group.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.
