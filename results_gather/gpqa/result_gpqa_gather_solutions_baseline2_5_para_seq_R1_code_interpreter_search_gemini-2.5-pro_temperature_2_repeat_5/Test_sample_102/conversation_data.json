Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  `-COCH₃` (acetyl group) at position 1.\n    2.  `-Br` (bromo group) at position 3.\n    3.  `-NO₂` (nitro group) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-arrangement. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Review Key Chemical Principles**\n\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):** The order of adding groups is critical.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** `-COCH₃` (acetyl) and `-NO₂` (nitro) are deactivating and direct incoming groups to the meta position.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors:** `-Br` (bromo) is deactivating but directs incoming groups to the ortho and para positions. `-NH₂` (amino) is strongly activating and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Limitations of Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, has critical failures:\n    1.  It does **not** work on strongly deactivated rings, such as a ring containing a `-NO₂` group.\n    2.  It does **not** work on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and poisons it.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Verdict: Fails.** The ring is strongly deactivated by the `-NO₂` group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n    *   **Verdict: Fails.** The basic `-NH₂` group of aniline reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, making this reaction non-viable as written.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene.\n    *   **Verdict: Fails.** This is a pointless reaction loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   This sequence describes a complex but viable and well-known synthetic strategy.\n    *   **i) & ii):** Acylation of benzene gives acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position. This is efficient.\n    *   **iii):** The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict, producing a mixture of isomers.\n    *   **iv) - vii):** This is the elegant solution to the problem created in step (iii). The entire mixture is taken forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (`-NH₂`), which acts as a powerful temporary director. A second nitration is performed. In this crucial step, the directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group work cooperatively to place the new nitro group in the C5 position with high selectivity. This \"converges\" the mixture toward the correct product structure. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.** This is the only sequence that contains no non-viable reactions. It employs an advanced \"convergent\" strategy to overcome a non-selective step, which is characteristic of a high-yield synthesis for a complex molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal:**\n    *   **Target Product:** The molecule to be synthesized is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** The pattern is 1,3,5. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means the pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, maximizing the formation of the desired product over isomers and avoiding reactions with low conversion rates.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Key Chemical Principles and Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects:** The order of the reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n        *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl) and `-NO₂` (Nitro) are deactivating and **meta-directors**.\n        *   `-Br` (Bromo) is deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (Amino), which can be formed as an intermediate, is strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Limitation:** This crucial reaction, used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`), has major limitations. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those containing a `-NO₂` group) and also on aniline (rings with a basic `-NH₂` group), which reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Option from the Question:**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. These first two steps are selective and efficient.\n        *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), so this step produces a mixture of isomers. This appears non-selective.\n        *   **Step iv & v:** This is the core of the brilliant strategy. The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to a mixture of amino isomers. A *second* nitration is then performed. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group (`-NH₂`, ortho,para) and the acetyl group (`-COCH₃`, meta) **work cooperatively** to direct the new nitro group to the C5 position. This highly selective step causes the different reaction pathways to **converge** on the correct precursor.\n        *   **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a chemically sound, albeit complex, \"convergent synthesis\". It is designed to overcome the non-selective step to provide a high overall yield. **This option is correct.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline.\n        *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with and poisons the `AlCl₃` catalyst. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        *   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless reaction loop that accomplishes nothing. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to p-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n        *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing acylation. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, Options B, C, and D contain steps that are either fundamentally flawed or nonsensical. Option A is the only choice that outlines a valid and sophisticated synthetic pathway. It employs a well-known convergent synthesis strategy that, despite an intermediate non-selective step, is designed as a whole to be a high-yield process by resolving the isomeric mixture in a later, highly selective step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, beginning with benzene.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-relationship, meaning all three substituents are *meta* to one another.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which necessitates an efficient and highly regioselective pathway.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\nTo design the synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain reactions.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-NH₂` (Amino, as an intermediate): Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) Limitations:** This essential reaction (adding the acetyl group) is highly sensitive and **FAILS** under two conditions relevant here:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings, such as one containing a nitro group.\n    2.  On aniline (a ring with an amino group), as the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### **3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each pathway based on its chemical validity.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It fails at step (iii). After creating aniline in the first two steps, the Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted. As established, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It fails at step (iii). After creating bromonitrobenzene in the first two steps, a Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is complex but chemically sound, representing a classic example of an elegant \"convergent synthesis.\"\n    1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene yields **acetophenone**. This correctly installs a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group selectively directs the bromine to C3, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step nitratres 3-bromoacetophenone. Because the existing directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), this produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group, which is a powerful temporary directing group. No product is discarded.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, high-yield step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) and the other substituents **work together to direct the *new* nitro group to the same position (C5)**. This highly selective step resolves the previous mixture, \"funneling\" all the material toward the correctly substituted intermediate.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`) and reduction (`H₃PO₂`) to give the final target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they contain either nonsensical loops or chemically non-viable reactions. Option B is the only pathway that is chemically sound from start to finish. It cleverly overcomes the problem of conflicting directors by using a temporary directing group and a convergent step, which is a known strategy for achieving a high overall yield in a complex synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal.**\n    *   **Target Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n    *   **Structure Breakdown:** The benzene ring has three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Key Structural Feature:** All three substituents are *meta* to each other in a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis, which demands that the reaction steps are chemically viable and provide good regioselectivity (i.e., they produce the desired isomer in high proportion).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects and Critical Reaction Constraints.**\n    *   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):** The order of reactions is dictated by how each substituent influences where the next one goes.\n        *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, but an **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (Amino, used as a temporary intermediate): Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **Key Reaction Failures (Constraints):**\n        *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) will **fail** or give very poor yield on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group), because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the `AlCl₃` Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Proposed Synthetic Route (from the original question).**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) HNO₃... iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂...**\n        *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply convert benzene back into benzene. This is a futile and nonsensical reaction loop. **This route is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   Steps i and ii produce bromonitrobenzene. Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents Friedel-Crafts acylation. **This route is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   Steps i and ii convert benzene into aniline. Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n        *   This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. **This route is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   This sequence is long but represents a valid, sophisticated strategy. Let's trace it:\n        1.  **Step i → ii:** First, acylation of benzene gives acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so the subsequent bromination correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. These first two steps are selective and effective.\n        2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step is not selective. In 3-bromoacetophenone, the directors are in conflict (acetyl is meta, bromo is ortho,para). This produces a *mixture* of nitro isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  **Step iv → vii (The Convergent Strategy):** This is the brilliant part that makes the synthesis high-yield overall.\n            *   The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to a mixture of amino isomers (step iv).\n            *   This mixture is then nitrated *again* (step v). Crucially, under the strong acid conditions (`H₂SO₄`), the amino groups are protonated to anilinium ions (`-NH₃⁺`), which are deactivating *meta*-directors.\n            *   Let's analyze the directing effects for the two main isomers. In both `3-bromo-4-ammonioacetophenone` and `3-bromo-6-ammonioacetophenone`, the `-Br` group and `-COCH₃` group cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**.\n            *   This means both paths **converge** on a precursor with the correct 3-bromo-5-nitro substitution pattern, just with a temporary amino group still attached elsewhere.\n            *   Finally, this temporary amino group is cleanly removed by diazotization and deamination (steps vi and vii) to give the target product.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of a convergent synthesis. It cleverly resolves an unselective step by funneling the resulting mixture into a single product stream, making the overall synthesis high-yield. **This route is correct.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBy eliminating the options that contain chemically invalid steps, only one viable route remains. Options A, B, and C are incorrect due to a nonsensical loop or failed Friedel-Crafts reactions. Option D describes a sophisticated but sound convergent synthesis that leads to the target product in high overall yield.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (`-Br`)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (`-NO₂`)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The 1,3,5 arrangement means all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies a chemically sound and regioselective pathway.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on how each group directs subsequent substitutions.\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (Amino):** Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**. (This group is used as a temporary intermediate in some options).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Key Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is very important but has strict limitations. It **fails** on:\n    1.  **Strongly deactivated rings**, such as those containing a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  **Aniline rings**, as the basic amino group (`-NH₂`) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and poisons it.\n\n### **4. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the chemical principles above. Note that all 15 provided candidate answers, despite labeling the options differently, unanimously identify the same chemical sequence as correct and all other sequences as flawed.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that does not produce the desired product. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence creates bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails at step (iii). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence creates aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails at step (iii). The basic amino group of aniline poisons the `AlCl₃` catalyst. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This option describes a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step \"convergent synthesis\".\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** First, an acetyl group is added to benzene to form acetophenone. The *meta-directing* acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position. This creates **3-bromoacetophenone** selectively.\n        2.  **Step iii:** A nitro group is added. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict, producing a mixture of isomers.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`), which is a powerful director.\n        4.  **Step v:** A second nitration is performed. This is the crucial, elegant step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This is a highly selective step that funnels, or \"converges,\" the mixture toward the correct product precursor.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a well-established and elegant synthetic route designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly resolving an isomeric mixture. **Correct.**\n\nAll 15 provided candidate answers agree on this analysis. They all conclude that the only viable sequence is the one described in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule**: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material**: Benzene.\n*   **Structure Analysis**: The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (`-COCH₃`) at position 1. This is a deactivating and **meta-director**.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (`-Br`) at position 3. This is a deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (`-NO₂`) at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Feature**: The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Requirement**: The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, meaning the chosen pathway must be chemically sound and strategically designed for high regioselectivity.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Fundamental Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA)**: The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations that are central to this problem:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group, `-NH₂`), because the basic amine acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`), \"poisoning\" it and deactivating the ring.\n*   **Temporary Directing Groups**: The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) in the options is a strong indication that an advanced strategy is required. This strategy involves creating a temporary amino group to control the position of other substituents before being removed.\n\n### **3. Systematically Analyze Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option from the question based on these principles.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: Steps (i) and (ii) form p-bromonitrobenzene (as the major product). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a nonsensical loop that does not advance the synthesis. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence describes a complex but chemically sound and well-established strategy.\n        1.  **Step i & ii**: Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, efficiently forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the crucial 1,3 pattern.\n        2.  **Step iii**: Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because of conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, while `-Br` is ortho,para), producing a mixture of isomers. This appears to be a low-yield step, but it is part of a larger plan.\n        3.  **Step iv**: The entire mixture of nitro-isomers is reduced to the corresponding mixture of amino-isomers, introducing a powerful temporary directing group.\n        4.  **Step v**: This is the brilliant, regioselective step. The mixture is nitrated a second time. This process is designed so that the desired final substitution pattern is achieved with high selectivity from the mixture of intermediates.\n        5.  **Step vi & vii**: The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This pathway, known as a convergent synthesis, is the only one that is chemically viable. It is cleverly designed to overcome the problem of conflicting directors by using a temporary directing group, thereby allowing for a high overall yield of the final complex product.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D are all invalidated by fundamental reaction failures or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that represents a complete, plausible, and elegant synthetic strategy to achieve the target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Goal\n\n*   **Target Molecule**: The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure**: A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement**: The synthesis must be \"high-yield\", meaning the reaction sequence must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of unwanted isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Key Chemical Principles and Constraints\n\n*   **Substituent Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical and is governed by the directing effects of each group in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NH₂` (Amino): Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**. (This group appears as an intermediate).\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations**: This is a crucial reaction for adding the acetyl group, but it has two severe limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (rings with an amino group, `-NH₂`) because the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option from the original question based on these principles.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence creates bromonitrobenzene (mainly the para-isomer) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This fails at step (iii). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: The first four steps—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence first prepares aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This fails at step (iii). The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating both the catalyst and the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n        1.  **(i) & (ii)**: First, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the meta-directing acetyl group. Subsequent bromination correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone efficiently.\n        2.  **(iii)**: Nitration of this molecule gives a **mixture of isomers** because of conflicting directing effects from the acetyl (meta) and bromo (ortho,para) groups.\n        3.  **(iv)**: The nitro groups on the entire mixture are reduced to amino groups, creating a powerful, temporary directing group.\n        4.  **(v)**: This is the brilliant, high-yield step. A second nitration is performed. For the main isomers in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step funnels the product mixture toward the desired structure.\n        5.  **(vi) & (vii)**: The temporary amino group, having served its strategic purpose, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is the only sequence that uses chemically viable steps throughout and employs a valid, elegant strategy to achieve a high overall yield for a challenging target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Goal and the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure Breakdown:** The target is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5 arrangement, meaning each substituent is *meta* to the other two.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which implies the reaction sequence must be chemically viable and designed for high selectivity.\n\n### **2. Establish Core Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\nTo correctly order the reactions, we must consider the directing effects of each group in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain key reactions.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl (`-COCH₃`)**: Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Nitro (`-NO₂`)**: Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo (`-Br`)**: Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **Amino (`-NH₂`)**: (Appears as an intermediate) Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) Limitations:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, is essential but sensitive. It fails under two conditions relevant here:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro (`-NO₂`) group.\n    2.  On aniline (rings with an amino (`-NH₂`) group), as the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n\n### **3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe will now analyze each provided sequence for its chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and removal of the diazonium group) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chemically futile loop and does not advance the synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    *   **Analysis:** Step (i) produces bromobenzene, and step (ii) nitrates it, primarily to p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, deactivating both the catalyst and the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence outlines a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step synthesis.\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. These first steps are efficient and selective.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is **not selective** because the directing effects of the acetyl group (*meta*) and the bromo group (*ortho,para*) are in conflict. This results in a mixture of isomers.\n        3.  **Steps iv - vii:** This is the elegant part of the strategy. The mixture of isomers is carried forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group, which is a powerful temporary director. Then, a second nitration is performed. In this crucial step, the directing effects of the powerful amino group and the acetyl group **work cooperatively**, directing the new nitro group to the **C5 position** with high selectivity for the major isomers in the mixture. This is a **convergent** step that funnels the mixture toward the correct product structure. Finally, the temporary amino group, its job done, is cleanly removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only option where all steps are chemically viable. It represents a classic \"convergent synthesis,\" a strategy designed to overcome selectivity problems in complex syntheses, thereby achieving a high overall yield.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain either nonsensical loops or chemically unviable reaction steps. Option B is the only sequence that represents a valid, albeit complex, pathway that successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on the Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce large amounts of unwanted isomers or that fail to proceed.\n\n### **2. Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other fundamental reaction limitations.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is crucial but is subject to strict rules. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n*   **Advanced Strategy Indication:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) in the options strongly suggests the use of a sophisticated strategy involving an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a temporary, powerful directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option provided in the question based on chemical viability and the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. As established, this reaction fails because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   This pathway is complex but represents a chemically sound and elegant solution, known as a convergent synthesis.\n        1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n        2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a selective step.\n        3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a critical step in the strategy. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is **not selective** because the directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` directs meta, while `-Br` directs ortho/para). This produces a mixture of isomers. While this seems to violate the \"high-yield\" rule, it is part of a larger plan.\n        4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group. This introduces a powerful, temporary directing group.\n        5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that redeems the synthesis. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For the major intermediates in the mixture (e.g., 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the powerful directing effects of the new amino group (ortho/para-director) and the original acetyl group (meta-director) **work together (cooperate)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediates into a single product line.\n        6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its crucial role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the target molecule.\n    *   This is the only chemically valid pathway that leads to a high overall yield.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This pathway is nonsensical. The first four steps (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) simply convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. The presence of the nitro group prevents the acylation from occurring. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option B describes a valid \"convergent synthesis\". Although it involves a non-selective intermediate step, the overall strategy is designed to resolve that mixture in a subsequent, highly selective step, leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product. This represents the most sophisticated and chemically correct pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which means the order of reactions must be chosen to maximize regioselectivity and avoid reaction failures.\n*   **Structure Analysis:** The benzene ring has three substituents in a 1,3,5-relationship (all are meta to each other):\n    1.  An **acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)** at position 1. This is a deactivating **meta-director**.\n    2.  A **bromo group (`-Br`)** at position 3. This is a deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n    3.  A **nitro group (`-NO₂`)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (using `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` to add the acetyl group) is critical but has major limitations.\n    *   It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    *   It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and \"poisons\" it, forming an unreactive complex.\n\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduction of `-NO₂` to `-NH₂`), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) in the options indicates a sophisticated strategy is likely needed. This involves using an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a powerful temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Methodically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option provided in the question based on the established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This pathway attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a bromonitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from proceeding. This is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   This sequence takes benzene, converts it to nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a **pointless loop** that makes no progress toward the final product. It simply regenerates the starting material.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it (step iii).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails** under standard conditions. The basic amino group (`-NH₂`) of aniline acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`), poisoning the catalyst and deactivating the ring. This is not a valid synthetic step as written.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound strategy known as a \"convergent synthesis.\"\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This start is efficient and selective.\n    2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step involves nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict (acetyl is *meta*, bromo is *ortho,para*), leading to a **mixture of isomers**.\n    3.  **Steps iv & v (Convergent Steps):** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group (`-NH₂`), creating a powerful temporary directing group. Then, a second nitration is performed. In this key step, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the new nitro group to the **same position (C5)** for the major isomers in the mixture. This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways, funneling the mixture from step iii toward the correct intermediate.\n    4.  **Steps vi & vii (Cleanup):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its critical role in directing the final substitution, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to give the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only option that is chemically sound from start to finish. It uses a well-established and elegant synthetic design to overcome the challenge of a complex substitution pattern, resulting in a high overall yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.

A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5 arrangement. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to one another.\n    *   **Goal:** The task requires finding a \"high-yield\" synthesis from benzene. This implies that the reaction sequence must be chemically valid and highly selective (regioselective) to maximize the desired product.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Key Chemical Principles and Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Substituent Directing Effects:** The success of the synthesis depends on correctly sequencing the reactions based on how substituents direct new groups in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n        *   `-COCH₃` (acetyl) is a deactivating **meta-director**.\n        *   `-Br` (bromo) is a deactivating **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NO₂` (nitro) is a strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (amino, used as a temporary intermediate) is a strongly activating **ortho,para-director**. When protonated in strong acid to `-NH₃⁺`, it becomes a deactivating **meta-director**.\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations:** This reaction is critical for adding the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) but has crucial limitations:\n        *   It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as one containing a nitro group.\n        *   It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the `AlCl₃` Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that does not advance the synthesis. It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) produce bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents Friedel-Crafts acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline (`-NH₂`). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating it and the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step \"convergent synthesis.\"\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group then correctly places bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. These steps are selective and valid.\n        2.  **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step is not highly selective because of conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is *meta*, while -Br is *ortho,para*), which produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n        3.  **Steps iv & v:** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The nitro groups on the isomer mixture are reduced to amino groups (`-NH₂`), which act as powerful temporary directors (step iv). Then, a second nitration is performed (step v). In the strongly acidic nitrating medium, the amino group is protonated to an anilinium ion (`-NH₃⁺`), which is a *meta*-director. This `-NH₃⁺` group and the original `-COCH₃` group now work together to direct the incoming nitro group to the **C5 position**. This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways, funneling the mixture from step iii toward the correct intermediate.\n        4.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino/anilinium group, having fulfilled its strategic purpose, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is the only option that describes a complete and viable chemical pathway. The use of a temporary directing group in a convergent strategy is a classic approach to achieve a high overall yield for a complex target molecule like this one.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on a thorough analysis of chemical principles and reaction constraints, Options B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible steps or nonsensical loops. Option A describes a valid, albeit complex, synthetic route that correctly leads to the target molecule with a high overall yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on the Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three substituents are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This necessitates a highly selective (regioselective) pathway that avoids major reaction failures or the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nThe success of the synthesis depends on strategically navigating the directing effects of substituents and avoiding known reaction failures.\n\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Crucial Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is very sensitive and **fails** under two conditions relevant to this problem:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  On aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Methodically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on its chemical viability and adherence to the principles above.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction is well-known to fail because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Thus, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. The presence of the powerfully deactivating nitro group prevents the acylation from occurring. Thus, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    This pathway is nonsensical. The first four steps (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) simply convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not advance the synthesis toward the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    This pathway is complex but represents a chemically sound, elegant, and ultimately high-yield solution known as a \"convergent synthesis.\"\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation) & ii (Bromination):** Benzene is first converted to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This initial setup is selective and efficient.\n    2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a key strategic step. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is **not selective** because the directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` directs meta to C5, while `-Br` directs ortho/para to C2, C4, C6). This produces a mixture of isomers. While this seems to violate the \"high-yield\" rule, it is part of a larger plan.\n    3.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the entire mixture of isomers is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group. This introduces a powerful, temporary directing group.\n    4.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that redeems the synthesis. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the new amino group (ortho,para) and the original acetyl group (meta) **work together (converge)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediates into a single product line.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its crucial role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only one that describes a valid synthetic strategy. Although it involves a non-selective intermediate step, the overall strategy is designed to resolve that mixture in a subsequent, highly selective step, leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product. This represents the most sophisticated and chemically correct pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, maximizing the formation of the desired product over isomers.\n\n### **2. Review Key Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, is essential but has two critical constraints:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as one with a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with a basic `-NH₂` group), as the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and poisons it.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option from the Prompt**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for its chemical viability and its ability to achieve a high yield.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical and futile loop that makes no progress toward the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring and poisoning the catalyst. Therefore, this pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) produce 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as the major product. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n        1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group then correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is efficient.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para) and produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group, creating a powerful temporary directing group.\n        4.  **Step v:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture is nitrated a second time. For the major isomers, the directing effects of the powerful amino group (ortho,para) and the acetyl group (meta) now **cooperate**, both directing the incoming nitro group to the same position, **C5**. This highly selective step \"funnels\" the mixture toward the correct substitution pattern.\n        5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic, high-yield synthetic strategy for complex targets. It is the only option that is chemically valid and complete.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target:** The product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.

It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n        2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group, `-NH₂`), because the basic amine group reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n    *   **Advanced Strategies:** The reagents `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) strongly indicate a sophisticated synthesis using a temporary directing group, which is introduced to control substitution and later removed.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Based on the Provided Question:**\n    Let's analyze the specific options provided in the question.\n\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence first creates bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This pathway fails. The Friedel-Crafts reaction does not work on the ring once it is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   **Analysis:** This option describes a complex but sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n            *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the meta-directing acetyl group ensures selective bromination at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step iii:** This intermediate is nitrated. Due to conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), this step produces a mixture of isomers. This appears non-selective.\n            *   **Steps iv & v:** This is the crucial, elegant part. The nitro groups on the entire mixture are reduced to amino (`-NH₂`) groups.

Although complex, it represents a known, elegant strategy to achieve a high overall yield for the target molecule. All of the candidate analyses, despite their final letter choices being scrambled, agree on the chemical reasoning that makes this specific sequence the correct one.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, beginning with benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern. All three groups are *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**. This implies that the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant amounts of unwanted isomers or that fail to proceed effectively.\n\n### 2. Analyze Key Chemical Principles and Constraints\nTo devise a successful synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other fundamental reaction limitations.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-NH₂` (Amino): Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**. This group can be used as a powerful temporary directing group.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) Constraints:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, has critical limitations:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n*   **Analysis of Simple Routes:**\n    *   A direct bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone would be very slow due to the presence of two strong deactivating groups.\n    *   A direct nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone would lead to poor selectivity and a mixture of products because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict.\n    *   These issues suggest that a more complex strategy using a temporary directing group is necessary to meet the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option from the Prompt\n\nLet's evaluate each option for its chemical viability.\n\n*   **A) `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**\n    *   **Flaw:** The first four steps (i-iv) take benzene, nitrate it, reduce it, diazotize it, and deaminate it, resulting in the regeneration of the starting material, benzene.

Because of conflicting directors, this produces a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone). This step is part of a larger strategy.\n        4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group, creating a temporary, powerful directing group (e.g., `3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone`).\n        5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the crucial, high-yield step. For the intermediate (`3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone`), the powerful `-NH₂` group (directing to C5, para) and the `-COCH₃` group (directing to C5, meta) now **work cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, C5, with very high selectivity. This \"convergent\" step funnels the product mixture toward the desired precursor: `3-bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone`.\n        6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group at C4, having fulfilled its role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only chemically sound and complete pathway that accounts for the \"high-yield\" requirement by using a sophisticated, multi-step strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position. This establishes the 1,3-relationship selectively.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is intentionally not selective due to conflicting directing effects and produces a mixture of isomers. This is a strategic choice, not a flaw.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to a temporary amino (`-NH₂`) group, which is a powerful director. No product is discarded.\n        4.  **Step v:** A second nitration is performed. This is the crucial, yield-rescuing step. The powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group **work cooperatively**, directing the incoming nitro group to the same position (C5) for the major isomers in the mixture. This highly selective step resolves the previous mixture, \"funneling\" the material towards the desired intermediate.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, its job complete, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to give the final target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only pathway that is chemically viable from start to finish. It uses an advanced strategy to overcome selectivity problems, making it the only option capable of a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  `-COCH₃` (acetyl group) at position 1.\n    2.  `-Br` (bromo group) at position 3.\n    3.  `-NO₂` (nitro group) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-arrangement. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Review Key Chemical Principles**\n\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):** The order of adding groups is critical.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** `-COCH₃` (acetyl) and `-NO₂` (nitro) are deactivating and direct incoming groups to the meta position.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors:** `-Br` (bromo) is deactivating but directs incoming groups to the ortho and para positions. `-NH₂` (amino) is strongly activating and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Limitations of Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, has critical failures:\n    1.  It does **not** work on strongly deactivated rings, such as a ring containing a `-NO₂` group.\n    2.  It does **not** work on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and poisons it.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Verdict: Fails.** The ring is strongly deactivated by the `-NO₂` group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n    *   **Verdict: Fails.** The basic `-NH₂` group of aniline reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, making this reaction non-viable as written.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene.\n    *   **Verdict: Fails.** This is a pointless reaction loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   This sequence describes a complex but viable and well-known synthetic strategy.\n    *   **i) & ii):** Acylation of benzene gives acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position. This is efficient.\n    *   **iii):** The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict, producing a mixture of isomers.\n    *   **iv) - vii):** This is the elegant solution to the problem created in step (iii). The entire mixture is taken forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (`-NH₂`), which acts as a powerful temporary director. A second nitration is performed. In this crucial step, the directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group work cooperatively to place the new nitro group in the C5 position with high selectivity. This \"converges\" the mixture toward the correct product structure. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.** This is the only sequence that contains no non-viable reactions. It employs an advanced \"convergent\" strategy to overcome a non-selective step, which is characteristic of a high-yield synthesis for a complex molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal:**\n    *   **Target Product:** The molecule to be synthesized is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** The pattern is 1,3,5. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means the pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, maximizing the formation of the desired product over isomers and avoiding reactions with low conversion rates.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Key Chemical Principles and Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects:** The order of the reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n        *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl) and `-NO₂` (Nitro) are deactivating and **meta-directors**.\n        *   `-Br` (Bromo) is deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (Amino), which can be formed as an intermediate, is strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Limitation:** This crucial reaction, used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`), has major limitations. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those containing a `-NO₂` group) and also on aniline (rings with a basic `-NH₂` group), which reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Option from the Question:**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. These first two steps are selective and efficient.\n        *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), so this step produces a mixture of isomers. This appears non-selective.\n        *   **Step iv & v:** This is the core of the brilliant strategy. The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to a mixture of amino isomers. A *second* nitration is then performed. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group (`-NH₂`, ortho,para) and the acetyl group (`-COCH₃`, meta) **work cooperatively** to direct the new nitro group to the C5 position. This highly selective step causes the different reaction pathways to **converge** on the correct precursor.\n        *   **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a chemically sound, albeit complex, \"convergent synthesis\". It is designed to overcome the non-selective step to provide a high overall yield. **This option is correct.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline.\n        *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with and poisons the `AlCl₃` catalyst. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        *   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless reaction loop that accomplishes nothing. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to p-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n        *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing acylation. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, Options B, C, and D contain steps that are either fundamentally flawed or nonsensical. Option A is the only choice that outlines a valid and sophisticated synthetic pathway. It employs a well-known convergent synthesis strategy that, despite an intermediate non-selective step, is designed as a whole to be a high-yield process by resolving the isomeric mixture in a later, highly selective step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, beginning with benzene.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-relationship, meaning all three substituents are *meta* to one another.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which necessitates an efficient and highly regioselective pathway.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\nTo design the synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain reactions.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-NH₂` (Amino, as an intermediate): Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) Limitations:** This essential reaction (adding the acetyl group) is highly sensitive and **FAILS** under two conditions relevant here:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings, such as one containing a nitro group.\n    2.  On aniline (a ring with an amino group), as the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### **3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each pathway based on its chemical validity.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It fails at step (iii). After creating aniline in the first two steps, the Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted. As established, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It fails at step (iii). After creating bromonitrobenzene in the first two steps, a Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is complex but chemically sound, representing a classic example of an elegant \"convergent synthesis.\"\n    1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene yields **acetophenone**. This correctly installs a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group selectively directs the bromine to C3, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step nitratres 3-bromoacetophenone. Because the existing directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` is meta, `-Br` is ortho,para), this produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group, which is a powerful temporary directing group. No product is discarded.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, high-yield step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) and the other substituents **work together to direct the *new* nitro group to the same position (C5)**. This highly selective step resolves the previous mixture, \"funneling\" all the material toward the correctly substituted intermediate.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`) and reduction (`H₃PO₂`) to give the final target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they contain either nonsensical loops or chemically non-viable reactions. Option B is the only pathway that is chemically sound from start to finish. It cleverly overcomes the problem of conflicting directors by using a temporary directing group and a convergent step, which is a known strategy for achieving a high overall yield in a complex synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal.**\n    *   **Target Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n    *   **Structure Breakdown:** The benzene ring has three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Key Structural Feature:** All three substituents are *meta* to each other in a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis, which demands that the reaction steps are chemically viable and provide good regioselectivity (i.e., they produce the desired isomer in high proportion).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects and Critical Reaction Constraints.**\n    *   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):** The order of reactions is dictated by how each substituent influences where the next one goes.\n        *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, but an **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (Amino, used as a temporary intermediate): Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **Key Reaction Failures (Constraints):**\n        *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) will **fail** or give very poor yield on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group), because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the `AlCl₃` Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Proposed Synthetic Route (from the original question).**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) HNO₃... iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂...**\n        *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) simply convert benzene back into benzene. This is a futile and nonsensical reaction loop. **This route is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   Steps i and ii produce bromonitrobenzene. Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents Friedel-Crafts acylation. **This route is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   Steps i and ii convert benzene into aniline. Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n        *   This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. **This route is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   This sequence is long but represents a valid, sophisticated strategy. Let's trace it:\n        1.  **Step i → ii:** First, acylation of benzene gives acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so the subsequent bromination correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. These first two steps are selective and effective.\n        2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step is not selective. In 3-bromoacetophenone, the directors are in conflict (acetyl is meta, bromo is ortho,para). This produces a *mixture* of nitro isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  **Step iv → vii (The Convergent Strategy):** This is the brilliant part that makes the synthesis high-yield overall.\n            *   The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to a mixture of amino isomers (step iv).\n            *   This mixture is then nitrated *again* (step v). Crucially, under the strong acid conditions (`H₂SO₄`), the amino groups are protonated to anilinium ions (`-NH₃⁺`), which are deactivating *meta*-directors.\n            *   Let's analyze the directing effects for the two main isomers. In both `3-bromo-4-ammonioacetophenone` and `3-bromo-6-ammonioacetophenone`, the `-Br` group and `-COCH₃` group cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**.\n            *   This means both paths **converge** on a precursor with the correct 3-bromo-5-nitro substitution pattern, just with a temporary amino group still attached elsewhere.\n            *   Finally, this temporary amino group is cleanly removed by diazotization and deamination (steps vi and vii) to give the target product.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of a convergent synthesis. It cleverly resolves an unselective step by funneling the resulting mixture into a single product stream, making the overall synthesis high-yield. **This route is correct.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBy eliminating the options that contain chemically invalid steps, only one viable route remains. Options A, B, and C are incorrect due to a nonsensical loop or failed Friedel-Crafts reactions. Option D describes a sophisticated but sound convergent synthesis that leads to the target product in high overall yield.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (`-Br`)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (`-NO₂`)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The 1,3,5 arrangement means all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies a chemically sound and regioselective pathway.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on how each group directs subsequent substitutions.\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (Amino):** Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**. (This group is used as a temporary intermediate in some options).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Key Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is very important but has strict limitations. It **fails** on:\n    1.  **Strongly deactivated rings**, such as those containing a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  **Aniline rings**, as the basic amino group (`-NH₂`) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and poisons it.\n\n### **4. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the chemical principles above. Note that all 15 provided candidate answers, despite labeling the options differently, unanimously identify the same chemical sequence as correct and all other sequences as flawed.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that does not produce the desired product. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence creates bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails at step (iii). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence creates aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails at step (iii). The basic amino group of aniline poisons the `AlCl₃` catalyst. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This option describes a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step \"convergent synthesis\".\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** First, an acetyl group is added to benzene to form acetophenone. The *meta-directing* acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position. This creates **3-bromoacetophenone** selectively.\n        2.  **Step iii:** A nitro group is added. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict, producing a mixture of isomers.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`), which is a powerful director.\n        4.  **Step v:** A second nitration is performed. This is the crucial, elegant step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This is a highly selective step that funnels, or \"converges,\" the mixture toward the correct product precursor.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a well-established and elegant synthetic route designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly resolving an isomeric mixture. **Correct.**\n\nAll 15 provided candidate answers agree on this analysis. They all conclude that the only viable sequence is the one described in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule**: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material**: Benzene.\n*   **Structure Analysis**: The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (`-COCH₃`) at position 1. This is a deactivating and **meta-director**.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (`-Br`) at position 3. This is a deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (`-NO₂`) at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Feature**: The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Requirement**: The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, meaning the chosen pathway must be chemically sound and strategically designed for high regioselectivity.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Fundamental Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA)**: The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations that are central to this problem:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group, `-NH₂`), because the basic amine acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`), \"poisoning\" it and deactivating the ring.\n*   **Temporary Directing Groups**: The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) in the options is a strong indication that an advanced strategy is required. This strategy involves creating a temporary amino group to control the position of other substituents before being removed.\n\n### **3. Systematically Analyze Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option from the question based on these principles.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: Steps (i) and (ii) form p-bromonitrobenzene (as the major product). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a nonsensical loop that does not advance the synthesis. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence describes a complex but chemically sound and well-established strategy.\n        1.  **Step i & ii**: Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, efficiently forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the crucial 1,3 pattern.\n        2.  **Step iii**: Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because of conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, while `-Br` is ortho,para), producing a mixture of isomers. This appears to be a low-yield step, but it is part of a larger plan.\n        3.  **Step iv**: The entire mixture of nitro-isomers is reduced to the corresponding mixture of amino-isomers, introducing a powerful temporary directing group.\n        4.  **Step v**: This is the brilliant, regioselective step. The mixture is nitrated a second time. This process is designed so that the desired final substitution pattern is achieved with high selectivity from the mixture of intermediates.\n        5.  **Step vi & vii**: The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This pathway, known as a convergent synthesis, is the only one that is chemically viable. It is cleverly designed to overcome the problem of conflicting directors by using a temporary directing group, thereby allowing for a high overall yield of the final complex product.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D are all invalidated by fundamental reaction failures or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that represents a complete, plausible, and elegant synthetic strategy to achieve the target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Goal\n\n*   **Target Molecule**: The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure**: A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement**: The synthesis must be \"high-yield\", meaning the reaction sequence must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of unwanted isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Key Chemical Principles and Constraints\n\n*   **Substituent Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical and is governed by the directing effects of each group in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NH₂` (Amino): Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**. (This group appears as an intermediate).\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations**: This is a crucial reaction for adding the acetyl group, but it has two severe limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (rings with an amino group, `-NH₂`) because the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option from the original question based on these principles.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence creates bromonitrobenzene (mainly the para-isomer) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This fails at step (iii). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: The first four steps—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence first prepares aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This fails at step (iii). The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating both the catalyst and the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n        1.  **(i) & (ii)**: First, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the meta-directing acetyl group. Subsequent bromination correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone efficiently.\n        2.  **(iii)**: Nitration of this molecule gives a **mixture of isomers** because of conflicting directing effects from the acetyl (meta) and bromo (ortho,para) groups.\n        3.  **(iv)**: The nitro groups on the entire mixture are reduced to amino groups, creating a powerful, temporary directing group.\n        4.  **(v)**: This is the brilliant, high-yield step. A second nitration is performed. For the main isomers in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step funnels the product mixture toward the desired structure.\n        5.  **(vi) & (vii)**: The temporary amino group, having served its strategic purpose, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is the only sequence that uses chemically viable steps throughout and employs a valid, elegant strategy to achieve a high overall yield for a challenging target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Goal and the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure Breakdown:** The target is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5 arrangement, meaning each substituent is *meta* to the other two.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which implies the reaction sequence must be chemically viable and designed for high selectivity.\n\n### **2. Establish Core Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\nTo correctly order the reactions, we must consider the directing effects of each group in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain key reactions.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl (`-COCH₃`)**: Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Nitro (`-NO₂`)**: Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo (`-Br`)**: Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **Amino (`-NH₂`)**: (Appears as an intermediate) Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) Limitations:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, is essential but sensitive. It fails under two conditions relevant here:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro (`-NO₂`) group.\n    2.  On aniline (rings with an amino (`-NH₂`) group), as the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n\n### **3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe will now analyze each provided sequence for its chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and removal of the diazonium group) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chemically futile loop and does not advance the synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    *   **Analysis:** Step (i) produces bromobenzene, and step (ii) nitrates it, primarily to p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n    *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, deactivating both the catalyst and the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence outlines a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step synthesis.\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. These first steps are efficient and selective.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is **not selective** because the directing effects of the acetyl group (*meta*) and the bromo group (*ortho,para*) are in conflict. This results in a mixture of isomers.\n        3.  **Steps iv - vii:** This is the elegant part of the strategy. The mixture of isomers is carried forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group, which is a powerful temporary director. Then, a second nitration is performed. In this crucial step, the directing effects of the powerful amino group and the acetyl group **work cooperatively**, directing the new nitro group to the **C5 position** with high selectivity for the major isomers in the mixture. This is a **convergent** step that funnels the mixture toward the correct product structure. Finally, the temporary amino group, its job done, is cleanly removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only option where all steps are chemically viable. It represents a classic \"convergent synthesis,\" a strategy designed to overcome selectivity problems in complex syntheses, thereby achieving a high overall yield.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain either nonsensical loops or chemically unviable reaction steps. Option B is the only sequence that represents a valid, albeit complex, pathway that successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on the Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce large amounts of unwanted isomers or that fail to proceed.\n\n### **2. Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other fundamental reaction limitations.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is crucial but is subject to strict rules. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n*   **Advanced Strategy Indication:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) in the options strongly suggests the use of a sophisticated strategy involving an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a temporary, powerful directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option provided in the question based on chemical viability and the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. As established, this reaction fails because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   This pathway is complex but represents a chemically sound and elegant solution, known as a convergent synthesis.\n        1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n        2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a selective step.\n        3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a critical step in the strategy. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is **not selective** because the directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` directs meta, while `-Br` directs ortho/para). This produces a mixture of isomers. While this seems to violate the \"high-yield\" rule, it is part of a larger plan.\n        4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group. This introduces a powerful, temporary directing group.\n        5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that redeems the synthesis. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For the major intermediates in the mixture (e.g., 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone), the powerful directing effects of the new amino group (ortho/para-director) and the original acetyl group (meta-director) **work together (cooperate)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediates into a single product line.\n        6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its crucial role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the target molecule.\n    *   This is the only chemically valid pathway that leads to a high overall yield.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This pathway is nonsensical. The first four steps (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) simply convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. The presence of the nitro group prevents the acylation from occurring. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option B describes a valid \"convergent synthesis\". Although it involves a non-selective intermediate step, the overall strategy is designed to resolve that mixture in a subsequent, highly selective step, leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product. This represents the most sophisticated and chemically correct pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which means the order of reactions must be chosen to maximize regioselectivity and avoid reaction failures.\n*   **Structure Analysis:** The benzene ring has three substituents in a 1,3,5-relationship (all are meta to each other):\n    1.  An **acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)** at position 1. This is a deactivating **meta-director**.\n    2.  A **bromo group (`-Br`)** at position 3. This is a deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n    3.  A **nitro group (`-NO₂`)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (using `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` to add the acetyl group) is critical but has major limitations.\n    *   It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    *   It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and \"poisons\" it, forming an unreactive complex.\n\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduction of `-NO₂` to `-NH₂`), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) in the options indicates a sophisticated strategy is likely needed. This involves using an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a powerful temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Methodically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option provided in the question based on the established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This pathway attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a bromonitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from proceeding. This is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   This sequence takes benzene, converts it to nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a **pointless loop** that makes no progress toward the final product. It simply regenerates the starting material.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it (step iii).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails** under standard conditions. The basic amino group (`-NH₂`) of aniline acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`), poisoning the catalyst and deactivating the ring. This is not a valid synthetic step as written.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound strategy known as a \"convergent synthesis.\"\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This start is efficient and selective.\n    2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step involves nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict (acetyl is *meta*, bromo is *ortho,para*), leading to a **mixture of isomers**.\n    3.  **Steps iv & v (Convergent Steps):** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group (`-NH₂`), creating a powerful temporary directing group. Then, a second nitration is performed. In this key step, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the new nitro group to the **same position (C5)** for the major isomers in the mixture. This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways, funneling the mixture from step iii toward the correct intermediate.\n    4.  **Steps vi & vii (Cleanup):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its critical role in directing the final substitution, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to give the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only option that is chemically sound from start to finish. It uses a well-established and elegant synthetic design to overcome the challenge of a complex substitution pattern, resulting in a high overall yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5 arrangement. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to one another.\n    *   **Goal:** The task requires finding a \"high-yield\" synthesis from benzene. This implies that the reaction sequence must be chemically valid and highly selective (regioselective) to maximize the desired product.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Key Chemical Principles and Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Substituent Directing Effects:** The success of the synthesis depends on correctly sequencing the reactions based on how substituents direct new groups in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n        *   `-COCH₃` (acetyl) is a deactivating **meta-director**.\n        *   `-Br` (bromo) is a deactivating **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NO₂` (nitro) is a strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (amino, used as a temporary intermediate) is a strongly activating **ortho,para-director**. When protonated in strong acid to `-NH₃⁺`, it becomes a deactivating **meta-director**.\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations:** This reaction is critical for adding the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) but has crucial limitations:\n        *   It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as one containing a nitro group.\n        *   It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the `AlCl₃` Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that does not advance the synthesis. It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) produce bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents Friedel-Crafts acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline (`-NH₂`). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating it and the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step \"convergent synthesis.\"\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group then correctly places bromine at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. These steps are selective and valid.\n        2.  **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step is not highly selective because of conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is *meta*, while -Br is *ortho,para*), which produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n        3.  **Steps iv & v:** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The nitro groups on the isomer mixture are reduced to amino groups (`-NH₂`), which act as powerful temporary directors (step iv). Then, a second nitration is performed (step v). In the strongly acidic nitrating medium, the amino group is protonated to an anilinium ion (`-NH₃⁺`), which is a *meta*-director. This `-NH₃⁺` group and the original `-COCH₃` group now work together to direct the incoming nitro group to the **C5 position**. This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways, funneling the mixture from step iii toward the correct intermediate.\n        4.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino/anilinium group, having fulfilled its strategic purpose, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is the only option that describes a complete and viable chemical pathway. The use of a temporary directing group in a convergent strategy is a classic approach to achieve a high overall yield for a complex target molecule like this one.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on a thorough analysis of chemical principles and reaction constraints, Options B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible steps or nonsensical loops. Option A describes a valid, albeit complex, synthetic route that correctly leads to the target molecule with a high overall yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on the Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three substituents are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This necessitates a highly selective (regioselective) pathway that avoids major reaction failures or the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nThe success of the synthesis depends on strategically navigating the directing effects of substituents and avoiding known reaction failures.\n\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Crucial Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is very sensitive and **fails** under two conditions relevant to this problem:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    2.  On aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Methodically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on its chemical viability and adherence to the principles above.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction is well-known to fail because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Thus, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. The presence of the powerfully deactivating nitro group prevents the acylation from occurring. Thus, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    This pathway is nonsensical. The first four steps (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) simply convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not advance the synthesis toward the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    This pathway is complex but represents a chemically sound, elegant, and ultimately high-yield solution known as a \"convergent synthesis.\"\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation) & ii (Bromination):** Benzene is first converted to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This initial setup is selective and efficient.\n    2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a key strategic step. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is **not selective** because the directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` directs meta to C5, while `-Br` directs ortho/para to C2, C4, C6). This produces a mixture of isomers. While this seems to violate the \"high-yield\" rule, it is part of a larger plan.\n    3.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the entire mixture of isomers is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group. This introduces a powerful, temporary directing group.\n    4.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that redeems the synthesis. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the new amino group (ortho,para) and the original acetyl group (meta) **work together (converge)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediates into a single product line.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its crucial role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only one that describes a valid synthetic strategy. Although it involves a non-selective intermediate step, the overall strategy is designed to resolve that mixture in a subsequent, highly selective step, leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product. This represents the most sophisticated and chemically correct pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, maximizing the formation of the desired product over isomers.\n\n### **2. Review Key Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and the limitations of certain reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, is essential but has two critical constraints:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as one with a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with a basic `-NH₂` group), as the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`) and poisons it.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option from the Prompt**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for its chemical viability and its ability to achieve a high yield.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical and futile loop that makes no progress toward the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring and poisoning the catalyst. Therefore, this pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** Steps (i) and (ii) produce 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as the major product. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction fails. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n        1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group then correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is efficient.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para) and produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group, creating a powerful temporary directing group.\n        4.  **Step v:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture is nitrated a second time. For the major isomers, the directing effects of the powerful amino group (ortho,para) and the acetyl group (meta) now **cooperate**, both directing the incoming nitro group to the same position, **C5**. This highly selective step \"funnels\" the mixture toward the correct substitution pattern.\n        5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic, high-yield synthetic strategy for complex targets. It is the only option that is chemically valid and complete.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target:** The product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.

It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those with a nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n        2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group, `-NH₂`), because the basic amine group reacts with and \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n    *   **Advanced Strategies:** The reagents `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) strongly indicate a sophisticated synthesis using a temporary directing group, which is introduced to control substitution and later removed.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Based on the Provided Question:**\n    Let's analyze the specific options provided in the question.\n\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence first creates bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This pathway fails. The Friedel-Crafts reaction does not work on the ring once it is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   **Analysis:** This option describes a complex but sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n            *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the meta-directing acetyl group ensures selective bromination at C3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step iii:** This intermediate is nitrated.

Although complex, it represents a known, elegant strategy to achieve a high overall yield for the target molecule. All of the candidate analyses, despite their final letter choices being scrambled, agree on the chemical reasoning that makes this specific sequence the correct one.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, beginning with benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern. All three groups are *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**. This implies that the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant amounts of unwanted isomers or that fail to proceed effectively.\n\n### 2. Analyze Key Chemical Principles and Constraints\nTo devise a successful synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other fundamental reaction limitations.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-NH₂` (Amino): Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**. This group can be used as a powerful temporary directing group.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) Constraints:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, has critical limitations:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n*   **Analysis of Simple Routes:**\n    *   A direct bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone would be very slow due to the presence of two strong deactivating groups.\n    *   A direct nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone would lead to poor selectivity and a mixture of products because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict.\n    *   These issues suggest that a more complex strategy using a temporary directing group is necessary to meet the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option from the Prompt\n\nLet's evaluate each option for its chemical viability.\n\n*   **A) `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**\n    *   **Flaw:** The first four steps (i-iv) take benzene, nitrate it, reduce it, diazotize it, and deaminate it, resulting in the regeneration of the starting material, benzene.

Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA) directly on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   **Flaw:** Steps (i) and (ii) synthesize bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) then attempts an FCA on this molecule. The reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence outlines a valid, albeit complex, \"convergent synthesis\" designed to overcome the limitations of simpler routes.\n        1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene gives acetophenone.\n        2.  **Step ii:** The meta-directing acetyl group ensures selective bromination at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n        3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step nitratates 3-bromoacetophenone. Because of conflicting directors, this produces a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone). This step is part of a larger strategy.\n        4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group, creating a temporary, powerful directing group (e.g., `3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone`).\n        5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the crucial, high-yield step. For the intermediate (`3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone`), the powerful `-NH₂` group (directing to C5, para) and the `-COCH₃` group (directing to C5, meta) now **work cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, C5, with very high selectivity. This \"convergent\" step funnels the product mixture toward the desired precursor: `3-bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone`.\n        6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group at C4, having fulfilled its role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only chemically sound and complete pathway that accounts for the \"high-yield\" requirement by using a sophisticated, multi-step strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
