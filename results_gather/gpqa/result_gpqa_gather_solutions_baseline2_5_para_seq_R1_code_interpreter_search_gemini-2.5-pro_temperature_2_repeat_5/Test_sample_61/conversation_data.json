Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n2.  **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The structure of this molecule is key to understanding the required reaction pathway.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon aldehyde.\n    *   The substituent at position 1 (the same carbon bearing the aldehyde) is `-(CH(OH)-C₆H₁₁)`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Aldol Addition.** The final product is an α-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** between two molecules of the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate. This means the synthesis is a two-stage process.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulation of the Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe overall process must be broken down into two main stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** The 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) must be converted into the 7-carbon intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires a reaction that can cleave off one carbon atom from the side chain while forming an aldehyde. The most effective way to do this is via controlled ozonolysis.\n2.  **Dimerization:** The aldehyde intermediate must then be dimerized using a base-catalyzed aldol addition reaction to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **Step 3: Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Proposed Reagent Sequence**\n\nWe will evaluate each option based on this two-stage strategy and established chemical principles.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Incomplete vs. Complete Hydrogenation.** The second step uses `H₂/Pd`. This catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This removes the necessary reactivity for subsequent steps, making this pathway a synthetic dead end. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Reductive vs. Oxidative Ozonolysis.** The third step is ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This is an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the molecule but would oxidize the fragments to carboxylic acids (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), not the required aldehyde intermediate. Since the aldehyde is necessary for the final aldol reaction, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the strong base `NaNH₂` and alkylated with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyle, preparing it for a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene without over-reducing it.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup is a **reductive workup**. This reaction correctly cleaves the alkene to yield the desired aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the intermediate to form the final target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This entire sequence is chemically sound and follows the correct, logical pathway.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Acid-Base Compatibility.** The very first step is chemically flawed. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base that would simply be neutralized by the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in an unproductive acid-base reaction. This prevents the desired reaction with the alkyne from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of all steps and potential pitfalls, only option C describes a completely valid and logical synthetic route.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). We can represent the cyclohexane group as \"Cy,\" so the molecule is `Cy-C≡CH`. It contains 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's deconstruct this name:\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which has the structure `Cy-CHO`.\n    *   A complex substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)-`, is attached at position 1. This substituent's structure is `-CH(OH)Cy`.\n    *   This overall structure is an α-hydroxy aldehyde and contains two cyclohexane rings for a total of 14 carbons.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Aldol Reaction.** The final product is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate. This key intermediate must be **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`Cy-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`Cy-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (`Cy-CHO`). This requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain.\n2.  **Aldol Addition:** Use a base to catalyze the dimerization of the aldehyde intermediate to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence with Key Careful Points**\n\nWe will evaluate each option against this strategy, identifying critical flaws.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** `NaNH₂` (a strong base) deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide ion attacks `methyl chloride`. This correctly converts the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne (`Cy-C≡C-CH₃`), setting up a controlled cleavage.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.**\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Partial vs. Complete Hydrogenation):** It is crucial to reduce the alkyne to an alkene without over-reducing it to an unreactive alkane. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs this **partial reduction** to a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Reductive vs. Oxidative Workup):** To cleave the alkene into aldehydes, a **reductive workup** is required. `O₃` followed by `(CH₃)₂S` correctly achieves this, yielding the desired intermediate `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. An oxidative workup would incorrectly yield a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the final aldol addition.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the correct logic in every step.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Reagent Incompatibility):** The first step is fatally flawed. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base, and `methanol` is a protic solvent. The base will be immediately neutralized by the solvent in a simple acid-base reaction, preventing it from reacting with the alkyne as intended.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Revisited):** The second step uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison. This catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane. This is a synthetic dead end.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Revisited):** The third step uses ozonolysis followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the alkene but oxidize the fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nBased on a thorough step-by-step analysis, the sequence of reagents presented in **Option A** is the only one that provides a completely correct and logical pathway to the desired product. It correctly prepares the necessary aldehyde intermediate through a specific sequence of alkylation, partial hydrogenation, and reductive ozonolysis, and then correctly employs a base to catalyze the final aldol reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal: Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `Ethynylcyclohexane`. This is an 8-carbon molecule with a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. The IUPAC name reveals several key features:\n    *   The molecule is an α-hydroxy aldehyde, a characteristic product of an **aldol addition** reaction.\n    *   The structure contains two cyclohexane rings and 14 carbon atoms total.\n    *   This implies that the reaction is a **self-aldol addition** where two molecules of an intermediate have reacted.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The direct precursor required for the aldol reaction is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon aldehyde.\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be planned in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires cleaving one carbon from the alkyne side chain and installing an aldehyde group.\n*   **Stage 2: Aldol Reaction.** Treat the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final product.\n\nThe most controlled method for Stage 1 involves modifying the alkyne, partially reducing it, and then cleaving it with reductive ozonolysis.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Proposed Sequence with Careful Points**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against this logical strategy, identifying the fatal flaw in each incorrect sequence.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    1.  **Alkylation:** The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and `methyl chloride` alkylates it to form an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`). This is a correct first step to control the subsequent cleavage.\n    2.  **Partial Reduction:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) correctly performs a partial reduction, converting the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene without over-reducing it to an alkane.\n    3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup correctly cleaves the alkene via a **reductive pathway**, yielding the required `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate.\n    4.  **Aldol Addition:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction of the intermediate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This entire sequence is chemically sound and follows the ideal synthetic plan.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Reagent Incompatibility):** This sequence fails at the first step. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base and will be neutralized by the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in an unproductive acid-base reaction. This prevents the desired reaction with the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Incorrect Ozonolysis Workup):** The flaw is in step 3. Ozonolysis followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`) is an **oxidative workup**. This process would oxidize the alkene fragments to unwanted carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point (Incorrect Hydrogenation):** The fatal flaw is in step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a poisoning agent) performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This is a synthetic dead end. The numbering is also incoherent.\n\nAfter a thorough step-by-step analysis, sequence A is the only one that represents a completely correct and logical synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Final Reaction.** This complex IUPAC name describes a specific type of structure. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), and it has a large substituent at its alpha-position. This α-hydroxy aldehyde structure, which contains two cyclohexane rings for a total of 14 carbons, is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. Therefore, the main synthetic challenge is to first prepare this key intermediate.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n    *   **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** We must convert the 8-carbon starting material (ethynylcyclohexane) into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde). This transformation requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain while installing an aldehyde functional group. A robust method is to convert the alkyne into a specifically substituted alkene, which can then be cleaved by ozonolysis.\n    *   **Stage 2: Aldol Addition.** The `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate is then treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final C14 product.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence of Reagents**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze each option, looking for flaws based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting nucleophile reacts with `methyl chloride`. This correctly converts the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne`), setting up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2: Careful Point 2 (Partial vs. Complete Reduction).** The reagent `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. This is a \"poisoned\" catalyst, essential for performing a **partial reduction** of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, crucially preventing over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.\n    *   **Step 3: Careful Point 3 (Reductive vs. Oxidative Workup).** `O₃` followed by `(CH₃)₂S` is ozonolysis with a **reductive workup**. This specific workup is required to cleave the alkene into aldehydes. This step correctly produces the target intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable strong base to catalyze the final self-aldol addition reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound in every step and follows a logical, correct synthetic strategy.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The flaw is in step 3. An ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` (in the absence of a reducing agent like Zn) constitutes an **oxidative workup**. This would oxidize the fragments to carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The flaw is in step 1. **Careful Point 4 (Reagent Compatibility).** The very strong base `NaNH₂` will react with the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in a simple acid-base neutralization. This side reaction consumes the reagent, preventing it from deprotonating the alkyne.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The flaw is in step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a poison) performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane. This is a synthetic dead end.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, sequence A is the only one that provides a completely valid and logical pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **1.

The name and implied structure (a 14-carbon molecule with two cyclohexane rings and an α-hydroxy aldehyde functional group) reveal that it is the product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The required intermediate that must be synthesized first is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Synthetic Strategy**\nThe overall synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This transformation requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain while installing an aldehyde functional group. The most controlled way to do this is via ozonolysis of an alkene.

This is an 8-carbon molecule with a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Analysis of the Product:** The name and carbon count (14 carbons, two cyclohexane rings) reveal that this molecule is the product of a dimerization reaction. Specifically, the α-hydroxy aldehyde functional group is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition** between two molecules of a key intermediate.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The intermediate that undergoes the aldol reaction must be **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n\n### **2.

This would prevent the intended reaction (deprotonation of the alkyne) from occurring.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Ozonolysis Workup):** This sequence fails at step 3. The ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This is an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the alkene but produce a carboxylic acid (`cyclohexanecarboxylic acid`), not the aldehyde (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`) required for the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n*   **D) 1.

This key intermediate must be **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** The 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) must be converted into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires cleaving one carbon from the side chain. The most controlled way to do this is to convert the alkyne to a specific alkene and then use ozonolysis.\n*   **Stage 2: Aldol Addition.** The synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction to form the final product.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option with Key Chemical \"Careful Points\"**\n\nWe will evaluate each sequence, looking for fatal flaws based on fundamental chemical principles.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride 2. Li/liq. NH₃ 3. O₃/ H₂O 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Ozonolysis Workup):** The crucial flaw is in step 3. Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`) is an **oxidative workup**. This process oxidizes the cleaved fragments into carboxylic acids (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), not the aldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) required for the subsequent aldol reaction. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride 2. H₂/Pd 3. Ba(OH)₂ 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point (Hydrogenation Selectivity):** The flaw is in step 2. `H₂/Pd` is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). An alkane cannot undergo ozonolysis, making this a synthetic dead end. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated with the strong base `NaNH₂` and alkylated with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne. This sets up a controlled ozonolysis.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne to an alkene without over-reducing it.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃` followed by a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup is a **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction correctly cleaves the double bond to yield the desired aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the **aldol addition** of the intermediate, forming the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the correct strategic pathway.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol 2. Li/liq. NH₃ 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Reagent Compatibility):** This sequence fails at the very first step. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base that will react with the protic solvent, `methanol` (an alcohol), in a simple acid-base neutralization. The base would be consumed, preventing the intended deprotonation of the much less acidic alkyne. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option C describes a completely correct and logical synthetic route.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   The parent name is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), which is a 7-carbon molecule.\n    *   The structure described by the full name contains two cyclohexane rings and is an α-hydroxy aldehyde. This specific structure is the well-known product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate.\n*   **Conclusion:** The overall goal is to first synthesize the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate and then use a base to cause it to react with itself to form the final product.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Ideal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe core challenge is the conversion of the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires cleavage of one C-C bond and installation of an aldehyde. A robust strategy for this is:\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** Convert the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne to allow for a controlled cleavage. This involves deprotonation with a strong base (`NaNH₂`) followed by reaction with a simple alkyl halide (`CH₃Cl`).\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** Reduce the internal alkyne to an alkene, but crucially, stop the reaction before it proceeds to an alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-CaCO₃`) is required.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** Cleave the alkene's double bond using ozone (`O₃`) and, critically, use a **reductive workup** (e.g., `(CH₃)₂S` or `Zn/H₂O`) to obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate.\n4.  **Aldol Addition:** Use a base (e.g., `Ba(OH)₂` or `NaOH`) to catalyze the aldol addition of the aldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **3.

The base would be neutralized by the solvent in a simple acid-base reaction, preventing the intended deprotonation of the alkyne. The option is incorrect.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Careful Point (Ozonolysis Workup):** This sequence fails at step 3. The ozonolysis is followed by a workup with `H₂O` (in the absence of a reducing agent like Zn), which constitutes an **oxidative workup**. This would produce a carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction. The option is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly matches the ideal strategy.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Correct.\n    2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** Correctly uses Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-CaCO₃`) to stop at the alkene.\n    3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** Correctly uses `O₃` with a reductive workup (`(CH₃)₂S`) to form the necessary aldehyde intermediate.\n    4.  **Aldol Addition:** Correctly uses a suitable base (`Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the final step.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is the only chemically sound pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must first devise a logical synthetic strategy and then evaluate each option against it, paying close attention to the specific function and potential pitfalls of each reagent.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane.

A reliable method for this is a sequence of alkyne modification followed by ozonolysis.\n    *   **Stage 2: Dimerization (Aldol Reaction).** The `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the aldol addition, forming the final product.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence with Careful Points.**\n\n    *   **A) 1.

Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy', making the structure `Cy-C≡CH`.\n\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The name and structure reveal two critical facts:\n    1.  The product contains two cyclohexane rings and has a total of 14 carbons, which is almost double the starting material. This implies a dimerization reaction occurred at some point.\n    2.  The structure is an α-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The final product is formed by the dimerization of two molecules of an intermediate.

Evaluation of Each Proposed Sequence with Careful Points**\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against this two-stage strategy, identifying the key chemical principle that validates or invalidates each step.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point (Complete vs. Partial Hydrogenation):** This sequence is flawed at step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd`, without a poisoning agent, performs **complete hydrogenation**.

Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Reductive vs. Oxidative Workup):** This sequence fails at step 3. The ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This is an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the cleaved alkene fragments into carboxylic acids (`Cy-COOH`), not the aldehydes (`Cy-CHO`) required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1 (Alkylation):** Correct. The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting nucleophile is alkylated by `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`Cy-C≡C-CH₃`).

This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Reaction Pattern.** The final product's name and structure (a 14-carbon α-hydroxy aldehyde with two cyclohexane rings) are characteristic of a **self-aldol addition** reaction. This means the synthesis is a two-stage process. The first stage must create an intermediate, which then reacts with itself in the second stage.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The required intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n*   **Strategic Goal:** The core of the problem is to find a sequence that converts the 8-carbon starting material into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate and then uses a base to catalyze the aldol reaction.\n\n### **2. Outline the Required Synthetic Steps**\n\nTo transform `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` into `C₆H₁₁-CHO`, a C-C bond must be cleaved. A standard, controllable method for this is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** The terminal alkyne must be converted into an internal alkyne to control the cleavage products. This involves deprotonation with a strong base (`NaNH₂`) followed by reaction with a simple alkyl halide (e.g., `CH₃Cl`). This creates `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene, but not all the way to an alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required for this.\n3.  **Reductive Cleavage:** The alkene is cleaved using ozonolysis (`O₃`) with a specific workup to produce aldehydes.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** The aldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to induce the self-aldol addition reaction.\n\n### **3.

The ozonolysis reaction (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`).

Without a \"poisoning\" agent (like CaCO₃), this catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane). This is a synthetic dead end, so this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by `NaNH₂` and alkylated with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. **Careful Point 3: Partial Reduction.** This is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne into an alkene without over-reducing it. This is precisely what is needed.\n    *   **Step 3:** `O₃` followed by `(CH₃)₂S`. **Careful Point 4: Reductive Ozonolysis.** This is a reductive workup, which is essential to cleave the alkene and produce the desired **aldehyde** intermediate (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`).\n    *   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the final aldol addition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the entire logical pathway correctly.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Reagent Incompatibility.** The first step is fundamentally flawed. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base, and methanol is a protic solvent. The base would be neutralized in an acid-base reaction with the solvent, preventing the intended reaction with the alkyne. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 6: Oxidative Ozonolysis.** The third step uses ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the alkene but produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only sequence B provides a chemically correct and logical pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify the starting material and the final product to understand the required transformation.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `Ethynylcyclohexane`. This is an 8-carbon molecule composed of a cyclohexane ring bonded to a terminal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a complex 14-carbon molecule. Its structure reveals it is the result of a dimerization reaction.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Aldol Reaction.** The structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde containing two identical cyclohexyl units, is the classic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction. This means the immediate precursor to the final product is two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This requires a controlled cleavage of one carbon atom.\n2.  **Dimerization:** Treat the aldehyde intermediate with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final product.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed sequence against this established two-stage strategy, identifying the key flaw in each incorrect option.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/(CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`). This is a correct and necessary first step to set up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst.\n        *   **Careful Point 2 (Partial vs. Complete Hydrogenation):** This \"poisoned\" catalyst correctly performs a partial reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. It crucially prevents over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`).\n        *   **Careful Point 3 (Reductive vs. Oxidative Ozonolysis):** This is a **reductive workup**, which is essential to cleave the alkene and obtain the required **aldehyde** intermediate (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`).\n    *   **Step 4:** Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is a suitable base to catalyze the final **aldol addition** reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the entire logical pathway.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 3 uses an `H₂O` workup for the ozonolysis. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would incorrectly produce a carboxylic acid (`cyclohexanecarboxylic acid`) instead of the aldehyde needed for the aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/(CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 1 is chemically invalid.\n        *   **Careful Point 4 (Reagent Incompatibility):** The extremely strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized in an immediate acid-base reaction with the protic solvent, `methanol`. This would prevent the desired deprotonation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poisoning agent. This catalyst causes **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This is a synthetic dead end. The numbering of the steps is also incoherent.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical principles and potential pitfalls, only the sequence of reagents presented in Option A provides a completely valid and logical synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a cyclohexane ring and a terminal alkyne functional group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde containing two cyclohexane rings, is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** To form the final 14-carbon product via a dimerization, the 8-carbon starting material must first be converted into the 7-carbon intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe transformation requires a C-C bond cleavage and must be performed in two main stages:\n1.  **Stage I: Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate.** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This involves cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain while creating an aldehyde. The most effective way to achieve this controlled cleavage is by first converting the alkyne into a specifically structured alkene, and then using ozonolysis.\n2.  **Stage II: The Aldol Reaction.** Treat the synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction, forming the final target product.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Proposed Sequence with Careful Points**\n\nWe will evaluate each option against this logical, two-stage strategy, identifying the key flaw in each incorrect sequence.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point: Catalyst for Hydrogenation.** This sequence fails at step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a poisoning agent) performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). An alkane is a synthetic dead end for this pathway. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point: Ozonolysis Workup.** This sequence fails at step 3. The ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the alkene but oxidize the resulting fragments to carboxylic acids (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), not the required aldehyde intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) needed for the final aldol reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting nucleophile is alkylated by `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`).\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne into a *cis*-alkene without over-reducing it to an alkane.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a **reductive workup** with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) correctly cleaves the alkene's double bond to yield the desired aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is a suitable strong base to catalyze the final **aldol addition** of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This entire sequence is chemically sound and follows a logical pathway to the desired product.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point: Reagent Compatibility.** This sequence fails at step 1. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base that would be neutralized by the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in a simple acid-base reaction. This would prevent the intended deprotonation of the much less acidic alkyne.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Final Reaction.** The final product is a 14-carbon molecule. Its structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde (when considering the bond formed), and its formation from an 8-carbon starting material strongly indicate a multi-step synthesis involving dimerization. This specific structure is the classic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** For a self-aldol reaction to create the final 14-carbon product, two molecules of a 7-carbon intermediate must react. This necessary intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n*   **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must therefore proceed in two major stages:\n    1.  Convert the 8-carbon ethynylcyclohexane into the 7-carbon cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    2.  Treat the aldehyde intermediate with a base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction.\n\n### **2. Outline of the Ideal Synthesis of the Intermediate**\n\nThe transformation of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) requires the cleavage of a C-C bond. A highly controlled method for this is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Convert the terminal alkyne to an internal alkyne to control the products of cleavage. This is done by deprotonating with a strong base (like `NaNH₂`) and reacting with a one-carbon alkylating agent (`CH₃Cl`) to form `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** Reduce the alkyne to an alkene without over-reducing to an unreactive alkane. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** Cleave the alkene's double bond with ozone (`O₃`) and use a reductive workup (like `(CH₃)₂S`) to ensure the products are aldehydes.\n\n### **3.

NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Reagent Incompatibility):** This sequence fails at step 1. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base. It will be immediately neutralized by the protic solvent, `methanol`, in an unproductive acid-base reaction, preventing the desired deprotonation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (Hydrogenation Selectivity):** This sequence fails at step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a poisoning agent like `CaCO₃`) performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`), making this pathway a synthetic dead end.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is alkylated to form an internal alkyne.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) performs a selective **partial reduction** to the alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃` with a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup is a **reductive ozonolysis**, which correctly cleaves the alkene to give the desired `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the final **aldol addition**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence perfectly matches the ideal synthetic strategy and is chemically sound in every step.\n\n<<<D>>>"

It contains 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's deconstruct this name:\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which has the structure `Cy-CHO`.\n    *   A complex substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)-`, is attached at position 1. This substituent's structure is `-CH(OH)Cy`.\n    *   This overall structure is an α-hydroxy aldehyde and contains two cyclohexane rings for a total of 14 carbons.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Aldol Reaction.** The final product is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate.

This is a synthetic dead end. The numbering is also incoherent.\n\nAfter a thorough step-by-step analysis, sequence A is the only one that represents a completely correct and logical synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Final Reaction.** This complex IUPAC name describes a specific type of structure. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), and it has a large substituent at its alpha-position. This α-hydroxy aldehyde structure, which contains two cyclohexane rings for a total of 14 carbons, is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. Therefore, the main synthetic challenge is to first prepare this key intermediate.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n    *   **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** We must convert the 8-carbon starting material (ethynylcyclohexane) into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde). This transformation requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain while installing an aldehyde functional group. A robust method is to convert the alkyne into a specifically substituted alkene, which can then be cleaved by ozonolysis.\n    *   **Stage 2: Aldol Addition.** The `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate is then treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final C14 product.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence of Reagents**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze each option, looking for flaws based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting nucleophile reacts with `methyl chloride`. This correctly converts the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne`), setting up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2: Careful Point 2 (Partial vs. Complete Reduction).** The reagent `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. This is a \"poisoned\" catalyst, essential for performing a **partial reduction** of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, crucially preventing over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.\n    *   **Step 3: Careful Point 3 (Reductive vs. Oxidative Workup).** `O₃` followed by `(CH₃)₂S` is ozonolysis with a **reductive workup**. This specific workup is required to cleave the alkene into aldehydes. This step correctly produces the target intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable strong base to catalyze the final self-aldol addition reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound in every step and follows a logical, correct synthetic strategy.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The flaw is in step 3. An ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` (in the absence of a reducing agent like Zn) constitutes an **oxidative workup**. This would oxidize the fragments to carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The flaw is in step 1. **Careful Point 4 (Reagent Compatibility).** The very strong base `NaNH₂` will react with the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in a simple acid-base neutralization. This side reaction consumes the reagent, preventing it from deprotonating the alkyne.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The flaw is in step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a poison) performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane.

This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The name and implied structure (a 14-carbon molecule with two cyclohexane rings and an α-hydroxy aldehyde functional group) reveal that it is the product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The required intermediate that must be synthesized first is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Synthetic Strategy**\nThe overall synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This transformation requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain while installing an aldehyde functional group. The most controlled way to do this is via ozonolysis of an alkene. Therefore, the strategy will be: Alkyne → Modified Alkyne → Alkene → Aldehyde intermediate.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the aldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option with Careful Points**\n\nWe will evaluate each sequence based on this strategy, identifying critical flaws.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Careful Point (Hydrogenation):** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`. This catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This is a synthetic dead-end. The option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4.

This prevents the desired reaction with the alkyne from occurring. The option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Ozonolysis Workup):** Step 3 is an ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would oxidize the cleaved fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction. The option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated with the strong base `NaNH₂` and alkylated with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`).\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction** of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃` followed by a dimethyl sulfide `(CH₃)₂S` workup is a **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction correctly cleaves the double bond to yield the desired aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the **aldol addition** of the intermediate, forming the final target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only sequence that represents a chemically sound and complete pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **1.

This is an 8-carbon molecule with a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Analysis of the Product:** The name and carbon count (14 carbons, two cyclohexane rings) reveal that this molecule is the product of a dimerization reaction. Specifically, the α-hydroxy aldehyde functional group is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition** between two molecules of a key intermediate.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The intermediate that undergoes the aldol reaction must be **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe transformation requires a two-stage approach:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires a specific C-C bond cleavage.\n2.  **Aldol Addition:** Catalyze the self-aldol reaction of the intermediate using a base to form the final product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Strategy**\n\nWe must find the sequence where every step is chemically sound and leads logically to the next. The synthesis of the intermediate (Stage 1) is the most complex part and relies on several key reactions.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point (Hydrogenation):** This sequence fails at step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a \"poison\" like CaCO₃) performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive saturated alkane (propylcyclohexane), which is a synthetic dead-end. The reaction cannot proceed.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Reagent Incompatibility):** This sequence fails at step 1. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base. It would be immediately neutralized by the protic solvent, methanol (`CH₃OH`), in an acid-base reaction. This would prevent the intended reaction (deprotonation of the alkyne) from occurring.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Ozonolysis Workup):** This sequence fails at step 3. The ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This is an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the alkene but produce a carboxylic acid (`cyclohexanecarboxylic acid`), not the aldehyde (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`) required for the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the strong base `NaNH₂`, and the resulting nucleophile reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`). This prepares the molecule for a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene without over-reducing it to an alkane.\n    *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** Correct. `O₃` followed by a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup is a **reductive workup**. This correctly cleaves the alkene's double bond to yield the desired aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol addition of the intermediate, forming the final target product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter a systematic analysis, sequence D is the only one that represents a chemically correct and complete pathway.

A robust strategy for this is:\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** Convert the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne to allow for a controlled cleavage. This involves deprotonation with a strong base (`NaNH₂`) followed by reaction with a simple alkyl halide (`CH₃Cl`).\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** Reduce the internal alkyne to an alkene, but crucially, stop the reaction before it proceeds to an alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-CaCO₃`) is required.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** Cleave the alkene's double bond using ozone (`O₃`) and, critically, use a **reductive workup** (e.g., `(CH₃)₂S` or `Zn/H₂O`) to obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate.\n4.  **Aldol Addition:** Use a base (e.g., `Ba(OH)₂` or `NaOH`) to catalyze the aldol addition of the aldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **3.

It would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive saturated alkane (propylcyclohexane), which is a synthetic dead end. The synthesis cannot proceed.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Reductive vs. Oxidative Workup):** This sequence fails at step 3. The ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This is an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the cleaved alkene fragments into carboxylic acids (`Cy-COOH`), not the aldehydes (`Cy-CHO`) required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1 (Alkylation):** Correct. The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting nucleophile is alkylated by `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`Cy-C≡C-CH₃`). This is a correct first step to set up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2 (Partial Reduction):** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene without over-reducing it to an alkane.\n    *   **Step 3 (Reductive Ozonolysis):** Correct. `O₃` followed by a dimethyl sulfide `(CH₃)₂S` workup is a **reductive workup**. This reaction correctly cleaves the double bond to yield the desired aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4 (Aldol Addition):** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the intermediate, forming the final target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence represents a complete and chemically sound pathway.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point (Reagent Compatibility):** This sequence is flawed from the very first step. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base. It will react with the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in an immediate and unproductive acid-base neutralization. This prevents the intended reaction with the alkyne.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the only one that presents a chemically valid and logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide on the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Overall Chemical Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Reaction Pattern.** The final product's name and structure (a 14-carbon α-hydroxy aldehyde with two cyclohexane rings) are characteristic of a **self-aldol addition** reaction. This means the synthesis is a two-stage process. The first stage must create an intermediate, which then reacts with itself in the second stage.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The required intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon molecule.\n*   **Strategic Goal:** The core of the problem is to find a sequence that converts the 8-carbon starting material into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate and then uses a base to catalyze the aldol reaction.\n\n### **2. Outline the Required Synthetic Steps**\n\nTo transform `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` into `C₆H₁₁-CHO`, a C-C bond must be cleaved. A standard, controllable method for this is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** The terminal alkyne must be converted into an internal alkyne to control the cleavage products. This involves deprotonation with a strong base (`NaNH₂`) followed by reaction with a simple alkyl halide (e.g., `CH₃Cl`). This creates `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene, but not all the way to an alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required for this.\n3.  **Reductive Cleavage:** The alkene is cleaved using ozonolysis (`O₃`) with a specific workup to produce aldehydes.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** The aldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to induce the self-aldol addition reaction.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Correct Strategy**\n\nLet's evaluate the options as they are presented in the main question.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Compatibility.** This fails at the first step. The strong base (`NaNH₂`) will be neutralized by the acidic proton of the solvent (`methanol`), preventing the intended reaction with the alkyne. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O₃/ H₂O...**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Reductive vs. Oxidative Workup.** This fails at step 3. Ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O` is an **oxidative workup**. This would produce a carboxylic acid (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), not the aldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) needed for the final aldol reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Complete vs. Partial Hydrogenation.** This fails at step 2. The catalyst `H₂/Pd` (without a poisoning agent) causes **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (`C₆H₁₁-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). This is a synthetic dead end. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct alkylation of the terminal alkyne to an internal one.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct use of Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-CaCO₃`) to perform a partial reduction to an alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct use of reductive ozonolysis (`O₃` followed by `(CH₃)₂S`) to cleave the alkene into the required aldehyde intermediate.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct use of a base (`Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the final aldol addition reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence perfectly matches the required synthetic strategy in every step.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, the sequence of reagents listed in option D is the only one that provides a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule from the given starting material.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n\nFirst, we must analyze the starting material and the target product to understand the overall chemical transformation required.\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`), giving it a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The name itself reveals a complex structure. A careful look shows it is an α-hydroxy aldehyde containing two cyclohexane rings. This structure is the hallmark of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** For a self-aldol addition to form the 14-carbon final product, two molecules of a 7-carbon intermediate must react. This crucial intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** The 8-carbon starting material (`ethynylcyclohexane`) must be converted into the 7-carbon aldehyde intermediate (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`). This requires cleaving one carbon atom while creating an aldehyde group.\n*   **Stage 2: Dimerization.** The synthesized aldehyde intermediate must be treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction, forming the final C-C bond and the target product.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Proposed Sequence and Identification of \"Careful Points\"**\n\nWe will evaluate each option against this logical strategy, identifying the key chemical principle that validates the correct path and invalidates the incorrect ones.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Careful Point (Ozonolysis Workup):** The fatal flaw is in Step 3. The ozonolysis reaction (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would oxidize the cleaved alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate needed for the aldol reaction. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n*   **Step 1:** The strong base `NaNH₂` correctly deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and reaction with `methyl chloride` forms an internal alkyne. This is a sound strategic move.\n*   **Step 2:** **Careful Point (Hydrogenation Selectivity):** The reagent `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It is specifically designed for the **partial reduction** of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, which is precisely what is needed here. It prevents over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.\n*   **Step 3:** The ozonolysis is followed by a **reductive workup** with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`). This correctly cleaves the alkene to yield the aldehyde intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n*   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the final aldol addition reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound, and every step logically leads toward the final product.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Careful Point (Acid-Base Reactivity):** The sequence fails at Step 1. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base, and `methanol` is a protic solvent. The two would immediately undergo an unproductive acid-base reaction, neutralizing the base and preventing the intended reaction with the alkyne. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n*   **Careful Point (Hydrogenation Selectivity):** The fatal flaw is in Step 2. `H₂/Pd`, without a poisoning agent, is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), making this pathway a synthetic dead end. The numbering of the final steps is also nonsensical. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter a thorough chemical analysis, only the sequence of reagents presented in Option B provides a chemically sound and logical pathway for the entire synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. A detailed look at this name reveals a complex structure that provides crucial clues:\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a 7-carbon aldehyde.\n    *   The final product contains two cyclohexane rings and is a 14-carbon molecule.\n    *   The overall structure is an **α-hydroxy aldehyde**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Aldol Reaction.** This specific structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde formed by the dimerization of a simpler aldehyde, is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction. The key intermediate that must be synthesized first is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be planned in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires a controlled cleavage of one carbon atom from the side chain while forming an aldehyde.\n*   **Stage 2: Dimerization.** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence and Identify Fatal Flaws**\n\nWe will evaluate each option based on whether it correctly executes the two-stage strategy, paying close attention to the specific function and compatibility of the reagents.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Incorrect Hydrogenation.** The second step uses `H₂/Pd`. Without a \"poisoning\" agent (like CaCO₃), this catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane). This is a synthetic dead end, so this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by `NaNH₂` and alkylated with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. **Careful Point 3: Partial Reduction.** This is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that correctly performs a **partial reduction**, converting the alkyne into an alkene without over-reducing it. This is precisely what is needed.\n    *   **Step 3:** `O₃` followed by `(CH₃)₂S`. **Careful Point 4: Reductive Ozonolysis.** This is a reductive workup, which is essential to cleave the alkene and produce the desired **aldehyde** intermediate (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`).\n    *   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the final aldol addition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the entire logical pathway correctly.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Reagent Incompatibility.** The first step is fundamentally flawed. `NaNH₂` is an extremely strong base, and methanol is a protic solvent. The base would be neutralized in an acid-base reaction with the solvent, preventing the intended reaction with the alkyne. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point 6: Oxidative Ozonolysis.** The third step uses ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`). This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would cleave the alkene but produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only sequence B provides a chemically correct and logical pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify the starting material and the final product to understand the required transformation.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `Ethynylcyclohexane`. This is an 8-carbon molecule composed of a cyclohexane ring bonded to a terminal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a complex 14-carbon molecule. Its structure reveals it is the result of a dimerization reaction.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Aldol Reaction.** The structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde containing two identical cyclohexyl units, is the classic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction. This means the immediate precursor to the final product is two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This requires a controlled cleavage of one carbon atom.\n2.  **Dimerization:** Treat the aldehyde intermediate with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final product.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed sequence against this established two-stage strategy, identifying the key flaw in each incorrect option.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/(CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`). This is a correct and necessary first step to set up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst.\n        *   **Careful Point 2 (Partial vs. Complete Hydrogenation):** This \"poisoned\" catalyst correctly performs a partial reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. It crucially prevents over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ozonolysis (`O₃`) is followed by a workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`).\n        *   **Careful Point 3 (Reductive vs. Oxidative Ozonolysis):** This is a **reductive workup**, which is essential to cleave the alkene and obtain the required **aldehyde** intermediate (`cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`).\n    *   **Step 4:** Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is a suitable base to catalyze the final **aldol addition** reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the entire logical pathway.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 3 uses an `H₂O` workup for the ozonolysis. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would incorrectly produce a carboxylic acid (`cyclohexanecarboxylic acid`) instead of the aldehyde needed for the aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/(CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 1 is chemically invalid.\n        *   **Careful Point 4 (Reagent Incompatibility):** The extremely strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized in an immediate acid-base reaction with the protic solvent, `methanol`. This would prevent the desired deprotonation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poisoning agent. This catalyst causes **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This is a synthetic dead end. The numbering of the steps is also incoherent.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical principles and potential pitfalls, only the sequence of reagents presented in Option A provides a completely valid and logical synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **1.

This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a cyclohexane ring and a terminal alkyne functional group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde containing two cyclohexane rings, is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** To form the final 14-carbon product via a dimerization, the 8-carbon starting material must first be converted into the 7-carbon intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe transformation requires a C-C bond cleavage and must be performed in two main stages:\n1.  **Stage I: Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate.** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This involves cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain while creating an aldehyde. The most effective way to achieve this controlled cleavage is by first converting the alkyne into a specifically structured alkene, and then using ozonolysis.\n2.  **Stage II: The Aldol Reaction.** Treat the synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction, forming the final target product.\n\n### **3.
