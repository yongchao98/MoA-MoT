    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, along our line of sight. The maximum observed velocity is the semi-amplitude, denoted as $K$.\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the maximum radial velocity (semi-amplitude $K$) is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$):\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Use the Formula for RV Semi-Amplitude:**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{\\star}$ with a period $P$, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ of the star is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Establish the Relationship between Period (P) and Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    In this problem, we are given that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{\\star 1} = M_{\\star 2}$\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$\n    *   The problem implies a single deterministic answer, which means we must assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    With $M_{\\star}$, $m_p$, and $\\sin i$ being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n    We can rearrange this to express the period $P$ in terms of $K$:\n    $P^{1/3} \\propto \\frac{1}{K} \\implies P \\propto \\frac{1}{K^3}$ or $P \\propto K^{-3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the periods of planet #2 to planet #1 as:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Substituting this value into the equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To find the numerical answer, we calculate the value of the expression.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    Let's compute this value using a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    A) ~ 1.40\n    B) ~ 0.36\n    C) ~ 1.96\n    D) ~ 0.85\n\n    Our calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, is proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is $K_2/K_1 = 7/5$.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWe are given that the masses of the stars ($M_{\\star}$) and the planets ($m_p$) are the same for both systems. Assuming the orbital inclinations ($i$) are also the same, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P:\n$K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the period in terms of the semi-amplitude:\n$P \\propto K^{-3}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>"
