    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Quantities**\n\nWe need to compare two distinct energy values:\n*   **The paramagnetic coupling term `⟨H⟩`:** This is the energy shift experienced by an atomic orbital due to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n*   **The transition energy `ΔE`:** This is the energy difference between two electronic states in the Hydrogen atom, which corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during the transition.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term `⟨H⟩`**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field `B` is given by:\n`H = -μ_L ⋅ B`\nThe orbital magnetic moment `μ_L` is related to the orbital angular momentum `L` by:\n`μ_L = - (e / 2m_e) L`\nwhere `e` is the elementary charge and `m_e` is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n`H = (e / 2m_e) L ⋅ B`\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field `B` is parallel to the z-axis, so `B = (0, 0, B_z)`. The dot product becomes:\n`L ⋅ B = L_z * B_z`\n\nThe energy shift `⟨H⟩` is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. The z-component of the orbital angular momentum is quantized, with its expectation value being `⟨L_z⟩ = mħ`, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nTherefore, the energy shift is:\n`⟨H⟩ = (e / 2m_e) * (mħ) * B_z`\n\nThe term `μ_B = eħ / (2m_e)` is the **Bohr magneton**, a fundamental constant. So, the formula simplifies to:\n`⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B_z`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `B_z = 1 T`\n*   `m` is a \"small\" number. For an order-of-magnitude comparison, we can use `m = 1`.\n*   The value of the Bohr magneton is `μ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T`.\n\n`⟨H⟩ = 1 * (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T) * (1 T) = 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy `ΔE`**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n`ΔE = h * c / λ`\nwhere `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given:\n*   `λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n*   `h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s`\n\n`ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) / (0.4861 × 10⁻⁶ m) ≈ 4.088 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n\n### **4. Compare `⟨H⟩` and `ΔE`**\n\nTo compare the two energies, let's look at their values in Joules:\n*   `⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.27 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n*   `ΔE ≈ 4.09 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n\nWe can clearly see that `ΔE` is many orders of magnitude larger than `⟨H⟩`. Let's find the ratio:\n`ΔE / ⟨H⟩ = (4.088 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) / (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J) ≈ 44,000`\n\nThe transition energy is about 44,000 times larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy. This means the Zeeman splitting caused by a 1 Tesla field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy gaps between the principal electronic shells of the Hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is:\n`⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE`\n\nThis can be expressed in LaTeX as:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $$\n\nThe code below confirms the calculations.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nwavelength = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Constants\nmu_B = const.value('Bohr magneton') # Bohr magneton in J/T\nh = const.h # Planck constant in J*s\nc = const.c # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term <H>\nH_paramagnetic = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta E\nDelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength\n\n# 3. Compare the two values\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_paramagnetic:.3e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E:.3e} J\")\n\nratio = Delta_E / H_paramagnetic\nprint(f\"The ratio Delta_E / <H> is approximately {ratio:.0f}\")\nprint(\"Conclusion: <H> is much smaller than Delta E.\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
