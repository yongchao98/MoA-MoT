    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles:**\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to provide K+ and H2PO4- ions. H2PO4- is dihydrogen phosphate, a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a hydrated salt that dissociates completely in water to provide 2Na+, HPO4^2-, and water molecules. HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   Together, H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base) form a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles. This is the number of moles of H2PO4-.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles. This is the number of moles of HPO4^2-.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium:**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), which involves the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair.\n    *   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this equilibrium is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka expression directly. Using the Ka expression:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n        [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H+] = 8.106 x 10^-8 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n    *   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this equilibrium is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n    *   We use the Ka expression for this step:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can assume that the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is very small, meaning very little HPO4^2- will dissociate. We use the [H+] calculated from the buffer in the previous step.\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.106 x 10^-8 M)\n        [PO4^3-] = 6.237 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's perform the calculation with a script.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n```output\n6.24e-07\n```\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24 x 10^-7 M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and reactions:**\n    *   We have a solution containing potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   In water, KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissolves and dissociates to form 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻, and water molecules.\n    *   The species H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are a conjugate acid-base pair and form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibria for the phosphate system are:\n        *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁)\n        *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂)\n        *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃)\n    *   We are asked to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol. Since it dissociates completely, this is the number of moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol. This is the number of moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The pH of the solution is determined by the buffer system H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (Ka₂).\n    *   The equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is produced in the third dissociation step.\n    *   The equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]. We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (this is a very good approximation because Ka₃ is extremely small, so very little HPO₄²⁻ will actually dissociate).\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the provided Python script. The output `6.24e-07` corresponds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
