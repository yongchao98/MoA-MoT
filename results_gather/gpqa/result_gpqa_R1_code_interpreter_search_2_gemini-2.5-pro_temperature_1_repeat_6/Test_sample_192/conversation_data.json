    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) depends on the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This is a statement about the distribution or density of stars with respect to the parallax measurement. The most natural interpretation is that the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    \n    So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Physical Relationship:** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. For a parallax `plx` measured in arcseconds and a distance `r` in parsecs, the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r` or `r = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Connect the Variables using Calculus:** We want to find the relationship for `dN/dr` starting from the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule of differentiation to relate the two rates:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    Using the power rule, `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final relationship in terms of `r` only, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance as `r³`.\n\n9.  **Match with Options:**\n    A) ~ r⁴\n    B) ~ r³\n    C) ~ r⁵\n    D) ~ r²\n\nThe calculated relationship `~ r³` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
