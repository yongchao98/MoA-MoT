    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single stereocenter at carbon C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product(s):** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product(s):**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This results in the formation of both possible configurations (R and S) at C3.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but different configurations at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. This makes them **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is chiral, the reaction proceeds via diastereomeric transition states, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product(s):** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product(s):**\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Starting with an achiral molecule and using an achiral reagent, the overall product mixture must be achiral. This means that any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has stereocenters, but the molecule as a whole is achiral due to internal symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R)). This is a **meso compound**.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains a total of **five** different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers and will be separated. (2 peaks)\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as one peak. (1 peak)\n    *   Compound 5 is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4, so it will be separated from their peak. (1 peak)\n    *   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols) and will have different retention times.\n*   Counting the peaks: {Peak for 1} + {Peak for 2} + {Peak for 3 and 4} + {Peak for 5}.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = **4**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n*   It can separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all five distinct compounds in the mixture, assuming ideal resolution.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   Compound 1 will be separated. (1 peak)\n    *   Compound 2 (diastereomer of 1) will be separated. (1 peak)\n    *   Compound 3 will be separated. (1 peak)\n    *   Compound 4 (enantiomer of 3) will be separated from 3. (1 peak)\n    *   Compound 5 (diastereomer of 3 and 4) will be separated. (1 peak)\n*   Counting the peaks: {Peak for 1} + {Peak for 2} + {Peak for 3} + {Peak for 4} + {Peak for 5}.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
