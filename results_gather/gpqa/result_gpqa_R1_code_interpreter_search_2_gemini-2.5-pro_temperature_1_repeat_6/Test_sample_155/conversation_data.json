    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H       C3H7\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n      C3H7       H\n    ```\n    (Where C3H7 is a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3)\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-substituted epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides is formed.\n        *   Product of mCPBA step: A racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water nucleophile).\n        *   When the (4R, 5R)-epoxide reacts, the *anti*-opening leads to the formation of (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   When the (4S, 5S)-epoxide reacts, the *anti*-opening also leads to the formation of (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The product, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The final product is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\nA helpful mnemonic for this type of reaction is **\"Trans-Anti-Meso\"**: A **trans**-alkene undergoing **anti**-dihydroxylation yields a **meso** product. (The overall reaction of mCPBA followed by acid hydrolysis is an anti-dihydroxylation).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H       H\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n      C3H7       C3H7\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-substituted epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n        *   Product of mCPBA step: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane, specifically (4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** The *anti*-opening of the *meso*-epoxide proceeds with nucleophilic attack (by water) at either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C4 leads to the (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n        *   Attack at C5 leads to the (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n        *   Since the starting meso-epoxide is symmetrical, both attacks are equally probable, resulting in a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The final product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA helpful mnemonic for this reaction is **\"Cis-Anti-Racemic\"**: A **cis**-alkene undergoing **anti**-dihydroxylation yields a **racemic** product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3) (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, the *meso* compound (1) will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound, and one for the co-eluting enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three compounds in the mixture are stereoisomers, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (1), the (4R, 5R) enantiomer (2), and the (4S, 5S) enantiomer (3) will all be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for each distinct stereoisomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
