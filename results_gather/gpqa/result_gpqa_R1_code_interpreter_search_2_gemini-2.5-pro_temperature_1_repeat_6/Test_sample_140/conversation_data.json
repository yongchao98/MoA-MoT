    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide anion, NH₂⁻, is the active species) and also a potent nucleophile.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The amide anion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   The C-2 position, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   The C-6 position, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   Because of the **kinetic isotope effect**, a C-H bond is broken more easily and rapidly than a C-D bond. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both abstraction pathways, even though one is faster than the other.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C-6.\n        3.  The carbanion's lone pair attacks the adjacent C-1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻) as a leaving group.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C-2.\n        3.  The carbanion's lone pair attacks the adjacent C-1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the ring. The intermediate is simply **benzyne** (C₆H₄).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide anion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then immediately protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deutero-benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is asymmetric. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A negative charge develops on C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-6. A negative charge develops on C-1, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A leads to **two** distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is the symmetric benzyne (C₆H₄). The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (let's call them C-1 and C-2).\n        *   **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the other carbon becomes a carbanion and is protonated by NH₃. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, both attacks lead to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B leads to **one** product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find three unique organic products are formed in the reaction mixture:\n        1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n        2.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThus, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
