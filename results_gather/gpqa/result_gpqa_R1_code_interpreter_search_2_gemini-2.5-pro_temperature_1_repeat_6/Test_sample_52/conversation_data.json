    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, and the core formula of this part is C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H, which corresponds to the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring. The presence of two signals for four protons often suggests a para-substitution pattern for two different substituents.\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl proton), and the other vinyl proton would be a doublet of quartets (split by the first vinyl proton and the methyl group). This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n        *   Two signals for –CH3 groups. One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n        *   No signals for –CH2 groups. This is a critical constraint. Since we have an ester group and a second –CH3 signal, the ester must be a methyl ester (e.g., Ar-COOCH3 or Ar-OCOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) is ruled out because it contains a –CH2– group. This methyl ester fragment (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3) has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from the structural features:**\n    The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Propenyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n\n3.  **Calculate the DoU for each of the proposed chemical formulas:**\n    The formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n    *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n    *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n\n    Based on the DoU calculation, options A and C are eliminated. The correct formula must be either B (C11H12O2) or D (C12H14O2), as both have a DoU of 6.\n\n4.  **Assemble the molecular formula from the identified fragments:**\n    Let's sum the atoms of the fragments we deduced from the spectroscopic data:\n    *   Aromatic ring part: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group part: C3H5\n    *   Methyl ester part: C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Formula = (C6H4) + (C3H5) + (C2H3O2) = C(6+3+2)H(4+5+3)O2 = C11H12O2**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The formula derived from assembling the fragments that fit all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2. This formula matches option B. While option D (C12H14O2) also has the correct degree of unsaturation, it's impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that also satisfies all the other constraints (di-substituted ring, propenyl group, methyl ester, and no -CH2- groups). Adding the extra C and 2H (a CH2 unit) would violate the \"no -CH2- signals\" rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
