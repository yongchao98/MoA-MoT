    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of 7 ppm is in the alkene region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C=O). This indicates two types of carbons.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Let's check if it fits the data. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This is consistent with a single ¹H peak and two ¹³C peaks. The chemical shifts are also characteristic for maleic anhydride. Thus, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   Let's determine its formula and structure. A cyclopentadiene ring (C₅H₆) has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The formula is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄, which simplifies to C₉H₁₄. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The product's molecular formula is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically form two stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to kinetic control (stabilization from secondary orbital interactions), while the *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, so we are dealing with the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Assign NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton. Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the midpoint of the C5=C6 double bond, several groups of protons are equivalent:\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two methyl groups on the double bond (vinyl methyls, at C5 and C6) and two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n            *   The two vinyl methyl groups are equivalent: **6H singlet**. Being on a double bond, they will be downfield. Let's assign this to **~1.7 ppm**.\n            *   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent: **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be upfield. Let's assign this to **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons from maleic anhydride (at C2 and C3) are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be significantly deshielded. This is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge are not equivalent. One is *syn* to the double bond, and the other is *anti*. They would appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. The problem mentions **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer (major) and not in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Let's visualize the *endo* vs. *exo* structures:\n        *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the anhydride protons (H-anhydride at ~3.5 ppm) are brought into close proximity with the substituents on the front of the molecule, which are the vinyl methyl groups (Me-vinyl at ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOE correlation between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons is a classic diagnostic feature of the *endo* adduct.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H-anhydride):** This interaction is also possible in the *endo* isomer (specifically with the *syn*-C7 proton). However, the interaction in option C is arguably more characteristic and prominent.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-vinyl):** The relative positions of these groups are fixed in the rigid bicyclic frame and would be identical in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. An NOE between them would not distinguish the isomers.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H-anhydride):** This describes the spatial proximity between the vinyl methyl groups and the anhydride protons. As explained above, this proximity is unique to the major (*endo*) product. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-bridge):** Like option B, the distance between these protons would be the same in both isomers, so an NOE here would not be diagnostic.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product must arise from a spatial interaction unique to the *endo* geometry. The defining feature of the *endo* adduct is the proximity of the dienophile's substituents (the anhydride protons) to the diene's vinyl substituents (the vinyl methyl groups). This corresponds to an NOE between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
