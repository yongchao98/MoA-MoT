    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (δ > 9 ppm) is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that the adjacent carbon has two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This points to a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts, especially the upfield signal at 6.51 ppm, suggest the ring is attached to a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2H is typical for the protons of a primary **amino group (-NH2)**. An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a `CH2` group. The splitting, a doublet (d), means it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). This matches the `-CH2-CHO` fragment, where the `CH2` protons are split by the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **The additional DBE:** The benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs. The aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for the fifth DBE.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group), the starting material is **p-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n    Let's verify this structure with the NMR data: The -NH2 group and the -CH2CHO group are in a para position on the benzene ring. The aldehyde proton (9.72 ppm) is a triplet because it's next to the CH2 group. The CH2 protons (3.66 ppm) are a doublet because they are next to the single CHO proton. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the three-step reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** p-aminophenylacetaldehyde (`H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO`)\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    This is a **diazotization reaction**. It converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The aldehyde group remains unchanged under these mild, cold conditions.\n    *   **Product of Step 1:** p-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde (`[Cl-][+N≡N]-C6H4-CH2-CHO`)\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O, Heat**\n    This reaction involves the **hydrolysis of the diazonium salt**. The diazonium group (-N2+) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water.\n    *   **Product of Step 2:** p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (`HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting an aldehyde that has α-protons (protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is the -CH2- group in this case) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        *   Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   Condensation Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe final product is the result of the full aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration), which is driven by the application of heat.\n\n*   The structure is `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`.\n*   Numbering the chain from the aldehyde carbon as C1:\n    `C(4)H2(Ar)-C(3)H=C(2)(Ar)-C(1)HO`\n*   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The phenyl groups should be hydroxylated from step 2.\nB) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\nC) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: Correct. This is the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the complete aldol condensation reaction.\nD) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This structure does not result from an aldol dimerization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
