    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Speed of the electron, `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`.\n*   Uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m`.\n\n**2. State the relevant physical principles:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. The minimum uncertainty is given by:\n    `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between a particle's energy (E) and momentum (p) is described by `E = f(p)`. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using calculus (propagation of error):\n    `ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp`\n    The derivative `dE/dp` represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity `v`. This holds true for both relativistic (`E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`) and non-relativistic (`E = p²/2m₀`) cases.\n    Therefore, we can use the simple relation:\n    `ΔE ≈ v * Δp`\n\n**3. Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for minimum uncertainty:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    Substitute the expression for `Δp` into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n    `ΔE = v * Δp = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))`\n\n*   **Step 3: Substitute the numerical values and compute.**\n    I will use a Python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\nv = 2e8  # Speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # Uncertainty in position in m\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_x * delta_p >= h_bar / 2\n# For minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# The relationship between energy and momentum uncertainty is delta_E ≈ v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e} J\")\n```\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately `1.055 * 10^-16 J`.\n\n**4. Compare the result with the given options:**\n*   A) ~10^(-16) J\n*   B) ~10^(-18) J\n*   C) ~10^(-19) J\n*   D) ~10^(-17) J\n\nOur calculated value, `1.055 * 10^-16 J`, is approximately `10^-16 J`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Principles:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For position (x) and momentum (p), the principle is mathematically expressed as:\n    `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`\n    where:\n    *   `Δx` is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   `Δp` is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`).\n    The minimum possible uncertainty is when `Δx * Δp = ħ / 2`.\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation:** The uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). For a particle moving with velocity `v`, this relationship is given by:\n    `ΔE ≈ v * Δp`\n    This relation is derived from the energy-momentum equation (`E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²` for relativistic particles or `E = p²/(2m)` for non-relativistic particles) by considering small changes, where `dE/dp = v`.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    From the uncertainty principle, we can find the minimum `Δp`:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute `Δp` into the energy uncertainty relation.**\n    `ΔE = v * Δp = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))`\n\n*   **Step 3: Plug in the given values.**\n    *   `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`\n    *   `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m`\n    *   `ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10^-34 J·s`\n\n    `ΔE ≈ (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (1.054 * 10^-34 J·s) / (2 * 10^-10 m)`\n    `ΔE ≈ (1.054 * 10^-34) * (2 * 10^8) / (2 * 10^-10) J`\n    `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^(-34 + 8 + 10) J`\n    `ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^-16 J`\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately `1.055 * 10^-16 J`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) ~10^(-16) J\n*   B) ~10^(-18) J\n*   C) ~10^(-19) J\n*   D) ~10^(-17) J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to `10^-16 J`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
