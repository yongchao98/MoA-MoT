    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\nCompound A has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals:\n1.  A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet (3 peaks) indicates 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). The 6H integration suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH3). So, we have two CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. This points towards two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n2.  A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet (4 peaks) indicates 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). The 4H integration suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH2-). So, we have two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a CH3 group. This also points towards two ethyl groups.\n\nA molecule with two equivalent ethyl groups and high symmetry that gives only two signals is butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). The two outer CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two inner CH2 groups are equivalent. The CH3 signal is a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2), and the CH2 signal is a quartet (split by the adjacent CH3).\nTherefore, **Compound A is butane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\nCompound A (butane) undergoes monobromination to form compound B. The bromination of an alkane is a free-radical substitution. Substitution can occur at a primary carbon (C1) or a secondary carbon (C2). Radical stability follows the order tertiary > secondary > primary. Thus, substitution at the secondary carbon (C2) is favored.\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2 --(hÎ½)--> CH3-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3 + HBr\nTherefore, **Compound B is 2-bromobutane**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction (E2 elimination). The base (OH-) removes a proton from a carbon adjacent (beta) to the carbon bearing the bromine. There are two types of beta-protons in 2-bromobutane: on C1 and C3.\n*   Elimination of H from C1 gives but-1-ene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3).\n*   Elimination of H from C3 gives but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n\nAccording to Zaitsev's rule, the elimination reaction favors the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene. But-2-ene is disubstituted, while but-1-ene is monosubstituted. Thus, but-2-ene is the major product.\nThe problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene. This confirms that **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D from the Diels-Alder Reaction**\nThe *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, specifically a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene. The two methyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n*   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. The name is non-standard, but it describes the molecule HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3. The diene system is C1-C4 of a butadiene core. The substituents on the diene are an -OH group at C1 and a -CH3 group at C4. The (1E, 3E) stereochemistry means that in the s-cis conformation required for the reaction, both the -OH group (on C1) and the -CH3 group (on C4) are in \"outer\" positions.\n\n**Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Product:**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction has specific stereochemical rules:\n1.  **Dienophile stereochemistry is retained:** Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups attached to the former double bond will be *cis* to each other in the cyclohexene product.\n2.  **Diene stereochemistry determines product stereochemistry:** The two \"outer\" groups of the diene ((E,E)-diene) will end up *cis* to each other in the product. Here, the outer groups are -OH and -CH3. So, the -OH group and the diene's -CH3 group will be *cis* to each other.\n3.  **Endo Rule:** The reaction proceeds preferentially via an *endo* transition state. This means the substituents of the dienophile (the two methyl groups) are oriented *trans* to the \"outer\" substituents of the diene (-OH and -CH3).\n\n**Summary of relative stereochemistry in Compound D:**\n*   The product is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group at C1, and methyl groups at C4, C5, and C6 (using reaction-based numbering, which corresponds to IUPAC numbering for cyclohex-2-enol). The name is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n*   The -OH group (at C1) and the -CH3 group at C4 are **cis**.\n*   The -CH3 group at C5 and the -CH3 group at C6 are **cis**.\n*   The pair {-OH, -CH3 at C4} is **trans** to the pair {-CH3 at C5, -CH3 at C6}.\n\n**Assigning R/S Configuration:**\nLet's determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for the enantiomer that matches the options. Let's assume the {-OH, -CH3 at C4} pair is \"down\" (dashed bonds) and the {-CH3 at C5, -CH3 at C6} pair is \"up\" (wedged bonds).\n\n*   **C1:** Priories: OH > C2 > C6 > H. The OH is down, H is up. The path 1(OH) -> 2(C2) -> 3(C6) is clockwise. Since H is up (front), we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) -> **S**.\n*   **C4:** Priorities: C5 > C3 > CH3 > H. The CH3 is down, H is up. The path 1(C5) -> 2(C3) -> 3(CH3) is counter-clockwise. Since H is up (front), we reverse the result. Counter-clockwise (S) -> **R**.\n*   **C5:** Priorities: C6 > C4 > CH3 > H. The CH3 is up, H is down. The path 1(C6) -> 2(C4) -> 3(CH3) is counter-clockwise. Since H is down (back), the result is **S**.\n*   **C6:** Priorities: C1 > C5 > CH3 > H. The CH3 is up, H is down. The path 1(C1) -> 2(C5) -> 3(CH3) is clockwise. Since H is down (back), the result is **R**.\n\nThe resulting absolute configuration for this enantiomer is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**. This matches option B.\n\nFinal Product D: **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**\n\n<<<B>>>"
