    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Principle:** The density of a planet depends on two main factors: its composition (what it's made of) and the compression of that material due to its own gravity. For planets with the *same* composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the materials more, leading to a higher overall density. Conversely, a less massive planet will have weaker gravity and thus lower density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Option (a):** This describes a planet that is essentially a twin of Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³).\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n3.  **Evaluate Option (b):** This planet's density is given directly.\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Option (c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. According to the principle outlined in step 1, because it is much more massive, its self-gravity will be much stronger, compressing its material to a state that is significantly denser than Earth's.\n    *   Density (c) > Density of Earth (5.51 g/cm³).\n    *   Using the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets (where Radius ∝ Mass^~0.25), the density scales with mass (Density ∝ Mass^~0.25). A 5-Earth-mass planet would be roughly 5^(0.25) ≈ 1.5 times denser than Earth, resulting in a density of approximately 8.2 g/cm³.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Option (d):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive. Due to its lower mass, its self-gravity is weaker. This results in less compression of its material compared to Earth. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n    *   Density (d) < Density of Earth (5.51 g/cm³).\n    *   Using the same scaling as above, its density would be roughly 0.5^(0.25) ≈ 0.84 times that of Earth, or about 4.6 g/cm³.\n\n6.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) is significantly > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (d) is < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n**Conclusion:** The planet described in option (c) has the highest mass for a given composition, leading to the greatest gravitational compression and therefore the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
