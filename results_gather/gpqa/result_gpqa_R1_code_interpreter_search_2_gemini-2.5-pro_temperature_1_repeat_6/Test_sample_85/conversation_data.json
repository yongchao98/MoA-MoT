    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, which is characteristic of a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\nLet's identify the precursor hydroxy acid that would cyclize to form this lactone.\n- A δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n- The lactone is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The numbering of the heterocyclic ring starts with O=1, C=O is C2, and so on. The ethyl group is at position C4.\n- The open-chain precursor would be a pentanoic acid. The stereocenter with the ethyl group in the acid chain (at C3) becomes the stereocenter at C4 in the lactone ring.\n- The precursor acid is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n- The stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained during cyclization. So, (R)-lactone comes from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, and (S)-lactone comes from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name.\n- It's a derivative of pentanoic acid with a stereocenter at C3 containing an ethyl group.\n- The name suggests it's a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), which is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n- The term \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" indicates that the carboxylic acid group at the C5 position has been converted into an isobutyl ester.\n- Therefore, the starting material is the half-ester: **HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl**.\n- This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl).\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Goal:** To form the (R)-lactone, the intermediate must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** To get this intermediate from the starting half-ester, the **ester group must be reduced** to a primary alcohol (`-COO-iBu → -CH2OH`), while the carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is known to reduce esters but reacts very slowly with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it selectively reduces the ester in the presence of the acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `A` (the half-ester) reacts with LiBH₄.\n    2.  The ester group is reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  Acid workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) to form the δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the C5 carbonyl group, which is not the chiral center (C3). Thus, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Goal:** To form the (S)-lactone, the intermediate must be (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** Similar to reaction 1, this requires the **ester group to be reduced** while the carboxylic acid group is preserved.\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is known to be highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids over esters in *intermolecular* reactions. This presents a potential contradiction.\n*   **Mechanism - A Deeper Look:**\n    1.  Borane (BH₃) is a Lewis acid and reacts very rapidly with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid group to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (`-COO-BH₂`).\n    2.  This intermediate can then act as an *intramolecular* reducing agent. The borohydride complexed at the acid end can deliver a hydride to the ester carbonyl at the other end of the molecule. This requires the molecule to fold back on itself to form a cyclic transition state (a 7-membered ring in this case, which is favorable).\n    3.  This intramolecular pathway leads to the reduction of the ester, even though BH₃ typically prefers carboxylic acids in intermolecular competition.\n    4.  The intermediate formed after this intramolecular reduction and hydrolysis is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    5.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization to the δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction, although mechanistically different, still occurs at the C5 carbonyl group and does not affect the chiral center at C3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
