    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all these complexes.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n2.  **Use Stability Constants:**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β values):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Complex:**\n    We want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`. This is the mole fraction of this species, denoted as `α2`, multiplied by 100.\n    `Percentage = ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100`\n\n    We can express `c(Co)` in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    The fraction `α2` is then:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    The problem provides the necessary values:\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` (The notation `[X]` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of species X. Thus, we assume 0.1 M is the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium).\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for calculating the percentage, as it cancels out from the fraction.\n\n5.  **Calculate:**\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator of the `α2` formula:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)2]`:\n    `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, we can find the fraction `α2`:\n    `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    To get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is very close to 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Free thiocyanate concentration\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # in M\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex (alpha_2) is:\n# alpha_2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*SCN_conc + beta2*SCN_conc**2 + beta3*SCN_conc**3 + beta4*SCN_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the fraction\nnumerator = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species.

Express complex concentrations using stability constants (β):**\nThe overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion and ligand concentrations:\n*   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**4. Formulate the fraction of the desired complex:**\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, denoted as `α2`, is given by:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]` from the denominator and cancel it with the numerator:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`, is not needed for this calculation.\n\n**5. Substitute the given values and calculate:**\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n`Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nCalculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to percentage:**\n`Percentage = α2 * 100 ≈ 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis result matches the value from the code execution (`16.91618...%`).
