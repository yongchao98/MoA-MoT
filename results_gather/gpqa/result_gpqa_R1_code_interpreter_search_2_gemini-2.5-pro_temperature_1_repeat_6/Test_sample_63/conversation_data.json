    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gaseous products.**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B, when heated, decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and we are given the change in mass of these tubes.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, SO₃, NO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with a dehydrating agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This indicates it's a relatively inert gas. The most common such gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Verify the composition of the products.**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × (2 × 14.01 g/mol) = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), which confirms that our identification of the products and their quantities is correct. The products of the decomposition are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elemental formula of the salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B. We can calculate the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Each H₂O molecule has 2 H atoms.\n    Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n    Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** O is in both H₂O and O₂.\n    Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar, meaning it contained `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\nThe fact that the salts decompose completely into gases strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n\nThe total elemental ratio in the combined (A+B) unit is H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get an integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nH:N:O = 8 : 4 : 5.\nThis means that the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B is H₈N₄O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common, plausible salts (A and B) that add up to this combined formula. Let's try the most common ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → formula H₄N₂O₂\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → formula H₄N₂O₃\n\nLet's check if their sum matches our derived combined formula:\n(H₄N₂O₂) + (H₄N₂O₃) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis is a perfect match. So, we can confidently identify:\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa)\n\nLet's quickly verify this with the given mass and molar amounts.\n*   M(NH₄NO₂) = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   M(NH₄NO₃) = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Mass of `n` moles of A + `n` moles of B = `n` × (64.06 + 80.06) = `n` × 144.12 g/mol.\n*   `n` × 144.12 = 7.20 g → `n` = 7.20 / 144.12 ≈ 0.05 mol.\n\nThis is consistent with all the information. The decomposition reactions would be:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\nCombining the products from 0.05 mol of each salt correctly yields the amounts calculated in Step 1.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
