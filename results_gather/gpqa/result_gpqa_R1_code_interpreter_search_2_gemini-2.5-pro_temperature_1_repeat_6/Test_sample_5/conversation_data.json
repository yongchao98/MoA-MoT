    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a quantum mechanical particle of mass *m* moving in a two-dimensional potential $V(r, \\theta)$ and we need to find its energy spectrum. The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nThe energy spectrum corresponds to the eigenvalues of the time-independent Schrödinger equation, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, where H is the Hamiltonian operator.\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential has a complicated dependence on both *r* and *θ*. Solving the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates with this potential would be difficult. However, the form of the potential suggests that it might simplify in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$.\n\nThe conversion relations between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n*   $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n*   $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nFrom these, we can see that $x^2 = r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$. We can substitute $r^2$ and $r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$ into the potential expression:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k(x^2)$\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n**3. Analyze the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a particle in two dimensions is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}) + V(x, y)$\n\nSubstituting the potential we found in Cartesian coordinates:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}) + 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\nThis Hamiltonian is separable, meaning it can be written as the sum of two independent Hamiltonians, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\n$H = H_x + H_y$\nwhere:\n*   $H_x = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + 2kx^2$\n*   $H_y = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n**4. Solve for the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nSince the Hamiltonian is a sum of two independent parts, the total energy eigenvalue E is the sum of the eigenvalues of $H_x$ and $H_y$:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n\nBoth $H_x$ and $H_y$ are the Hamiltonians for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The standard form for a 1D QHO potential is $\\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 q^2$, and its energy eigenvalues are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. We equate this to the standard form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} m\\omega_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2$\n    $\\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m} \\implies \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-component are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$. We equate this to the standard form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} m\\omega_y^2 y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n    $\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-component are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy is the sum $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$:\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nNow, factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = [2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2}] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$.\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
