    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula.\n    *   \"cyclohex-3-ene\": This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n    *   \"carboxylic acid\": This is a -COOH group. By IUPAC convention, the carbon of this group is C1.\n    *   \"2-formyl\": This is a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached to C2 of the ring.\n    *   \"5-vinyl\": This is a -CH=CH2 group attached to C5 of the ring.\n\n    Let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):**\n        *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):**\n        *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n        *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   Let's find the formula for the parent structure: C10H?O3. A fully saturated, acyclic molecule with 10 carbons would be C10H22 (CnH2n+2).\n        *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can be calculated from the structural features:\n            *   One ring: IHD = 1\n            *   One double bond in the ring (cyclohex-3-ene): IHD = 1\n            *   One double bond in the vinyl group (C=C): IHD = 1\n            *   One double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O): IHD = 1\n            *   One double bond in the formyl group (C=O): IHD = 1\n        *   Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Now we can find the number of hydrogens in the reactant (C10HxO3) using the IHD formula:\n        *   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        *   5 = 10 + 1 - (H/2)\n        *   5 = 11 - H/2\n        *   H/2 = 11 - 5 = 6\n        *   H = 12.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reagents are red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds (double/triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n    *   Specifically:\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Product**\n    *   The reaction starts with a C10 molecule and involves reduction, so the number of carbon atoms will not change. The product will also have 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction.\n    *   All double bonds (C=C and C=O) are converted to single bonds.\n    *   The initial structure had one ring. This ring structure remains, but the double bond within it is saturated.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n    *   The product has 10 carbon atoms (C10).\n    *   It is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n    *   For our product, where n = 10, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also called the degree of unsaturation) tells you the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Using the product's formula, C10H20:\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10\n    *   IHD = 1\n    *   This IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring (the cyclohexane core) present in the final product molecule, which is fully saturated otherwise.\n\n<<<A>>>"
