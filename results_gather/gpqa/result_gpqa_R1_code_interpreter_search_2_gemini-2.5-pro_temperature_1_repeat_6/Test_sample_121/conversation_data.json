    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction selectively brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** The α-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. Bromination of this carbon yields α-bromoacetic acid.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol to form ethyl bromoacetate.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on this carbon (the CH2 group between the CN and COOEt groups) are acidic because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile and the carbonyl groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbon of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. Since two equivalents of the carbanion can be formed (using excess NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane has two leaving groups, a double alkylation occurs. Two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate will react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n        2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 Br⁻\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n    CN                                     CN\n    |                                      |\n    CH3CH2OOC-CH-(CH2)-(CH2)-(CH2)-(CH2)-(CH2)-CH-COOCH2CH3\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Symmetry and Stereochemistry:** The final product has two identical stereocenters at the α-carbons. The reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers: an enantiomeric pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). The question asks for the number of observable signals. Typically, in such problems where multiple diastereomers are formed and the options are single integers, we analyze the symmetry of one of the diastereomers. Since 8 is an option and the number of signals for the meso form (9) is not, we will analyze the spectrum for the (R,R) or (S,S) enantiomer.\n*   **Analysis of the (R,R)/(S,S) enantiomeric pair:** This molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group of the pentamethylene chain. This symmetry makes the two halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the non-equivalent proton environments:\n1.  **Ethyl groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry.\n    *   The protons of the two **CH3** groups are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The protons of the two **OCH2** groups are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n2.  **Alpha-protons (-CH(CN)):** The two α-protons are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n3.  **Pentamethylene chain (-(CH2)5-):** We need to consider the effect of the adjacent stereocenter (diastereotopicity). Let's label the chain carbons starting from an α-carbon: -CHα-(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-CHα'-. Due to C2 symmetry, a is equivalent to a', and b is equivalent to b'.\n    *   **Protons on CH2(a):** This methylene group is adjacent to a stereocenter. Therefore, its two protons are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. They will appear as two distinct signals (each likely a complex multiplet). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on CH2(b):** This methylene group is also in a chiral molecule. Its two protons are also diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on CH2(c):** This is the central methylene group. The C2 axis of symmetry passes through the carbon atom and interchanges the two protons. Protons that are interchangeable by a rotation axis are called enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From ethyl groups: 2\n    *   From α-protons: 1\n    *   From pentamethylene chain: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5\n    *   **Total = 2 + 1 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of the (R,R)/(S,S) enantiomeric pair will show 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
