    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\nb) The total energy (E) of the system.\n\n**2. Given Information**\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Rest mass (m₁): 2m\n    *   Velocity (v₁): 0.6c in the positive x-direction\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Rest mass (m₂): 3m\n    *   Velocity (v₂): 0.5c in the positive x-direction\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\nSince the velocities are relativistic, we cannot simply subtract them (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity. For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nLet's substitute the given values:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Energy (E)**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut. The total energy (E) of a single particle with rest mass m₀ moving at speed v is given by the formula:\n\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\n\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n    *   m₁ = 2m\n    *   v₁ = 0.6c\n    *   First, calculate γ₁:\n        γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n    *   Now, calculate E₁:\n        E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n    *   m₂ = 3m\n    *   v₂ = 0.5c\n    *   First, calculate γ₂:\n        γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3\n    *   Now, calculate E₂:\n        E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c² = (6 / √3) mc² = 2√3 mc²\n    *   Using the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        E₂ ≈ 2 * 1.732 * mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n*   **Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n    *   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n    *   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\n    *   E_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²\n    *   E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\n    *   E_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96 mc²\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
