    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star goes from having no spots to having spots. This factor is `Ratio(no spots) / Ratio(with spots)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The **Boltzmann equation** governs the distribution of atoms among different energy levels.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `n_j` in a higher energy state `E_j` to the number of atoms `n_i` in a lower energy state `E_i` is given by:\n    `n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Ratio and Temperatures:**\n    *   The problem provides the temperatures for the two scenarios:\n        *   `T_nospot` = 6000 K (the effective temperature when the surface is clear).\n        *   `T_withspot` = 5500 K (the *overall* effective temperature when 40% of the surface is covered by spots). We will use this effective temperature as the characteristic temperature for the line-forming region in the spotted case.\n    *   The problem states that the ratio \"decreases when the star has spots\". Since the temperature decreases when spots appear (`T_withspot` < `T_nospot`), the ratio must be a function that decreases with temperature.\n    *   Let's check the two possible ratios from the Boltzmann equation:\n        *   Ratio 1: `n_higher / n_lower = C * exp(-ΔE / kT)`. As `T` decreases, `-ΔE/kT` becomes more negative, so the exponential term decreases. This matches the observation.\n        *   Ratio 2: `n_lower / n_higher = C' * exp(+ΔE / kT)`. As `T` decreases, `+ΔE/kT` increases, so the exponential term increases. This contradicts the observation.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio mentioned in the problem, let's call it `Q`, must be `n_higher / n_lower`.\n\n5.  **Set up the Factor Calculation:** We need to calculate the factor `F = Q_nospot / Q_withspot`.\n    *   `Q_nospot = (g_higher / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))`\n    *   `Q_withspot = (g_higher / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n    *   `F = Q_nospot / Q_withspot = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n    *   Using the property `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n        `F = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)] )`\n        `F = exp( (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_withspot) )`\n        `F = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot) )`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10^-10` meters.\n    *   `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Combine and Compute:** We can now substitute the expression for `ΔE` into our factor equation and plug in the values.\n    *   `F = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot) )`\n    *   The values are:\n        *   `T_nospot = 6000` K\n        *   `T_withspot = 5500` K\n        *   `λ = 1448 * 10^-10` m\n        *   `h ≈ 6.626 * 10^-34` J·s\n        *   `c ≈ 3 * 10^8` m/s\n        *   `k ≈ 1.38 * 10^-23` J/K\n\n    To get an accurate result, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values\nwavelength_A = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_nospot = 6000  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_withspot = 5500  # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Convert wavelength to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the term (Delta_E / k)\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (wavelength_m * k)\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the factor\n# Factor = exp( (delta_E / k) * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot) )\nexponent = delta_E_over_k * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.51\n<<<\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.51, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots compared to when it does not. We are given the temperatures for both states and the wavelength of the transition between the energy levels. The key physical principle governing the population of energy levels in a star's photosphere, assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, `i` and `j`:\n\n`n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n_j` and `n_i` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state `j` and lower energy state `i`, respectively.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`~1.38 x 10^-23` J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Since the temperature is lower when spots are present (`T_withspot` < `T_nospot`), the ratio in question must be `n_higher / n_lower`, as the exponential term `exp(-ΔE / kT)` decreases with decreasing temperature.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Factor Calculation\n\nLet `R` be the ratio `n_higher / n_lower`. We need to find the factor `F = R_nospot / R_withspot`.\n\n*   Ratio without spots (`T_nospot = 6000 K`):\n    `R_nospot = (g_higher / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))`\n\n*   Ratio with spots (`T_withspot = 5500 K`):\n    `R_withspot = (g_higher / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n\nThe factor `F` is the division of these two ratios:\n\n`F = R_nospot / R_withspot = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))]`\n\nUsing the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n\n`F = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)] )`\n`F = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot) )`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n\n`ΔE = h * c / λ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is the Planck constant (`~6.626 x 10^-34` J·s).\n*   `c` is the speed of light (`~3.0 x 10^8` m/s).\n*   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10` m.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nWe can substitute the expression for `ΔE` into our equation for the factor `F` and plug in the known values.\n\n`F = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot) )`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   `h*c / k` ≈ `(6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.38e-23` ≈ `0.01438` m·K\n*   `λ = 1448e-10` m\n*   `T_withspot = 5500` K\n*   `T_nospot = 6000` K\n\nThe calculation was performed using the provided Python script, which yielded the result:\n\n`Factor ≈ 4.51`\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
