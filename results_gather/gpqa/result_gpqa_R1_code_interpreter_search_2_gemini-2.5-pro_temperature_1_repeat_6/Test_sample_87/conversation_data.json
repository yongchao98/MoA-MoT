    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (tagged with GFP).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches. These are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, crucial for initiating mucosal immunity.\n    *   **Cell Population:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. Cell proliferation is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, specifically clonal expansion of lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) that have recognized an antigen.\n    *   **Molecular Analysis:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene from these proliferating cells.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"high variability\" in the sequenced variable heavy chain genes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Immunological Context:**\n    *   The experiment describes an adaptive immune response occurring in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) following antigen exposure.\n    *   The focus is on the \"variable heavy chain gene,\" which is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibody it will secrete. Therefore, the proliferating cells are most likely B cells undergoing activation and differentiation in a germinal center within the Peyer's patch.\n    *   The question is, what process causes \"high variability\" in the variable region of the heavy chain gene *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ?\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate and adaptive humoral immune response involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve genetic changes to B cell genes.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from Cμ for IgM to Cγ for IgG or Cα for IgA). While it happens in the same location and cell type, it does not affect the *variable* region, so it doesn't account for the observed variability there.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. It intentionally introduces random point mutations into the DNA encoding the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and differentiate, a process called affinity maturation. This process directly causes \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene. This perfectly matches the experimental findings.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the vast diversity of B cell receptors. However, it occurs in the *primary* lymphoid organ (bone marrow) during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter any antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to an antigen.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
