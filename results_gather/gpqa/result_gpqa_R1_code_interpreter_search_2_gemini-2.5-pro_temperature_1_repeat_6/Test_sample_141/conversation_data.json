    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space.\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix and Bloch Sphere Representation:**\n    A general density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be represented as a point within or on a 3D sphere called the Bloch sphere. This representation is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where:\n    *   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n        *   $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The length of the Bloch vector $|\\vec{r}|$ determines whether the state is pure ($|\\vec{r}|=1$, on the surface of the sphere) or mixed ($|\\vec{r}|<1$, inside the sphere). The case $|\\vec{r}|>1$ is unphysical.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Density Matrix:**\n    The density matrix is given as:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n    In the standard computational basis, the states are represented as:\n    $\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The outer products are:\n    $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The sum of these two projectors is the identity matrix:\n    $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n    Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    This is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\n3.  **Determine the Bloch Vector:**\n    We can find the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ using the formula $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$.\n    Let's calculate each component:\n    *   **$r_x$**:\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x)$\n        $r_x = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   **$r_y$**:\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y)$\n        $r_y = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   **$r_z$**:\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z)$\n        $r_z = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n\n    Alternatively, by comparing $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ with the general form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, we can see that the term $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ must be the zero matrix. This is only possible if $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) r=(0,0,1)\n    B) r=(1,1,0)\n    C) r=(0,0,0)\n    D) r=(1,1,1)\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
