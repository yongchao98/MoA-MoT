    "This problem requires us to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Transit Probability Formula**\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n`Probability (P_transit) = R_s / a`\n\nWe need to calculate this probability for each planet:\n*   `P_transit1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n*   `P_transit2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n\n**2. Use the Given Information**\n\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n*   The mass of Star_1 is twice that of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n*   The radius of Star_1 is the same as Star_2: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n\n**3. Relate the Semi-Major Axes using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nTo compare the transit probabilities, we first need to find the relationship between the semi-major axes, `a_1` and `a_2`. We can use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\n\n`P^2 / a^3 = 4π² / (G * M_s)`\n\nwhere `P` is the orbital period, `a` is the semi-major axis, `M_s` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nRearranging for `a`, we get:\n`a³ = (G * M_s * P²) / 4π²`\nThis shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes `a_1 / a_2`:\n`(a_1 / a_2) = [ (M_s1 * P_1²) / (M_s2 * P_2²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the given relationships (`M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P_1 = P_2 / 3`):\n`(a_1 / a_2) = [ (2 * M_s2 * (P_2 / 3)²) / (M_s2 * P_2²) ]^(1/3)`\n`(a_1 / a_2) = [ (2 * M_s2 * P_2² / 9) / (M_s2 * P_2²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `M_s2` and `P_2²` terms cancel out:\n`(a_1 / a_2) = (2 / 9)^(1/3)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Transit Probabilities**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the transit probabilities:\n`Ratio = P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nSince we know `R_s1 = R_s2`, the stellar radii cancel out:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1 = 1 / (a_1 / a_2)`\n\nSubstitute the value we found for `a_1 / a_2`:\n`Ratio = 1 / (2 / 9)^(1/3) = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can compute the cube root of 4.5.\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n1.650964013141185\n```\nThe calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means that `P_transit1 / P_transit2 ≈ 1.65`, or `P_transit1 ≈ 1.65 * P_transit2`.\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a probability of transiting that is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. The researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis, `P_transit = R_s / a`. We need to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\nLet's denote the parameters for Planet_1 and its host star with subscript 1, and those for Planet_2 with subscript 2.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `T_1 = T_2 / 3`.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n`Ratio = P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nSince `R_s1 = R_s2`, the stellar radii cancel out:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (`T`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`), and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (`M_s`):\n`T² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n`a³ ∝ T² * M_s`\n`a ∝ (T² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_1 / a_2`:\n`a_1 / a_2 = [ (T_1² * M_s1) / (T_2² * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the given relationships (`T_1 = T_2 / 3` and `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`):\n`a_1 / a_2 = [ ((T_2 / 3)² * (2 * M_s2)) / (T_2² * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_1 / a_2 = [ (T_2² / 9 * 2 * M_s2) / (T_2² * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `T_2²` and `M_s2` terms cancel out:\n`a_1 / a_2 = (2 / 9)^(1/3)`\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of this:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1 = 1 / (2 / 9)^(1/3) = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nUsing the provided code output, the value of this ratio is:\n`Ratio ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
