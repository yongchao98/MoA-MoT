    "Here is a breakdown of the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\n1.  **Identify the initial conditions:** We start with 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n2.  **Account for dilution:** This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n3.  **Calculate the new concentration:** The total volume becomes 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid.\n    *   (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 × 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n    *   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution we are titrating is **0.025 M**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Understand the state at 25% titration:** At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains a mixture of the remaining weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its newly formed conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). This is a buffer solution.\n2.  **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using this equation:\n    *   pH = pKₐ + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    *   Where pKₐ = -log(Kₐ), [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n3.  **Calculate pKₐ:**\n    *   Kₐ = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKₐ = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n4.  **Determine the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to base, and 75% remains as acid.\n    *   Ratio = [A⁻] / [HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n5.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKₐ + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = pKₐ - log(3)\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Understand the state at the equivalence point:** At this point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), in water.\n2.  **Calculate the moles of acetate:** First, find the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles HA = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles.\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acetate (A⁻) = 0.001 moles.\n3.  **Calculate the total volume:** We need the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Moles HA = Moles NaOH = 0.001 moles\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL.\n    *   Total Volume = Initial acid volume + Volume NaOH added = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.050 L.\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻]:**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n5.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the acetate ion:** The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n6.  **Calculate K_b:** We need the base dissociation constant (K_b) for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kₐ × K_b = K_w (where K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n    *   K_b = K_w / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n7.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:** For the weak base hydrolysis, we can set up an equilibrium expression: K_b = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Assuming [CH₃COOH] = [OH⁻] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M.\n    *   K_b = x² / 0.02\n    *   Solve for x, which is the [OH⁻].\n8.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05  # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 20.00  # cm3\nadded_water_vol = 20.00  # cm3\nnaoh_conc = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Part 1: Dilution ---\nfinal_acid_vol = initial_acid_vol + added_water_vol\n# M1V1 = M2V2 -> M2 = (M1*V1)/V2\ndiluted_acid_conc = (initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol) / final_acid_vol\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Part 3: pH at Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis) ---\n# Moles of acid in the diluted solution\nmoles_acid = diluted_acid_conc * (final_acid_vol / 1000)\n\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point\n# M_acid * V_acid = M_base * V_base -> V_base = (M_acid * V_acid) / M_base\n# Note: M_acid * V_acid is simply moles_acid\nvol_naoh_equiv_L = moles_acid / naoh_conc\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv_L = (final_acid_vol / 1000) + vol_naoh_equiv_L\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_vol_equiv_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = x^2 / [A-], where x = [OH-]\n# x = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_equiv = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\n\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = 4.26\n*   pH at the equivalence point = 8.52\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step breakdown of the titration calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid.\n    M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    So, the titration is performed on a 0.025 M acetic acid solution.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), and 75% remains as the acid. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKₐ + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   First, calculate the pKₐ from the given Kₐ:\n    pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaA). The solution now contains only the conjugate base (A⁻), which will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    Moles HA = M₂ × V₂ = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At the equivalence point, we have 0.001 mol of acetate (A⁻).\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Initial diluted volume + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at this point:\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, K_b.\n    K_b = K_w / Kₐ = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis to find [OH⁻]: K_b = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(K_b × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
