    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and stable C2 substituent containing a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits: An acetyl group has 2 carbons and one C=O group. This works perfectly.\n*   The overall structure is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group. This is a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   The molecular formula is C8H7XO. The number of protons is 4 on the ring and 3 in the methyl group, for a total of **7 protons**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe problem asks for a specific NMR spectrum from the options, which often correspond to a highly symmetric isomer. Let's consider the *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which is the most symmetric arrangement.\n\n*   **Structure:** *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This means there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (Ha).\n    *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group (Hb).\n*   **Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH3) are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The aromatic protons Ha are only coupled to the adjacent Hb protons. They will appear as a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The aromatic protons Hb are only coupled to the adjacent Ha protons. They will also appear as a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) should therefore show two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum Summary for *p*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   Aromatic region: A 2H doublet and another 2H doublet.\n    *   Aliphatic region: A 3H singlet.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum does not match our prediction. It has only one aromatic proton and several signals in the 4-5 ppm range, which is incorrect. The proton count (1+2+2+2 = 7H) is correct, but the pattern is wrong.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is exactly the \"two doublets, each for 2H\" pattern we predicted for a para-substituted ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet for 3 protons, perfectly matching the acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is an excellent match for *p*-haloacetophenone. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their shifts downfield to 7.6-7.8 ppm, which is chemically reasonable.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the aromatic region (above 6.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to a different isomer that also fits the initial description: *p*-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (Ar-CH2CHO).\n    *   This structure has 8 carbons, a C=O (aldehyde), and an Ar-X bond.\n    *   It would show an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), a -CH2- group, and a para-substituted ring.\n    *   **However, the chemical shifts for the aromatic protons (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are incorrect for this structure.** The -CH2CHO group is only weakly electron-withdrawing, and the aromatic protons would appear much further upfield (at a lower ppm), typically around 7.2-7.3 ppm. The shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm indicate strong deshielding, which is caused by a group like -COCH3 being directly attached to the ring. Therefore, this option is chemically inconsistent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given description (p-haloacetophenone) is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
