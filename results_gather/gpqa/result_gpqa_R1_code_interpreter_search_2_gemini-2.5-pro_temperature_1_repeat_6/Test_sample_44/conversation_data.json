    "*   **1. System Analysis:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`.\n    *   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down). This means that for each spatial energy level `n`, there are two distinct spin states. Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n    *   **Energy Levels:** The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n        where `n` is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a unit of energy E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2). So, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\n        E_n = n^2 * E\n        *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = E\n        *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n        *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n        *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n        *   and so on.\n\n*   **2. Ground State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   To find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we must fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   We have 4 particles to place.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1 (E_1 = E). We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2 (E_2 = 4E). We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n    *   E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n*   **3. First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    *   E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n*   **4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n    *   Let's list the energies of the possible configurations with low excitation energies:\n        *   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n        *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = 2*E + 4E + 9E = 15E. (This is the First Excited State).\n        *   **Excitation B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = 1*E + 2*4E + 1*9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n        *   **Excitation C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = 2*E + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n            *   Energy = 2*E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
