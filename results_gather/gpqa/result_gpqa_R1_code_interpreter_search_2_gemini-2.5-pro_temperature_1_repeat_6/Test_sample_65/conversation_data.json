    "The user is asking about the fundamental symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model (SM) is a relativistic quantum field theory, meaning it is fundamentally based on the principles of special relativity. Lorentz invariance (invariance under boosts and rotations) is a cornerstone of this framework. SMEFT is an extension of the SM, and it is constructed to be a local, effective quantum field theory. As such, it must maintain Lorentz invariance. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed as Lorentz scalars, formed from the Standard Model fields and their derivatives. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Just like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental requirement for any consistent relativistic quantum field theory, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions like SMEFT. The action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime, is required to be invariant under Poincare transformations. This implies that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers everywhere in spacetime. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably in the weak interactions described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Since the SM, which is the low-energy limit of SMEFT, already violates CP, there is no reason to impose CP symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators of SMEFT. In fact, these new operators can introduce new sources and new types of CP violation, which are actively searched for in experiments. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental theorem of quantum field theory. It states that any theory that is local, has a stable vacuum, and is Lorentz-invariant must also be invariant under the combined transformation of C (charge conjugation), P (parity), and T (time reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. CPT invariance is considered a very fundamental symmetry of nature, and its violation would have profound implications, likely requiring a breakdown of Lorentz invariance itself. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not a required symmetry.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination of 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
