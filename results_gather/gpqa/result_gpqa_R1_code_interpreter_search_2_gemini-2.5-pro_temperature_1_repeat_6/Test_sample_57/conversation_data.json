    "*   **Analysis of the Question:** The question asks to identify the physical theory among the given options that does not require \"regularization at high energies.\" This is a concept from quantum field theory (QFT) related to handling infinities, also known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, that appear in calculations. A theory that never requires regularization at high energies would be one that is \"UV-finite,\" meaning its calculations do not produce such infinities in the first place.\n\n*   **Option A: Classical Electrodynamics:** This is a classical theory, not a quantum one. However, it has its own version of a high-energy/short-distance problem. The self-energy of a classical point charge (like an electron) is infinite if you calculate the energy stored in its electric field. To get a finite answer, one has to \"regularize\" the problem, for instance, by assuming the charge is not a point but is spread out over a tiny sphere. Therefore, this theory does face a divergence problem at short distances (which corresponds to high energies) and requires a form of regularization.\n\n*   **Option C: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like other interacting QFTs in 4 dimensions, calculations of physical quantities using perturbation theory lead to divergent integrals at high energies. QCD is a \"renormalizable\" theory, which means that these infinities can be systematically absorbed into a redefinition of a few physical parameters (like mass and charge) after an initial step of regularization (e.g., introducing an energy cutoff or using dimensional regularization). The fact that it needs renormalization implies it first needs regularization. So, QCD requires regularization.\n\n*   **Option D: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where the need for regularization and renormalization was discovered and successfully implemented. Calculations of quantities like the electron's self-energy or the Lamb shift give infinite results if not regularized. Therefore, QED definitely requires regularization.\n\n*   **Option B: Superstring Theory:** This is a candidate for a unified theory of all forces, including gravity. A primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. Unlike the point particles of QFT, the fundamental objects in string theory are tiny, vibrating, one-dimensional strings. The interactions between these extended objects are not point-like but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect smooths out the interactions at very short distances (high energies), naturally taming the divergences that plague point-particle QFTs. Scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite to all orders of perturbation theory, thus eliminating the need for regularization and renormalization to handle UV divergences.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, only Superstring Theory is believed to be free of high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, and thus it would not require regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
