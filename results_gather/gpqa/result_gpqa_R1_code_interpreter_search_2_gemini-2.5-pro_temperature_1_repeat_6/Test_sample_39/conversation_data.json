    "*   **Analysis of the Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A key activity in such labs is the synthesis of a target molecule, which often results in a mixture of the desired product, unreacted starting materials, and various byproducts. A crucial step following the reaction is the purification of this mixture to isolate the desired compound.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Phrase:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism among chemists. It doesn't literally mean the chemical vials are stacked. Instead, it refers to a problem with a separation or analysis technique where different chemical species are not being resolved from one another.\n\n*   **Common Separation Techniques:** The most common method for separating mixtures in an organic chemistry lab is chromatography, such as Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. In these techniques, the mixture is passed through a stationary phase (like silica gel), and the different compounds travel at different rates depending on their physical properties.\n    *   On a TLC plate, separated compounds appear as distinct \"spots.\" If two compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means their spots have not separated and appear at the same position.\n    *   In column chromatography, the compounds elute from the column at different times and are collected in separate fractions. If they are \"on top of each other,\" they elute at the same time and cannot be separated.\n\n*   **The Principle of Chromatographic Separation:** The separation in standard TLC and column chromatography (using silica gel or alumina) is primarily based on the **polarity** of the compounds. Polar compounds adhere more strongly to the polar stationary phase (silica gel) and move more slowly, while non-polar compounds are carried along more quickly by the less polar mobile phase (the solvent). If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way, causing them to travel at the same rate. This results in them not being separatedâ€”they remain \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used to characterize chiral molecules, not a primary basis for separating common mixtures. This is an unlikely meaning.\n    *   **B) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation or gas chromatography (GC). While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is most iconically associated with spots on a TLC plate, which is governed by polarity.\n    *   **C) Bonding through non-covalent interactions:** This is a description of a fundamental chemical principle, not a specific problem in separation. The *consequence* of these interactions (leading to a specific polarity) is the issue, not the interactions themselves.\n    *   **D) Similar polarities:** This is the most direct and common reason for a failed separation via TLC or column chromatography, the workhorse purification techniques of a synthetic organic lab. When a chemist says their compounds are \"on top of each other,\" they are almost always complaining that they cannot achieve separation because the compounds have nearly identical polarities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemist is most likely referring to a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds in the mixture have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
