    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon and does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula.\n        *   If Z is an alkane, its general formula is CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (14.28%) gives `0.1428 * (14n + 2) = 2n + 2`, which simplifies to `1.9992n + 0.2856 = 2n + 2`. This equation does not yield a positive integer solution for n.\n        *   If Z is a cycloalkane, its general formula is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n        *   `1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   Mixture X (composed of liquids A and B) and mixture Y (composed of liquids C and D) both yield *only* substance Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that A, B, C, and D all must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. For example, if Z were cyclohexane, then hydrogenating A, B, C, and D would break any double bonds and saturate the rings, but the underlying six-carbon ring structure would remain, resulting in cyclohexane. If the components had different skeletons (e.g., a mix of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane derivatives), hydrogenation would produce a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12) for now, as it's a very common solvent. This implies A, B, C, and D are all C6 compounds with a six-membered ring structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by heating mixture X with platinum. This is a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This means both C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. Since we assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), C is cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The other component, D, must be the result of dehydrogenation. The complete dehydrogenation of a cyclohexane ring yields benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Y = {C6H12, C6H6}.\n    *   Let's verify the hydrogenation of Y. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. So, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only one substance, cyclohexane (Z). This is consistent.\n    *   Therefore, our identification of Z as cyclohexane and Y as {cyclohexane, benzene} is correct.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 reaction producing a 1:1 mixture, we can balance the atoms. The total number of atoms on the left must equal the total on the right.\n        *   Reactants: A (C6Hx) + B (C6Hy)\n        *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6\n        *   Balancing carbons: 6 + 6 = 6 + 6. (Consistent with A and B being C6 compounds).\n        *   Balancing hydrogens: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n    *   Let's identify A and B to ensure they fit the remaining criteria.\n        *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. This means A and/or B must have at least one C=C double bond. This implies x < 12 and y < 12.\n        *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of A and B.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10): One double bond, so no conjugation. A possible candidate. (x=10)\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Two double bonds which are conjugated. Ruled out.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Two double bonds which are not conjugated. A possible candidate. (y=8)\n    *   Let's see if this pair works: A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n        *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: the more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) gives two hydrogen atoms to cyclohexene (C6H10).\n            *   C6H8 -> C6H6 + 2H (Dehydrogenation)\n            *   C6H10 + 2H -> C6H12 (Hydrogenation)\n        *   This is a chemically plausible disproportionation reaction. All conditions are met.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   Liquid A is C6H10 (10 hydrogen atoms).\n    *   Liquid B is C6H8 (8 hydrogen atoms).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
