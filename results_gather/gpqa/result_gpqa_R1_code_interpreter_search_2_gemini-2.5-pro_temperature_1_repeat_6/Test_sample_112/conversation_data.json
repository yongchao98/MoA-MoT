    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. These are protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we can confidently conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₀O) and C (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: B (C₆H₁₀O₂) and D (C₆H₁₂O₂). To distinguish between them, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for compounds containing only C, H, and O).\n\n    *   **For D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        *   A DoU of 1 would be entirely satisfied by the C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), meaning it has no C=C double bonds. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which clearly show a C=C bond.\n\n    *   **For B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        *   A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid (1 degree of unsaturation) and the C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) identified by the spectroscopic data. This formula represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid (a hexenoic acid).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all the provided spectra, the only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
