    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one + NaH, then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position 3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH):** This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr):** This is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Williamson ether synthesis**. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first step attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) / cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** The ketone from Step 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide (-NH₂) to form a **tosylhydrazone** (C=N-NHTs), with the elimination of a water molecule. The reaction is typically catalyzed by an acid (HCl).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aq. NH₄Cl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone from Step 2.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl):** A mild proton source for the workup step.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl group. The mechanism involves deprotonation of the hydrazone N-H and then deprotonation of the less-substituted α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). This is followed by the elimination of p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous NH₄Cl workup then protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone group at position 1 is removed and replaced with a double bond between C1 and the less substituted α-carbon, which is C6.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The substituents, benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl, remain. The structure is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. (The numbering changes based on IUPAC rules for alkenes, but the relative 1,3-relationship between the side chains on the six-membered ring is maintained).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H₂**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** The diene from Step 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**. This set of reagents is very effective at two types of transformations occurring here:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group (-OBn) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis under these conditions. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, and a hydrogen atom is added to each fragment. This regenerates the original alcohol (-OH) and produces toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). The relative positions of these groups are 1 and 3. This molecule's name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if only hydrogenation of the alkenes occurred, without the cleavage of the benzyl ether. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H₂ typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure results from an incorrect reaction order and an incomplete reaction.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product. It has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure incorrectly assumes that n-butyllithium acted as a nucleophile attacking a carbonyl group.\n\nThe correct product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
