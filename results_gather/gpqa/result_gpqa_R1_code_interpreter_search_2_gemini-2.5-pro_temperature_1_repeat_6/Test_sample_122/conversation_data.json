    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (which we can consider the \"stationary\" frame) and the supernova ejecta's frame (the \"moving\" frame).\n    *   The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. Due to the principle of relativity, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would also see the ejecta moving towards them at the same speed, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock), `Δt_proper = 50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   Crucially, the time used in this calculation must be the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt_dilated` or `Δt_galaxy`) is related to the proper time (`Δt_proper`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt_dilated = γ * Δt_proper`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, `β = v/c`:\n          `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   Next, square this ratio:\n          `β² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n        *   Now, calculate γ:\n          `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (the time passed in the Galaxy's frame).**\n        *   `Δt_dilated = γ * Δt_proper`\n        *   `Δt_dilated = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   `distance = v * Δt_dilated`\n        *   `distance = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        *   `distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        *   `distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step D: Final calculation.**\n        *   Using a calculator, `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n        *   `distance ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   This value is very close to option A.\n        *   A) 3,060,000 km\n        *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored)\n        *   C) 2,940,000 km\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The most plausible choice is A, with the small difference likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_proper = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# The distance in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt_dilated).\n# The time in the Galaxy's frame (dt_dilated) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (dt_proper) by the Lorentz factor (gamma).\n# dt_dilated = gamma * dt_proper\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# So, distance = v * gamma * dt_proper\n\n# Calculate gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time\ndt_dilated = gamma * dt_proper\n\n# Calculate the distance\ndistance = v * dt_dilated\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\nThe calculation shows the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Moving Frame:** The supernova ejecta.

The Goal**\n\nWe need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame (frame S).
