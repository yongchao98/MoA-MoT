    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** We are looking for a mixture of two isomers of C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Candidate Compounds:**\n    We need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key aspects are the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the integration (number of protons) for each signal.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n        *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n        *   Symmetry: There is one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n            *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). -> 1 singlet.\n            *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H). -> 1 singlet.\n            *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H). -> 1 singlet.\n        *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n        *   Symmetry: There is one plane of symmetry passing between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, but because they are chemically identical (an AA' system), they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n            *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H). -> 1 singlet.\n            *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H). -> 1 singlet.\n        *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. Correct.\n        *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: The alkyl groups will show splitting.\n            *   The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3) integrating to **4H**.\n            *   The two CH3 groups are equivalent and will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2) integrating to **6H**.\n        *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H). The problem states all signals are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out of any mixture that doesn't also contain splitting patterns.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixture Options:**\n    Now we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the given data.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture would contain a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contradicts the data (only singlets observed). Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, we would see a total of **three singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also matches the data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option perfectly matches all the given spectral data.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part matches.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show a total of four singlets. This contradicts the data (only three singlets observed). Incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part matches.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would show at least four signals (one might overlap), but the ratios would be (6H+6H) : 6H : 3H : 3H or something similar, not 2:1:1. Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio AND three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
