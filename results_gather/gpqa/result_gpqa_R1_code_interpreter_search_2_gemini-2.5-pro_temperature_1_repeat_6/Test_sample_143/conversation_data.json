    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($d$) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Total energy of the particle X in the lab frame, $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass of the particle X, $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2$. In particle physics, it's common to set $c=1$, so we write $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   Decay width of the particle X, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. It's given by its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$): $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is subject to relativistic time dilation. It's related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is inversely related to the decay width $\\Gamma_X$ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Combining these, we get: $d = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   It is often more convenient to work with momentum ($p$) and energy ($E$). The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v$, and the relativistic energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$. The factor $v \\gamma$ can be expressed as $\\frac{p c^2}{E}$. A more useful expression is $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   The decay distance formula can be written as $d = c \\cdot \\gamma \\beta \\cdot \\tau_0 = c \\cdot \\gamma \\beta \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Substituting $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$, we get:\n        $d = c \\cdot \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$. This is a very convenient formula as it uses standard particle physics quantities.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Quantities:**\n    *   **Momentum-energy term ($pc$):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$. We can solve for $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\, \\text{GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} \\, \\text{GeV} = \\sqrt{62.56} \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   **Convert units:** To ensure consistency, we'll convert all energy-related terms to MeV.\n        $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$ (already in MeV).\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62.56} \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV} = 7909.5 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Constant ($\\hbar c$):** The value of the reduced Planck constant times the speed of light is approximately $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV}\\cdot\\text{fm}$. A femtometer (fm) is $10^{-15}$ meters.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result:**\n    *   Now, we plug all the values into our formula:\n        $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV}\\cdot\\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n    *   The GeV units in the first term cancel, and the MeV units in the second term cancel, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n        $d = \\left( \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{197.327}{320} \\right) \\, \\text{fm}$\n        $d \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot (0.6166) \\, \\text{fm}$\n        $d \\approx 4.0655 \\, \\text{fm}$\n    *   **Unit Conversion:** Finally, we convert the result from femtometers to meters.\n        Since $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$,\n        $d \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nThis result matches option D.

    "The problem asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understand the concepts:**\n    *   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: This is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It's related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Lab Lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$)**: Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime of a moving particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime. It's given by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance ($d$)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's calculated as $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    *   $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma v \\tau_0$.\n    *   It is often convenient to express this in terms of energy and momentum. We know that the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$ and momentum $p = \\gamma m v$.\n    *   From the momentum formula, we can write $\\gamma v = \\frac{p}{m}$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the distance formula: $d = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0$.\n    *   Now substitute the expression for $\\tau_0$: $d = \\frac{p}{m} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$.\n    *   Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c^2$ (speed of light squared) gives a more convenient form using standard particle physics units:\n        $d = \\frac{pc^2}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$.\n    *   This can be rewritten as: $d = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$. This is the final formula we will use.\n\n3.  **List the given values and constants:**\n    *   Energy in the lab frame, $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   A useful physical constant is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\, \\text{MeV}\\cdot\\text{fm}$ which is $1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV}\\cdot\\text{m}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the necessary quantities:**\n    *   We need the momentum term, $pc$. We can find it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 = (8 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 = 64 \\, \\text{GeV}^2 - 1.44 \\, \\text{GeV}^2 = 62.56 \\, \\text{GeV}^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{62.56} \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final decay distance:**\n    *   Now, plug all the values into the formula $d = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n    *   $d = \\frac{7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\cdot \\frac{1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV}\\cdot\\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}}$.\n    *   The GeV units cancel out, leaving the result in meters.\n    *   $d = \\left( \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1.973 \\times 10^{-16}}{0.320} \\right) \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   $d \\approx (6.59125) \\cdot (6.1656 \\times 10^{-16}) \\, \\text{m}$\n    *   $d \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    *   B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    *   C) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    *   D) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value of $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$ is extremely close to option D. The minor difference ($0.001 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$) is due to rounding of the physical constants used to generate the problem options.\n\nThe code execution also confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
