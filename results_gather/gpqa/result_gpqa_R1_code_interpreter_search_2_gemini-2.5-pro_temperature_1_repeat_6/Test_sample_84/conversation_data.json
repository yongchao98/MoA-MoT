    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_1)}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_2)}}$\n    The problem states that the albedo is the same for both planets ($A_1 = A_2$). The star's temperature ($T_{star}$) and radius ($R_{star}$) are also common terms. Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n4.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) in the star's light is caused by its \"wobble\" due to the planet's gravity. This wobble has a maximum velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K). The relationship is:\n    $K = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where `c` is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n    The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\times (\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)}{c \\times (\\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n    Using the given values:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced on the star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis (`a`). Assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$) and the orbit is viewed edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet), the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}^2} \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    Now, substitute the known ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios and values\n# Mass ratio M2/M1\nM_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Doppler shift values\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms for Planet1\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms for Planet2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2)\n# Since K is proportional to delta_lambda, the ratio of K's is the ratio of delta_lambda's.\nK_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# The formula relating a, M_p, and K is a ∝ (M_p/K)^2\n# Therefore, a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio = (M_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n# The formula for T_eq is T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a)\n# Therefore, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\n# An alternative simpler calculation found during derivation:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2/M1) * (K1/K2) which is M_ratio * K_ratio\nT_ratio_simple = M_ratio * K_ratio\n\n# Print the final result to check against the options\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures is: {T_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The simplified calculation gives: {T_ratio_simple:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<\nThe calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures is: 0.5357\nThe simplified calculation gives: 0.5357\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
