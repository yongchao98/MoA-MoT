    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The fact that these peaks have similar chemical shifts suggests the two environments are structurally very similar.\n    *   The equal integrals, summing to the expected 1H, mean that the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The presence of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that there are two distinct, separable chemical species in the mixture.\n    *   The fact that they have the same mass spectrum (MS) proves that the two species are isomers of each otherâ€”they have the same molecular formula and mass.\n    *   The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the NMR finding that the two species are present in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The separation at \"elevated temperature\" suggests that the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert, or that the barrier to interconversion is high enough that they remain distinct on the timescale of the chromatography experiment.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are different compounds, diastereomers are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have slightly different chemical shifts. This fits the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This fits the observation of two LC peaks. As isomers, they would have the identical mass, fitting the MS data.\n        *   **Formation:** In peptide synthesis, a mixture of diastereomers can easily be formed if one of the amino acid chiral centers is racemized during a coupling step, or if one of the starting amino acids was not enantiomerically pure. This would lead to a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers, consistent with the equal peak integrals/intensities. This explanation is fully consistent with all the provided data. A common example of this phenomenon in peptides is also atropisomerism (e.g., cis/trans isomers of a proline amide bond), which are a form of diastereomers.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they are indistinguishable.\n        *   **NMR:** They would give an identical 1H NMR spectrum, showing only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC-MS:** They would co-elute on a standard LC column, showing only one peak.\n        *   This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would be a different molecule with a different chemical formula and a different mass.\n        *   **LC-MS:** The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the *expected molecule*. A precursor would have a different mass.\n        *   This explanation is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This term usually refers to a repeated reaction step. If it led to a side product (e.g., acylation at a second site), that product would have a different molecular formula and a different mass.\n        *   **LC-MS:** As with option C, this is inconsistent with the observation that both peaks have the same mass.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the analytical data (two NMR peaks, two LC peaks, same mass for both peaks, 1:1 ratio) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
