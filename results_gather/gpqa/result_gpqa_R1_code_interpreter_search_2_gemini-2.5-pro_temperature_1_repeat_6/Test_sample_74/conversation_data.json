You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Analysis of the experimental setup:** The goal is to express a fusion protein in mammalian cells (CHO). This protein consists of an N-terminal HA tag followed by the mouse GADD45G protein. The experiment fails because the protein is not expressed at the expected levels. The provided DNA sequence is the coding strand of the constructed gene.\n\n*   **Analysis of the provided DNA sequence:** We need to translate this DNA sequence into a protein sequence to understand what is being synthesized. Translation in eukaryotes almost always starts at the first ATG codon. The sequence is read in triplets (codons) from that point.\n    *   The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`. This is the start codon for Methionine (M), which initiates translation.\n    *   The next part of the sequence should encode the HA tag. The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's check if the DNA sequence corresponds to this.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   So far, the translated protein is `M-YPYDVPDYA...`. This is the correct sequence for an N-terminally tagged HA protein. This rules out option A, as there is no missense mutation in the tag.\n    *   Now, let's continue reading the sequence in codons from where we left off. The sequence is `...TAC GCC AAA TGA...`.\n        *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n        *   `TGA` -> **STOP codon**.\n    *   The DNA sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the codons for the HA tag and a single Lysine residue. `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`) that signal the ribosome to terminate translation.\n\n*   **Evaluating the consequences:**\n    *   Because of this premature stop codon, the ribosome will start translation, synthesize a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K), and then fall off the mRNA.\n    *   The full-length GADD45G protein will never be synthesized. This directly explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein. The issue is not proteolysis (option B) or a problem with the tag sequence itself (option A).\n\n*   **Evaluating the options based on the analysis:**\n    *   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The HA tag sequence is translated correctly.\n    *   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, the primary issue is that the full-length protein is not even being made. The problem is a lack of synthesis, not degradation.\n    *   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. The in-frame `TGA` stop codon causes premature termination of translation, preventing the synthesis of the full-length protein.\n    *   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the codon in question is `TGA` (UGA in mRNA), not `TAA` (UAA in mRNA). Second, there are no tRNAs for *any* stop codon; they are recognized by protein release factors.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a premature stop codon (`TGA`) right after the tag sequence is the \"annoying reason\" for the failure of the experiment. This means the ribosome stops protein synthesis far too early.\n\n<<<C>>>"
