    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\nThe formula for DBE is: `DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`\n*   C = 9 (number of carbons)\n*   H = 11 (number of hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (number of nitrogens)\n*   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\nA DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for the fifth DBE.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester (around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹) or possibly a conjugated ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula, an ester is the most likely functional group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). The chemical shift is typical for a methyl (-CH₃) group. This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the other part of the -CH₂-CH₃ fragment. The high chemical shift (deshielded) at 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom.\n*   **Combining these two signals (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet and quartet pattern is the signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The deshielded position of the quartet suggests an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Broad singlets are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in O-H or N-H groups. Since the IR spectrum indicated a primary amine (-NH₂), this signal is assigned to the two protons of the amine group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring have different electronic properties, causing the two sets of equivalent protons to have different chemical shifts.\n    *   An amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating and will shield the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting their signal upfield (to a lower ppm value).\n    *   An ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing and will deshield the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting their signal downfield (to a higher ppm value).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOCH₂CH₃ group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify with the Options:**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This would have a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-), not an ethyl ester.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, and it's a primary amide, which has a different C=O IR frequency.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide with only one N-H proton and a formyl proton (-CHO).\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. The structure perfectly matches all the fragments and spectral data analyzed: C₉H₁₁NO₂ formula, primary amine, ester, ethyl group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<D>>>"
