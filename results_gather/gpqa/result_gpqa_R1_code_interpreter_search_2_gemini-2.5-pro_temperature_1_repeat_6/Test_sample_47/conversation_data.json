    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed (or neutral) alpha-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. Assuming monobromination, the product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\nThis is a classic Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone reacts with a strong base. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the other acidic α-proton from C6.\n2.  The resulting enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sɴ2 reaction, where the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond to relieve ring strain. This process forms a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) with a carboxylate group.\n5.  Upon acidic workup (implied), the carboxylate is protonated.\nProduct 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The -OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom.\nProduct 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce an acyl chloride to an aldehyde without further reduction to the alcohol.\nProduct 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\nNow we need to analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde and determine how many unique hydrogen environments exist.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to a formyl group (-CHO).\n1.  **Chirality:** The carbon atom on the ring to which the formyl group is attached (let's call it C1) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO)\n    *   A hydrogen atom\n    *   The C2 carbon of the ring\n    *   The C5 carbon of the ring\n    Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral.\n\n2.  **Symmetry:** A chiral molecule, by definition, lacks any improper axis of rotation (Sₙ), which includes planes of symmetry and centers of inversion. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde also lacks any axis of rotational symmetry (Cₙ, n>1).\n\n3.  **Chemical Equivalence:** In a molecule with no symmetry elements, all atoms that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically distinct. This means their chemical environments are different, and they will produce separate signals in an NMR spectrum (barring accidental overlap).\n\n4.  **Counting the Hydrogens:** Let's count all the hydrogen atoms in their unique positions:\n    *   **Aldehyde hydrogen:** The one hydrogen in the -CHO group. This is one unique type. (1 H)\n    *   **Methine hydrogen:** The one hydrogen on the chiral carbon, C1. This is a second unique type. (1 H)\n    *   **Methylene hydrogens on C2:** The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because they are on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center. They are chemically distinct from each other. (2 H)\n    *   **Methylene hydrogens on C5:** Similarly, the two hydrogens on C5 are diastereotopic. (2 H)\n    *   **Methylene hydrogens on C3:** The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. (2 H)\n    *   **Methylene hydrogens on C4:** The two hydrogens on C4 are also diastereotopic. (2 H)\n\n    Because the entire molecule is asymmetric, the environment of C2 is different from C5, and the environment of C3 is different from C4. Therefore, all the protons we've listed are in unique chemical environments.\n\n    *   Total distinct hydrogens = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2) + 2 (on C3) + 2 (on C4) + 2 (on C5) = **10**.\n\nEach of the 10 hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is in a unique chemical environment due to the lack of symmetry in the chiral molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
