    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (let's denote it as YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n    Let M_Y be the atomic mass of element Y, and the atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * Mass(F)) / (Mass(Y) + n * Mass(F))\n\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n\n    Rearranging for M_Y:\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M_Y = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) and a corresponding element Y whose atomic mass M_Y satisfies this equation.\n\n2.  **Test plausible values for n.**\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar).\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Br).\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol).\n    *   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Dy).\n    *   If n = 5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Tl).\n    *   If n = 6, M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (close to Pu, Plutonium, M≈244 g/mol).\n\n3.  **Verify the best candidates.**\n    Let's calculate the precise mass percentage for the most promising candidates, Antimony (Sb) and Plutonium (Pu), using more accurate atomic masses (F ≈ 18.998 g/mol, Sb ≈ 121.76 g/mol, Pu ≈ 244 g/mol).\n\n    *   For Y = Sb and n = 3 (SbF3):\n        MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%.\n        This is very close to the given 31.96% (a difference of only 0.08%).\n\n    *   For Y = Pu and n = 6 (PuF6):\n        MW(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.988 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (6 * 18.998) / 357.988 = 113.988 / 357.988 ≈ 0.3184, or 31.84%.\n        This is also very close to 31.96% (a difference of 0.12%).\n\n    Both Sb and Pu are excellent candidates based on the mass percentage. However, the problem describes a series of chemical reactions and properties which we must use to make the final determination. Many of the properties described for Plutonium's compounds (e.g., decomposition of A1->A2+F2, a colorless solution for A4) lead to contradictions with known chemistry or require assuming the existence of hypothetical compounds (like PuF8). The Antimony path, while also having contradictions regarding the properties of A1, leads to a more plausible result when considering the final multiple-choice options.\n\n4.  **Proceed with the hypothesis Y = Sb.**\n    *   **Y = Antimony (Sb)**.\n    *   **A2 = SbF3** (based on the mass percentage calculation).\n    *   The problem states \"A1 ... decomposes ... into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine.\" This implies the reaction is `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. For this to be true, A1 must be a higher fluoride, which would be **SbF5**. (Note: This contradicts the known properties of SbF5, which is a stable colorless liquid, not a bright-red substance that decomposes at room temperature. For the sake of solving the puzzle, we must assume these properties are either given incorrectly or refer to a specific, unstable form).\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and reacts with Xenon. The fluorination of antimony can produce SbF3 or SbF5. Since it reacts with Xenon (implying strong oxidizing or Lewis acid character), **A3 is SbF5**. SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and forms adducts with Xenon fluorides.\n    *   The five known binary compounds are likely a loose reference to SbF3, SbF5, and their polymeric forms or related complex ions.\n\n5.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight of A4. A4 is one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The candidates are SbF3 and SbF5. We must determine which one is A4.\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   MW(SbF3) = 178.754 g/mol.\n    *   MW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's examine the multiple-choice options provided:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.754 g/mol) falls perfectly into the range **160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.75 g/mol) does not fit well into any range, being closest to B) 220-240.\n\n    This provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\n6.  **Final Check.**\n    If A4=SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. This specific reaction is not standard. However, similar to the issues with A1's properties, this might be a hypothetical reaction for the problem's context (e.g., forming a subfluoride like `2SbF`). The hydrolysis of A5 (e.g. `SbF + H2O -> SbOH + HF`) would produce two substances, which is consistent with the problem statement. Given that this path is the only one that leads to a clear answer among the choices, we select it.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 179 g/mol, which is in the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
