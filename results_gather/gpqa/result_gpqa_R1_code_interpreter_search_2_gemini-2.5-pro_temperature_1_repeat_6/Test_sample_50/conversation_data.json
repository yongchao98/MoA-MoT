    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system (the charge `q` plus the sphere with its induced charges).\n\n2.  **Method of Image Charges:** This problem is a classic application of the \"method of image charges.\" To find the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, we can replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero, matching the grounded condition.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The real charge `q` is on the x-axis at `x = d`.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is placed on the x-axis at `x = b`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere, the image charge and its position must be:\n        *   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    This setup (the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`) correctly reproduces the potential everywhere outside the sphere.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common and straightforward way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, \"other charges\" refers to the induced charge distribution on the sphere.\n\n5.  **Finding V_induced:**\n    Using the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charge is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. So, we need to find the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` (at distance `b`).\n\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    *   The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-q * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Energy Calculation:**\n    Now, substitute this `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option B. The energy is negative because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere."
