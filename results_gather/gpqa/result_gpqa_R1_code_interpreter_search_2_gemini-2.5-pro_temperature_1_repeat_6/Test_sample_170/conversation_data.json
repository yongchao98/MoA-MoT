    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the directing effects of substituents.**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The substituent already present on the ring determines the position of the incoming electrophile (Br+). Substituents are classified based on their effect on the reaction rate (activating/deactivating) and the position they direct the incoming group to (ortho, para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n*   **Activating groups**: These donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They are *ortho, para*-directors.\n*   **Deactivating groups**: These withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. Most are *meta*-directors. Halogens are an exception: they are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nThe question asks to rank the substances in order of *increasing yield of the para-isomer*. This means we need to compare the percentage of the para-product formed for each substance.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents for each substance.**\n\nLet's analyze the substituent for each of the six substances:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the substances into two groups based on expected para-isomer yield.**\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield)**: The meta-directors will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, with very small amounts of ortho and para isomers. This group includes:\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield)**: The ortho, para-directors will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. This group includes:\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n\nFrom this grouping, we know that the final ordered list will have the substances from Group 1 followed by the substances from Group 2.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the substances within Group 1 (meta-directors).**\n\nFor meta-directors, the ortho and para positions are strongly deactivated. The stronger the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) effect of the substituent, the more selective the reaction is for the meta position, and consequently, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the substituents: -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\nThe established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: **para(-NO2) < para(-COOH) < para(-COOC2H5)**.\nIn terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   Typical para-yields: Nitrobenzene (~0.3%), Benzoic acid (~1-2%), Ethyl benzoate (~3%).\n\n**Step 5: Rank the substances within Group 2 (ortho, para-directors).**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho product. This ratio is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5)**: Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the attack of the incoming electrophile at the ortho positions more significantly. As a result, the proportion of the para-isomer is higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **para(C6H5-CH3) < para(C6H5-C2H5)**, or **1 < 5**.\n    *   Typical para-yields: Toluene (~62%), Ethylbenzene (~65%).\n\n*   **Comparing -Cl (3) with the alkyl groups (1, 5)**: The chlorine atom has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and a weaker electron-donating resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect deactivates the ring, especially at the nearby ortho positions. This makes the para position relatively more reactive than the ortho position compared to alkyl-substituted benzenes. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio for chlorobenzene.\n    *   The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Typical para-yield: Chlorobenzene (~87%).\n    *   Order: **para(C6H5-C2H5) < para(C6H5-Cl)**, or **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the rankings for Group 2, we get the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the rankings of both groups.**\n\nWe combine the ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Group 1) < (Group 2)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
