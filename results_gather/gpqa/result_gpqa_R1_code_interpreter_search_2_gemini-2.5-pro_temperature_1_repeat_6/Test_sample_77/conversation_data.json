    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields from a moving charge are not determined by its instantaneous position but by its position at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is the time at which the charge emitted the field that reaches the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the current time `t`. The time delay is the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d` from the charge's retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThis relationship is given by the equation:\n$t - t_r = \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nUsing the notation from the problem description:\n- $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n- $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n- $\\vec{v} = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retardation equation becomes:\n$t - t_r = \\dfrac{d}{c}$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials (Heuristic argument)\n\nThe potentials for a point charge can be derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a distribution using Dirac delta functions. A full derivation involves a careful integration that accounts for the fact that the retarded time itself depends on the integration variable.\n\nThe standard derivation (found in textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") leads to the following results for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\nThe potential is not simply $\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o d}$. An additional correction factor arises because the volume element of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to the charge's motion. This effect is captured by a factor in the denominator.\n\nThe scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nLet's rearrange this to match the format of the options:\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\nSo,\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\nThis can be written as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option B.\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\nSimilarly, the vector potential is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nRearranging this expression:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\nThis can be written as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis matches the vector potential in option B.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(...) = ..., A(...) = ... with a `+` sign in the denominator.** This corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are valid mathematical solutions but are generally discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (the effect would precede the cause). The problem setup with `t > tr` implies retarded potentials.\n\n*   **B) V(...) = ..., A(...) = ... with a `-` sign in the denominator.** These are the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert retarded potentials, as derived above. The term `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})` in the denominator correctly accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\n*   **C) V(...) = $\\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, A(...) = $\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(...)$**. The expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects retardation and the dynamic correction factor. While the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the starting expression for `V` is wrong.\n\n*   **D) V(...) = $\\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, A(...) = $\\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(...)$**. The expression for `V` is again the static potential. The expression for `A` is dimensionally incorrect since $\\vec{A}$ is a vector but $\\frac{v^2}{c^2}V$ is a scalar.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are those given in option B. They properly account for the retardation of the electromagnetic signal and the effect of the charge's motion on the observed potential.\n\nThe correct expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
