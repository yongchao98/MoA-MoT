    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Model**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule (X-Y) using the quantum rotation-vibration model (also known as the non-rigid rotor model). In this model, the total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. The energy levels are quantized and described by two quantum numbers:\n*   `v`: the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J`: the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n\nThe energy of a specific state `(v, J)` is given by the formula:\n`E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n**2. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\" or ground state. This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". This transition must obey the selection rules for photon absorption in a diatomic molecule. For an infrared (rovibrational) transition, the selection rules are:\n    *   `Δv = +1` (for absorption)\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`\n\nStarting from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)`:\n*   A transition with `Δv = +1` means the final vibrational state is `v' = 1`.\n*   A transition with `ΔJ = ±1` means the final rotational state could be `J' = J + 1 = 1` or `J' = J - 1 = -1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`, leading to `J' = 1`.\n\nTherefore, the only allowed transition from the ground state `(0,0)` to the next vibrational level is to the state `(v'=1, J'=1)`. This is the final state.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must be equal to the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n`E_photon = ΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)`\n\nUsing the energy formula:\n`E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n`E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\nNow, find the difference:\n`ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]`\n`ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nThis means the total energy absorbed is the sum of the fundamental vibrational energy quantum (`ħω`) and the energy required for the first rotational jump (`ħ²/I`).\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nTo find `ΔE`, we need to calculate the moment of inertia, `I`.\n`I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    `μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):** We need to convert all units to SI.\n    *   `Mx = 20 amu * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) = 3.321 x 10⁻²⁶ kg`\n    *   `My = 2 amu * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) = 3.321 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n    *   `R = 2 Å * (10⁻¹⁰ m/Å) = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) = 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n    *   `I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n*   **Energy Components:**\n    *   `Vibrational Energy Part (ħω):`\n        `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    *   `Rotational Energy Part (ħ²/I):`\n        `ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) = 9.18 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.18 x 10⁻²³ J = 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    (Note that the rotational energy contribution is much smaller than the vibrational one).\n\n**5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the equation `E = pc`. Therefore, the momentum is `p = E / c`.\n\n*   `p = ΔE / c`\n*   `p = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)`\n*   `p = 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s` or `N·s`\n\nThis value is `1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34\n# Atomic mass unit in kg\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27\n# Angstrom in meters\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 2.9979e8\n\n# --- Given Molecular Properties ---\n# Mass of atom X in amu\nMx_amu = 20\n# Mass of atom Y in amu\nMy_amu = 2\n# Bond length in angstroms\nR_angstrom = 2\n# Angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\nw = 4e14\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1.

Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# 4. Calculate the energy of the transition (Delta E)\n# The transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1)\n# Delta_E = (E_vib_final - E_vib_initial) + (E_rot_final - E_rot_initial)\n# Delta_E = h_bar*w + h_bar^2/I\ndelta_E = (h_bar * w) + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# 5.

    "The problem asks for the momentum of a photon that can excite a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next lowest possible energy state within the rotation-vibration model.\n\n**1. Energy Levels of the Rotation-Vibration Model**\n\nThe energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n`E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B = ħ² / (2I)` is the rotational constant, with `I` being the moment of inertia.\n\n**2. Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State (Ground State):** This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which occurs when `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State (Next Lowest Energy State):** The molecule absorbs a photon, so it must undergo a transition. The selection rules for rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from `v = 0`, the next vibrational level is `v' = 1`.\n    *   Starting from `J = 0`, the only possible change is `ΔJ = +1`, leading to a final rotational state of `J' = 1`. (Since `J` cannot be negative, `ΔJ = -1` is not allowed).\n    Therefore, the final state is `(v' = 1, J' = 1)`.\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n**3. Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states (`ΔE`).\n`E_photon = ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n`ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n`ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\nSubstituting `B = ħ² / (2I)`, we get:\n`ΔE = ħω + 2(ħ² / 2I) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n**4. Calculation of Physical Quantities**\n\nWe need to calculate the moment of inertia `I`. First, we find the reduced mass `μ`.\n*   **Masses in SI units (kg):**\n    `Mx = 20 amu * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) = 3.321 x 10⁻²⁶ kg`\n    `My = 2 amu * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) = 3.321 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n*   **Bond Length in SI units (m):**\n    `R = 2 Å * (10⁻¹⁰ m/Å) = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    `I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n**5. Calculation of the Photon Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy change.\n*   **Vibrational Energy Component:** `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   **Rotational Energy Component:** `ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.18 x 10⁻²³ J`\n*   **Total Energy:** `ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00918 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n**6. Calculation of the Photon Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (`≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s`).\n`p = ΔE / c`\n`p = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis calculated value is `1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. Comparing this to the options:\nA) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N*s\nB) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N*s\nC) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N*s\nD) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N*s\n\nThe calculated value matches option C. The Python code execution confirmed this result (`1.410e-28 N*s`), which rounds to `1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N*s`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
