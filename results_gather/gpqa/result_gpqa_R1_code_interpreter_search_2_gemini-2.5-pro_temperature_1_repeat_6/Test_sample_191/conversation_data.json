    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field outside the spherical conductor.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero. It has a spherical cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge `+q` will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** The charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's law. If we consider a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface. For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge on the inner surface must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` inside.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall charge neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. The total charge of the conductor remains `(-q) + (+q) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the cavity (`+q`) and the induced charges on the inner surface (`-q`) arrange themselves in such a way that their net electric field outside the cavity, within the conductor material, is zero. This effectively \"shields\" the outer surface from the specific arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is only influenced by the geometry of the outer surface itself (a sphere of radius R) and any external electric fields (of which there are none). Therefore, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (Shell Theorem).\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge `+q` located at the center O. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of this field is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The location of the cavity (`s`), the location of the charge within the cavity, the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the net charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derived result.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This ignores the shielding effect of the conductor.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
