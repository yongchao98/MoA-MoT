    "An optically active compound must be chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). A molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   Although the groups on the double bond are all different (`Cl` vs `H` and `CH3` vs `CH2CH3`), the molecule is not chiral. It possesses accessible conformations that have a plane of symmetry (e.g., when the `Cl-C=C-C-C` skeleton is planar). Due to free rotation around the C-C single bonds, the molecule is, on average, symmetric. Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the absolute configuration of several stereocenters (`3aR`, `7aS`) and a double bond (`E`).\n    *   The presence of these stereochemical descriptors indicates that this is a specific, single stereoisomer.\n    *   The complex structure is based on a norbornane skeleton, which can be achiral (meso) in some substituted forms. However, the presence of an unsymmetrical substituent like `chloromethylene` (`=CHCl`) on the skeleton typically destroys any pre-existing symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry).\n    *   A single stereoisomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This compound is not a meso compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, with a `HOOC-CH(CH3)-` group at each end.\n    *   The stereocenters have opposite configurations (`R` and `S`).\n    *   This combination (`R,S` in a symmetric molecule) creates an internal plane of symmetry. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It also has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   In this isomer, both stereocenters have the same configuration (`R` and `R`).\n    *   The molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore a chiral molecule.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the `-OH` group, is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH2-CH=` and `-C=CH-CH2-`.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This notation describes the all-`cis` isomer, where the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a `C-OH` group.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2C(=O)cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since two of the four groups are identical, this is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
