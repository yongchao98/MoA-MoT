This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The primary objective is to find a mutation that inactivates the gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n*   **Understanding the Genetic Code:** The DNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon and continues until a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached. A mutation that creates a stop codon early in the sequence is called a nonsense mutation and is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Translating the Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Breaking it into codons:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   The beginning of the intact protein is: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n*   **Analyzing the Mutants:**\n\n    1.  **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Translation: `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   Protein: Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala...\n        *   **Effect:** This is a missense mutation. The third amino acid has changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. This might alter or destroy the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n    2.  **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Translation: `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), `TAA` (STOP).\n        *   Protein: Met-Phe.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a nonsense mutation. The third codon `TAA` is a premature stop codon. Protein synthesis will terminate, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment instead of the full protein. This fragment will be non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the final compound.\n\n    3.  **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n        *   Translation: `ATG` (Met), `TTT` (Phe), `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   Protein: Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala...\n        *   **Effect:** This is also a missense mutation, changing Leucine to Tyrosine (similar to Mutant 1, assuming a different mutational path). Like Mutant 1, it is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    4.  **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (This sequence appears to have a substitution creating `TAC` from `CTC` and a deletion of the `GGT` codon).\n        *   Translation: `ATG` (Met), `TTT` (Phe), `TAC` (Tyr), `ACT` (Thr)...\n        *   **Effect:** This is a combination of a missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr) and an in-frame deletion (the amino acid Glycine is missing). While this is a major change that will likely disrupt the protein, it's not as definitive as an early stop codon. The rest of the protein is still translated, and some residual function, however unlikely, cannot be ruled out.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Comparing the four mutants, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic. It halts protein synthesis almost immediately, guaranteeing the production of a non-functional, severely truncated protein. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
