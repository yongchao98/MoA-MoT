    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`\n    where `R` is the star's radius, `T` is its surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1^2 * σ * T1^4) / (4 * π * R2^2 * σ * T2^4)`\n    The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so the ratio of the radii `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4`\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Wavelength:** Wien's Displacement Law connects a black body's temperature (`T`) to the peak wavelength (`λ_max_emit`) of its emitted radiation:\n    `T = b / λ_max_emit`\n    where `b` is Wien's constant. This means temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    `T1 / T2 = λ_max_emit_2 / λ_max_emit_1`\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (\"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest\") are the same (`λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2`). The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:\n    `λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`\n    where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light. By convention, a positive velocity means the object is moving away (receding).\n\n7.  **Calculate Emitted Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1: `v1 = 0`. The formula simplifies to `λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_emit_1`.\n    *   For Star_2: `v2 = 700 km/s`. This is a receding velocity. Let `β = v2 / c`. The formula is `λ_max_obs_2 = λ_max_emit_2 * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))`.\n\n8.  **Find the Ratio of Emitted Wavelengths:** Since `λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2`, we can set the expressions for them equal to each other:\n    `λ_max_emit_1 = λ_max_emit_2 * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))`\n\n9.  **Find the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this relationship back into the temperature ratio from step 5:\n    `T1 / T2 = λ_max_emit_2 / (λ_max_emit_2 * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β)))`\n    `T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β)) = sqrt((1 - β) / (1 + β))`\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4:\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4`\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (sqrt((1 - β) / (1 + β)))^4`\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - β) / (1 + β))^2`\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:** Use the given values to calculate the final answer. The extraneous information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n    *   `v2 = 700 km/s`\n    *   `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s`\n    *   `β = v2 / c = 700 / 299792.458`\n    We can now use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants based on the problem statement.\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.\nv2 = 700.0\n# The speed of light in km/s.\nc = 299792.458\n\n# Calculate beta, the ratio of the star's velocity to the speed of light.\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L1/L2.\n# The formula is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the relativistic Doppler effect.\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))\n# So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))^2\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 2.229. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value `~2.229` is closest to `~2.23`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n- L is the luminosity\n- R is the radius of the star\n- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n- T is the surface temperature of the star\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, so the equation simplifies to:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)^4\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know the ratio of the radii:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂  => R₁/R₂ = 1.5\nSubstituting this into the equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)^4 = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)^4\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures (T₁/T₂). According to Wien's Displacement Law, the temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emit):\nT = b / λ_emit\nwhere b is Wien's constant.\nTherefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emit₁) / (b / λ_emit₂) = λ_emit₂ / λ_emit₁\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the observed wavelength and the emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:\nλ_obs = λ_emit * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\nwhere v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0. Therefore, its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength:\nλ_obs₁ = λ_emit₁ * √[(1 + 0) / (1 - 0)] = λ_emit₁\n\nFor Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Let β = v₂/c. The observed wavelength is:\nλ_obs₂ = λ_emit₂ * √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)]\n\nSince we are given that the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\nλ_emit₁ = λ_emit₂ * √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)]\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\nλ_emit₂ / λ_emit₁ = 1 / √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)] = √[(1 - β) / (1 + β)]\n\nThis ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\nT₁ / T₂ = √[(1 - β) / (1 + β)]\n\nFinally, we substitute this temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)^4\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√[(1 - β) / (1 + β)])^4\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - β) / (1 + β)]²\n\nThe value of β is v₂/c = 700 km/s / 299792.458 km/s. The calculation was performed in the code step:\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not relevant to this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
