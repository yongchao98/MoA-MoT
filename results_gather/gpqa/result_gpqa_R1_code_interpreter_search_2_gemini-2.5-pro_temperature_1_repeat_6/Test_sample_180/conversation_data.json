    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Baseline Solar Neutrino Spectrum:**\n    First, we need to know which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos and at what energies. The primary source of the Sun's energy is the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), and a smaller contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces \"pp\" neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** Produces \"pep\" neutrinos (a line at 1.44 MeV) and, crucially, \"⁷Be\" neutrinos. The ⁷Be neutrinos are produced in two discrete energy lines: one at 384 keV (10% of the time) and a very prominent one at **861 keV** (90% of the time).\n    *   **pp-III chain:** Produces \"⁸B\" (Boron-8) neutrinos. These have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays, which have continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These are a minor contribution in the Sun compared to the pp-chain.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:**\n    The problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means the production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases**. The effect is observed on Earth now, as the 8.5-minute travel time has passed. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n3.  **Examine the Energy Bands:**\n    We need to compare the neutrino flux in two specific energy windows:\n    *   **Band 1:** 700 keV to 800 keV\n    *   **Band 2:** 800 keV to 900 keV\n\n4.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Band (After the Change):**\n    Let's see which reactions contribute to each band *after* the pp-III branch (and thus the ⁸B neutrinos) has been turned off.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos (max 420 keV): No contribution.\n        *   ⁷Be neutrinos (lines at 384 keV and 861 keV): No contribution.\n        *   ⁸B neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV): **Gone**, as this reaction has stopped.\n        *   CNO neutrinos (¹³N and ¹⁵O): Yes, their continuous spectra pass through this range.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only remaining source of neutrinos is the CNO cycle. In the standard solar model, the CNO contribution is very small.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos: No contribution.\n        *   ⁷Be neutrinos: **Yes, a very strong, sharp line at 861 keV.** This reaction is part of the pp-II branch, which is unaffected.\n        *   ⁸B neutrinos: **Gone**.\n        *   CNO neutrinos (¹³N and ¹⁵O): Yes, their continuous spectra also pass through this range.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is dominated by the massive contribution from the 861 keV ⁷Be line, with a very small additional contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    We need to calculate the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\n    *   Flux (Band 1) ≈ Flux from CNO\n    *   Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux from ⁷Be (861 keV line) + Flux from CNO\n\n    By consulting a standard solar neutrino spectrum graph, we can see that the flux of the ⁷Be line is about two orders of magnitude (or ~100 times) greater than the flux from the continuous CNO spectrum in the same energy region.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio is approximately:\n    Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (Small CNO Flux) / (Large ⁷Be Flux)\n\n    This ratio will be a small number, much less than 1. Let's quantify it:\n    Let F_CNO be the flux from CNO in this region.\n    Let F_Be be the flux from the ⁷Be line.\n    We know F_Be >> F_CNO. In fact, F_Be ≈ 100 * F_CNO.\n\n    Ratio ≈ F_CNO / (F_Be + F_CNO) ≈ F_CNO / F_Be ≈ 1 / 100 = 0.01.\n\n    The flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) becomes virtually zero, while the flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) remains very high due to the unaffected ⁷Be neutrinos. The ratio of a very small number to a very large number is a very small number, close to 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
