    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of total energy. In a relativistic system with a potential energy field, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the relativistic energy of the particle and its potential energy. The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $mc^2$ is the rest energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$) to be zero.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude:**\n    The mass reaches its maximum amplitude at $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    So, the total energy of the system can be calculated at this point:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    Since energy is conserved, this value of $E_{total}$ is constant throughout the entire oscillation.\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Speed:**\n    The speed of the mass is maximum, $v = v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$. This is because at $x=0$, the potential energy is minimum ($U(0) = 0$), and all the stored potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.\n    At $x=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies:**\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n    Energy at $x=A$ = Energy at $x=0$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    We can solve the above equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$, to find $v_{max}$.\n    First, let's rearrange the formula to solve for $v$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Now, substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(\\gamma_{max})^2}}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
