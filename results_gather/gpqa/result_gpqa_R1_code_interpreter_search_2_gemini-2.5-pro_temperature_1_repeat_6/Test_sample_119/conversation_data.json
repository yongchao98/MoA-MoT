    "Here is the reasoning process to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n\n### 1. Define the relationship between distance and parallax\n\n*   Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star.\n*   The formula is: `d = 1 / plx`\n    *   Here, we assume distance `d` is measured in parsecs and parallax `plx` is measured in arcseconds.\n\n### 2. Define the assumption of uniform distribution\n\n*   The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant throughout space.\n*   The number of stars (N) in a given volume (V) is `N = ρ * V`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell\n\n*   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find the number of stars (dN) located in a small parallax interval between `plx` and `plx + d(plx)`.\n*   This parallax interval corresponds to a thin spherical shell in space. Let's find the volume of this shell (dV).\n*   The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3) * π * d³`.\n*   The volume of a thin shell of thickness `dd` at a distance `d` is the derivative of the volume with respect to the radius, multiplied by the thickness:\n    `dV = (d/dd * V) * dd = 4 * π * d² * dd`\n*   The number of stars (dN) in this shell is the density multiplied by the shell's volume:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n\n### 4. Convert the expression from distance to parallax\n\n*   We need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`. We have two variables to convert: `d` and `dd`.\n    1.  **Convert `d`:** Since `d = 1/plx`, then `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    2.  **Convert `dd`:** We need to find the relationship between the differential thickness `dd` and the differential parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n*   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n### 5. Combine the terms to find the final relationship\n\n*   Now, substitute the parallax-based expressions for `d²` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (d²) * (|dd|)`\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n### 6. Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax\n\n*   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n*   From the equation above, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n*   Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
