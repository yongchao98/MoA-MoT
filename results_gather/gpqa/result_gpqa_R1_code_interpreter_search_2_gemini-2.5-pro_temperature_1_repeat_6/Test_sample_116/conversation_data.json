    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls and allenes). Let's analyze each given compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls have two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   At the ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'), there are bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a specific, twisted conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   The resulting molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism and exists as two enantiomers (R-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and S-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is not optically active and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (trans configuration).\n    *   The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the double bond).\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active. (Note: It is a geometric isomer, or diastereomer, of dimethyl maleate, but it is not chiral itself).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
