    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   Conversion from Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    *   T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is significantly higher than that of normal water (0 °C) but is very close to the melting point of heavy water, deuterium oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is an unstable deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. For example: M(OD)ₓ → M₂Oᵧ + D₂O.\n    *   Since the reaction products contain deuterium (in D₂O), and substance X is known to contain a heavier isotope, it is highly likely that this heavier isotope is deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   The reaction producing G (a deuteroxide) and releasing B (D₂O) from G implies that the liquid Y is also a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The gas W is released from the reaction of X with Y (D₂O). The molecule of W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's consider the reaction: X + D₂O → G + W. Since X is a deuterated compound reacting with D₂O, a likely gaseous product is deuterium gas, D₂.\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A deuterium molecule (D₂) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons and neutrons is equal.\n    *   This confirms that **W is D₂ gas**.\n    *   The reaction is therefore: X + D₂O → Metal deuteroxide(s) + D₂. This type of reaction, which is violent and produces hydrogen (or deuterium) gas, is characteristic of active metal hydrides (or deuterides) reacting with water (or heavy water).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue from organic chemistry is crucial. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has the general formula R-CO-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (-CO-) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to alcohol groups (-CH(OH)- and -CH₂(OH) respectively). The overall transformation is R-CO-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH).\n    *   This dual reduction requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The clue \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common laboratory reducing agents.\n    *   Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common, strong reducing agent capable of this transformation. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is milder and would typically only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid intact, resulting in a product with 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, Substance **X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Verify with all Clues:**\n    *   X = LiAlD₄. It contains the heavier isotope D. (Checks out)\n    *   The reaction with Y (D₂O) is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4 D₂ (gas W).\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. (Checks out)\n    *   Gas W is D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons). (Checks out)\n    *   Precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. (Checks out)\n    *   Heating G: 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B). (Checks out)\n    *   Melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent. (Checks out)\n    *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes present.\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen):** It is present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are 4 deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum):** It is present as the isotope ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is 1 aluminum atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
