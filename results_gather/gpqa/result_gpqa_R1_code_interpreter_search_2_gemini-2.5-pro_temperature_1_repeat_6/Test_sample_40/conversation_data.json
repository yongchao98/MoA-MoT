    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **S' (Glass Frame):** This is the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S, in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocity of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n    *   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`.\n    *   Solving for `u'`, the speed of light in the glass as measured in its own rest frame S', we get `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    *   To find the speed of light as observed in the laboratory frame (S), we need to use Einstein's velocity addition formula. This formula correctly combines velocities in special relativity.\n    *   The formula for adding two velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   Here:\n        *   `u` is the velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (what we want to find).\n        *   `u'` is the velocity of the light beam relative to the moving glass (`u' = 1/n`).\n        *   `v` is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n        *   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum (`c = 1`).\n\n4.  **Substitute the Values and Simplify**\n    *   Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To get rid of the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n        `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n        `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n        `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
