    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n\n*   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n*   Its mass is M, and its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let's convert this to MeV for convenience, as the options are in MeV: `300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`.\n\n**2. Understand the Final State and Fission Process**\n\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nLet's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300,000 MeV = 99,000 MeV`\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after. The energy \"lost\" from the rest-mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This released kinetic energy is called the Q-value.\n    `Q = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    `Q = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `Q = 300,000 MeV - (198,000 MeV + 99,000 MeV)`\n    `Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`\n    This Q-value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3,000 MeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The total momentum of the fragments must also be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1_rel`**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nAlso, the total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc^2`.\nCombining these, we get: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nExpanding this gives `T^2 + 2Tmc^2 + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, which simplifies to `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe have two unknowns (`T1`, `T2`) and need a second equation, which is the energy conservation equation: `T2 = Q - T1`. Substitute this into the momentum equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2*c^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = Q^2 - 2QT1 + T1^2 + 2Q*m2*c^2 - 2*T1*m2*c^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out. Now, we solve for `T1`:\n`2*T1*m1*c^2 + 2QT1 + 2*T1*m2*c^2 = Q^2 + 2Q*m2*c^2`\n`T1 * (2*m1*c^2 + 2*m2*c^2 + 2Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n`T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q))`\n\nThe term `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q` is simply the initial energy `Mc^2`. So:\n`T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * Mc^2)`\n\nNow, plug in the values (all in MeV):\n`T1_rel = (3000 * (3000 + 2 * 99000)) / (2 * 300000)`\n`T1_rel = (3000 * (3000 + 198000)) / 600000`\n`T1_rel = (3000 * 201000) / 600000`\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1_cl`**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom conservation of momentum `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n`2 * m1 * T1_cl = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`\n`m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`\n\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`:\n`(2*m2) * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`\n`2 * T1_cl = T2_cl`\nThis shows the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy, which is expected.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation: `T1_cl + T2_cl = Q`.\n`T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = Q`\n`3 * T1_cl = Q`\n`T1_cl = Q / 3 = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T1_rel` - `T1_cl`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in MeV.\nMc2 = 300 * 1000\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Q-value is the total kinetic energy released.\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment).\n# The derived formula is T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2).\nT1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# Classical calculation for T1.\n# The derived formula is T1_cl = Q / 3.\nT1_cl = Q / 3\n\n# Calculate the difference.\ndifference = T1_rel - T1_cl\n\nprint(f\"{difference}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.0\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define and Quantify Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is given as `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. For convenience, we'll convert this to MeV, since the answer options are in MeV: `Mc^2 = 300 * 1000 MeV = 300,000 MeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's define `m1` as the more massive fragment, so: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find the mass of the larger fragment, `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300,000 MeV = 99,000 MeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy lost from the rest-mass of the system is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This total released kinetic energy is called the Q-value.\n`Q = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n`Q = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300,000 MeV - (198,000 MeV + 99,000 MeV)`\n`Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3,000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero. This means they travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n**5. Calculate `T1` Using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation (`T1_cl`)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2mT`.\nSince the momenta are equal in magnitude:\n`p1^2 = p2^2`\n`2 * m1 * T1_cl = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`\n`(0.66*M) * T1_cl = (0.33*M) * T2_cl`\n`2 * T1_cl = T2_cl`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = Q`\n`T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3000 MeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3000 MeV`\n`T1_cl = 1000 MeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the Correct `T1` Using Relativistic Mechanics (`T1_rel`)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nFrom this, we can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\nSince the total energy is `E = T + mc^2`, we have `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nAgain, since `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*m1c^2 = T2_rel^2 + 2*T2_rel*m2c^2`\n\nWe use the energy relation `T2_rel = Q - T1_rel` and substitute it into the equation:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*m1c^2 = (Q - T1_rel)^2 + 2*(Q - T1_rel)*m2c^2`\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*m1c^2 = Q^2 - 2QT1_rel + T1_rel^2 + 2Q*m2c^2 - 2*T1_rel*m2c^2`\n\nThe `T1_rel^2` terms cancel. Now we rearrange to solve for `T1_rel`:\n`2*T1_rel*m1c^2 + 2QT1_rel + 2*T1_rel*m2c^2 = Q^2 + 2Q*m2c^2`\n`T1_rel * (2*m1c^2 + 2*m2c^2 + 2Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)`\n`T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)) / (2 * (m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q))`\n\nWe know that `m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q = Mc^2` (from conservation of total energy). So the denominator simplifies:\n`T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)) / (2 * Mc^2)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values (all in MeV):\n`T1_rel = (3000 * (3000 + 2 * 99000)) / (2 * 300000)`\n`T1_rel = (3000 * (3000 + 198000)) / 600000`\n`T1_rel = (3000 * 201000) / 600000`\n`T1_rel = 201000 / 200`\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cl`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in MeV.\nMc2 = 300 * 1000  # Initial rest-mass energy\n\n# Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M --> m1 = 0.66 * M, m2 = 0.33 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# The Q-value is the total kinetic energy released, which is the \"lost\" rest-mass energy.\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) using the relativistic formula.\n# The derived formula is T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2).\nT1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using the classical approximation.\n# In the classical limit, T1_cl/T2_cl = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n# Since T1_cl + T2_cl = Q, we have T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q, so T1_cl = Q / 3.\nT1_cl = Q / 3\n\n# Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values.\ndifference = T1_rel - T1_cl\n\nprint(f\"{difference}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.0\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution.\n\n### 1. Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   `m₁ = 2 * m₂` (one fragment is twice as massive).\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M` (the sum of fragment masses).\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Masses and Q-value\n\nFrom the relations above, we can solve for `m₁` and `m₂` in terms of `M`:\n*   `(2m₂) + m₂ = 0.99M`  => `3m₂ = 0.99M` => `m₂ = 0.33M`\n*   `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 0.66M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300,000 MeV = 99,000 MeV`\n\nThe **Q-value** is the total kinetic energy released, which is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energy:\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300,000 - (198,000 + 99,000) = 3,000 MeV`\n*   This energy is shared between the fragments: `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3,000 MeV`.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum\n\nThe initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `p₁ = p₂`.\n\n### 4. Classical Kinetic Energy (`T₁_cl`)\n\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy `T = p² / (2m)`. Since `p₁ = p₂`:\n*   `2m₁T₁_cl = 2m₂T₂_cl` => `m₁T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl`\n*   `(0.66M)T₁_cl = (0.33M)T₂_cl` => `2T₁_cl = T₂_cl`\n*   Substitute this into the energy equation: `T₁_cl + 2T₁_cl = Q`\n*   `3T₁_cl = 3,000 MeV` => `T₁_cl = 1,000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T₁_rel`)\n\nIn relativity, the energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where total energy `E = T + mc²`. This gives `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\nSince `p₁ = p₂`:\n*   `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   Substitute `T₂ = Q - T₁`:\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = (Q - T₁)² + 2(Q - T₁)m₂c²`\n*   Expanding and simplifying this equation (as shown in the detailed reasoning) leads to the formula:\n    `T₁_rel = (Q * (Q + 2m₂c²)) / (2 * Mc²)`\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    `T₁_rel = (3000 * (3000 + 2 * 99000)) / (2 * 300000)`\n    `T₁_rel = (3000 * 201000) / 600000`\n    `T₁_rel = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. The Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_rel - T₁_cl` = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
