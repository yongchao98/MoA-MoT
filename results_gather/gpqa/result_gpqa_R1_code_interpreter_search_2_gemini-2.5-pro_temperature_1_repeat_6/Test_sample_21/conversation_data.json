    "E1. **Analyze the first part of the statement: Thermodynamics**\n\n*   The statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n*   The thermodynamic strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n*   We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l). The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq). The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\n*   Comparing the two values, +1.23 V is significantly more positive than +0.40 V. This means that oxygen has a much stronger thermodynamic driving force to be reduced (and thus act as an oxidant) in acidic solution than in basic solution.\n*   Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to its behavior in acidic solutions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the statement: Kinetics**\n\n*   The statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n*   Kinetics refers to the rate of a reaction. The reaction in question is the reduction of oxygen.\n*   The overall reduction of O₂ to H₂O (in acid) or OH⁻ (in base) involves the transfer of four electrons. The direct transfer of four electrons in a single step is highly improbable and thus kinetically very slow.\n*   The O=O double bond in the oxygen molecule is very strong (bond energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol), which contributes to a high activation energy for its reactions.\n*   This high activation energy makes the reduction of oxygen kinetically slow under standard conditions, regardless of whether the solution is acidic or basic. Even though the thermodynamic driving force is stronger in acidic solution (E° = +1.23 V), the reaction pathway has a high kinetic barrier.\n*   This kinetic inertness is why, for example, many materials that are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of air (like many metals) do not corrode or combust spontaneously. A catalyst or higher temperature is often required to overcome this kinetic barrier.\n*   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions (and in general at room temperature without a catalyst).\n\n3.  **Combine the findings**\n\n*   First blank: **weaker**\n*   Second blank: **slower**\n\n*   This corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) stronger – slower\nB) stronger – faster\nC) weaker - slower\nD) weaker – faster\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
