    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100% to 32%, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%)).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's verify the molecular formula and weight for the options. The general formula for the options is C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35.5) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This matches the observed molecular ion peak.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an acid chloride and would lack the O-H peak. It also makes option B (an aldehyde with a phenol group) less likely, as the combined IR signature would be different.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. It is a singlet ('s') because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the presence of a -COOH group.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry split their neighbors on the other side, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group attached to a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Final Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid and would not have a proton signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data:\n    *   **MS:** MW=156, contains one Cl. ✓\n    *   **IR:** Has a carboxylic acid group. ✓\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a carboxylic acid proton at ~11 ppm and the characteristic two-doublet pattern of a *para*-substituted ring. ✓\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. The IR and NMR data do not match.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
