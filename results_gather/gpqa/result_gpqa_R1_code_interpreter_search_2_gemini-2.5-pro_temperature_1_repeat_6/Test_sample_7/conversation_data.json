As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each gene from the single mutant data.**\n    *   Wild-type control has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to resistance, but its loss is not catastrophic. It is responsible for about 25% of the resistance effect.\n    *   `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function leads to a complete loss of resistance. This suggests G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. This means G3 also contributes significantly to resistance, more so than G1. It is responsible for about 50% of the resistance effect.\n\n2.  **Analyze the double mutants to understand gene interactions.** This is where we look for epistasis and other relationships. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, implying the epistatic gene acts upstream in a pathway.\n    *   `g1g2` has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This means G2 likely acts upstream of G1.\n    *   `g2g3` has 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This means G2 also likely acts upstream of G3.\n    *   Combining these findings, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream. G2 fits this description perfectly. It acts as a master switch; if it's off (mutated), it doesn't matter what state G1 and G3 are in, as they are not activated. So, we can conclude that **G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the `g1g3` double mutant.**\n    *   `g1g3` has 10% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype is not the same as `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%), so neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other in the classical sense. They must function in a different relationship.\n    *   Let's consider if their effects are additive. The loss from g1 is 25%, and the loss from g3 is 50%. An additive effect would result in a total loss of 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance is 10%, which is much lower than the expected 25%. This indicates a **synergistic interaction**. The loss of both genes has a much greater effect than the sum of their individual losses. This type of interaction is characteristic of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform a similar or parallel function. When one is lost, the other can partially compensate, but when both are lost, the function is almost completely abolished. G1 and G3 work in parallel, downstream of G2, to create the full resistance phenotype.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options based on the conclusions.**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct, based on our analysis of epistasis.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct, this explains the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g1` (75%). However, the first two statements are strongly supported by the data.\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the TF.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: We cannot conclude this. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but we only have data for one trait (resistance). This is an unsupported claim.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a plausible molecular mechanism for co-regulation by G2, but it is an inference, not a direct conclusion from the phenotypic data. \"Gene redundancy\" is a better description of the observed genetic interaction itself.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g3` (50%).\n\n5.  **Final Decision.** Option A provides the most accurate description. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly interprets the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. Despite the third clause being incorrect, the first two clauses are the most important and accurate conclusions derived from the experimental data, making it the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
