    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high value suggests the proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen (deshielding effect).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one adjacent, non-equivalent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for vinylic protons. J-coupling constants for protons across a double bond are stereochemically dependent:\n        *   *trans* coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically large (12-18 Hz).\n        *   *cis* coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) is typically smaller (6-12 Hz).\n    *   **Conclusion for Signal 1:** This is a vinylic proton in a *trans* configuration relative to another vinylic proton.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'd' means it's coupled to one proton (likely the one at 7.0 ppm), and the 'q' means it's coupled to three equivalent protons (likely a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion for Signal 2:** This is a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton and a methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH₃-C=O), as found in an acetate functional group.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion for Signal 3:** This indicates the presence of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning these three equivalent protons are coupled to one adjacent proton (likely the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Conclusion for Signal 4:** This indicates a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's piece the fragments together based on the coupling information:\n\n*   From signal 3, we have an acetate group: **-O-C(=O)-CH₃**.\n*   The other signals describe the rest of the molecule. We have a vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm, another vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm, and a methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n*   The vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to both the other vinylic proton (d) and the methyl group (q). This means it's in the middle: **CH₃-CH=CH-**.\n*   The methyl group at 1.6 ppm is coupled to the proton at 5.5 ppm, confirming the **CH₃-CH** linkage.\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is only coupled to the proton at 5.5 ppm, meaning it's at the end of the chain.\n\nCombining these pieces, the basic structure is **CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃**, which is **propenyl acetate**. The butenyl acetate structures are ruled out because they would have different numbers of protons and/or different splitting patterns (e.g., an ethyl group or a CH₂ group signal).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the geometry around the double bond. As established in the analysis of Signal 1, the coupling constant between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large value is characteristic of a **trans** arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
