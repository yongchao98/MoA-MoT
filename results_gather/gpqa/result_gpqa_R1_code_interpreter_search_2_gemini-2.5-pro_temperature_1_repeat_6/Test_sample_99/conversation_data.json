    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify the compounds A through H.\n\n1.  **Compound A (C3H6):** The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane. The reaction with Br2 in CCl4 is a characteristic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Therefore, compound A is an alkene. The only alkene with this formula is **propene** (CH3-CH=CH2).\n\n2.  **Compound B:** Propene (A) undergoes bromination, which is an electrophilic addition reaction across the double bond.\n    `CH3-CH=CH2 (Propene) + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)`\n    Compound B is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n3.  **Compound C:** Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This reagent is used for dehydrohalogenation (elimination of HBr). Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    `CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O`\n    Compound C is **propyne**.\n\n4.  **Compound D:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic polymerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form a substituted benzene ring.\n    `3 CH3-C≡CH --(Red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene`\n    Compound D is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**, which is also known as **mesitylene**.\n\n5.  **Compound E:** Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The methyl groups are ortho-, para-directing and activating. In mesitylene, the 2, 4, and 6 positions are equivalent and activated.\n    `1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O`\n    Compound E is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene** (or nitromesitylene).\n\n6.  **Compound F:** Compound E (nitromesitylene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    `2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + Fe/HCl --> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O`\n    Compound F is **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**, also known as **mesidine** or **2,4,6-trimethylaniline**.\n\n7.  **Compound G:** Compound F (mesidine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures (0-5 °C). This reaction converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    `Mesidine + HNO2 --(0-5°C)--> Mesitylenediazonium salt`\n    Compound G is **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n8.  **Compound H:** Compound G (diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide or is warmed with water. The diazonium group (-N2+) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    `Mesitylenediazonium salt + H2O/NaOH --> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol + N2 + Salt`\n    Compound H is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline). Aromatic amines are key starting materials for the synthesis of azo dyes. Mesidine can be diazotized (forming G) and then coupled with another aromatic compound to produce dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the three protons on the aromatic ring (at positions 2, 4, 6) are chemically equivalent and do not have any adjacent protons, so they appear as one singlet. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent and appear as another singlet. Therefore, its 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**C) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). It is a gas at standard temperature and pressure (boiling point: -23.2 °C) and, like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically yielding a violet, purple, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored [Fe(OAr)6]3- complex. However, this reaction is susceptible to steric hindrance. In 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is flanked by two bulky methyl groups in the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with the ferric ion. As a result, no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution remains the yellow-brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. Stating that it \"gives a yellow color\" implies a positive test result, which is not the case. The test is considered negative. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
