    "An analysis of the \"impulse approximation\" and the provided statements leads to the following reasoning:\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Impulse Approximation:** The core idea of the impulse approximation in nuclear physics is to simplify a complex many-body problem (a probe interacting with a nucleus) into a much simpler two-body problem (the probe interacting with a single, free nucleon). This approximation is typically valid for high-energy interactions where the interaction time is very short compared to the characteristic time of nucleons moving within the nucleus.\n\n2.  **Evaluating each assumption:**\n    *   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational premise of the approximation. We are deliberately choosing to ignore more complex interactions where the probe might interact with a pair of nucleons simultaneously (these are known as two-body currents or meson-exchange currents). By assuming the interaction is with only one nucleon, we isolate a single constituent as the target. This is essential.\n\n    *   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This relates to what happens *after* the primary interaction. If the struck nucleon or the scattered probe were to interact with other nucleons on their way out of the nucleus (a phenomenon called Final State Interactions or FSI), the measured final state would be distorted. The energy and momentum of the outgoing particles would no longer reflect the initial, simple two-body collision. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we are ignoring FSI. In the simplest form of the theory (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation), this is a key assumption to directly relate the observed final state to the properties of the single nucleon that was struck. This is essential.\n\n    *   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nuclear medium. The impulse approximation is about treating the *nucleon* as a quasi-free particle, regardless of its internal composition. In fact, many experiments that rely on the impulse approximation, such as deep inelastic scattering, operate at very high energies where the quarks are highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary condition for the impulse approximation.\n\n    *   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The approximation assumes the interaction happens so quickly (like a sudden impulse or kick) that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the nuclear potential that binds it. We effectively \"freeze\" the nuclear configuration at the moment of the collision and ignore the binding energy of the struck nucleon during the interaction itself. This is essential.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The impulse approximation is jointly defined by assuming the interaction happens with a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon is effectively unbound during the brief interaction (4), and that the products of this interaction escape the nucleus without further scattering (2). Assumption (3) is unrelated to the core concept.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
