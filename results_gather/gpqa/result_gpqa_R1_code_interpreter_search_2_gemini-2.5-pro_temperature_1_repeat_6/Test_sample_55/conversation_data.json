    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0>. This decay happens via \"two dipole transitions,\" which implies a cascade process: the atom first decays to an intermediate state by emitting a photon, and then this intermediate state decays to the final state by emitting a second photon. A direct single-photon decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition to occur between an initial state |n,l,m> and a final state |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules for the quantum numbers must be satisfied:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1** (The parity of the state must change).\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**.\n*   **Δn = n' - n** can be any integer. For a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so E_n' < E_n, which for hydrogen means n' < n.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n',l',m'>.\n\n*   **First transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   Applying Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n' must be less than 3. The possible values are n'=1 or n'=2.\n    *   However, for n'=1, the only possible value for l' is 0 (since l < n). The state |1,1,m'> does not exist.\n    *   Therefore, the intermediate state must have n'=2.\n    *   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are **|2,1,0>**, **|2,1,1>**, and **|2,1,-1>**.\n\n*   **Second transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Final state: n=1, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states |2,1,m'> is allowed.\n    *   Initial state: n'=2, l'=1.\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0, +1, or -1, which is consistent with our identified intermediate states.\n    *   Therefore, the cascade must proceed via one of these three routes:\n        1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n        3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of that route compared to all other possible routes. Since all three routes end at the same final state |1,0,0>, we need to compare the probabilities of the first step, which determines how the decaying atoms are distributed among the intermediate states.\n\nThe probability (or rate) of a transition from an initial state `|i>` to a final state `|f>` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n`P(i→f) ∝ |<f| **r** |i>|²` where **r** is the position operator.\n\nWe need to calculate the relative probabilities for the transitions from |3,0,0> to each of the three possible intermediate states |2,1,m'>.\n\nThe matrix element `<n'l'm'| **r** |nlm>` can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The radial part, involving the integral over `r`, is the same for all three transitions since `n, l, n', l'` are the same (|3,0> -> |2,1>). Thus, the relative probabilities only depend on the angular part.\n\nLet's analyze the angular integrals for the components of **r** (x, y, z):\n*   **z-component (Δm=0):** The operator is `z = r cos(θ)`. This operator connects states where `Δm = 0`. This corresponds to the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>.\n*   **x, y-components (Δm=±1):** The operators `x = r sin(θ)cos(φ)` and `y = r sin(θ)sin(φ)` connect states where `Δm = ±1`. These correspond to the transitions |3,0,0> → |2,1,±1>.\n\nThe calculation of the squares of the angular matrix elements gives a remarkable result:\n*   `|<2,1,0| z |3,0,0>|² ∝ 1/3`\n*   `|<2,1,1| x |3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,1| y |3,0,0>|² ∝ 1/3`\n*   `|<2,1,-1| x |3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,-1| y |3,0,0>|² ∝ 1/3`\n\nThis shows that the transition probability from the initial state |3,0,0> is **equal** for each of the three possible final states |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, and |2,1,-1>.\n\nThe total probability must sum to 1. Since there are three equally probable channels for the first step, the probability of entering any specific channel is 1/3.\n*   Probability of |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> is 1/3.\n*   Probability of |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> is 1/3.\n*   Probability of |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> is 1/3.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states, it has only one allowed decay path to a lower energy level: the |1,0,0> state (the 2p → 1s transition). Thus, the probability of the second step is 1, conditioned on being in the intermediate state.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the entire cascade following a specific route is simply the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n*   For the route **|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>**, the probability is **1/3**.\n*   For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, the probability is 1/3.\n*   For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, the probability is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3\nB) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3\nC) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4\nD) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
