    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6. The oxygen atom is atom 7, forming the epoxide.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers. A `(1R, 6S)` configuration for a 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system indicates a *cis*-fusion of the epoxide ring to the cyclohexane ring. Let's draw this with the epoxide ring below the plane of the cyclohexane ring (alpha, denoted by dashed lines).\n            *   At C1, there is a methyl group. For C1 to have the `R` configuration, the methyl group must be above the plane (beta, denoted by a wedge).\n            *   At C6, there is a hydrogen. The *cis*-fusion means this hydrogen is also above the plane (beta, wedge), which gives the `S` configuration at C6.\n            *   At C3, for the `R` configuration, the methyl group must be below the plane (alpha, dash).\n            *   At C4, for the `R` configuration, the methyl group must also be below the plane (alpha, dash).\n            *   While there can be ambiguity in determining stereochemistry from 2D drawings, we will proceed with the stereochemical information given in the name.\n\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is a methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The problem provides the key rules for this reaction:\n        1.  The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n        2.  The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** (SN2-like mechanism).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   The less sterically hindered carbon is C6. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration. The epoxide is on the alpha face (down). The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the opposite side, the beta face (up).\n    *   This means the new methyl group at C6 will be on the beta face (up, wedge).\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen, which is attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original epoxide was alpha (down), the resulting -OH group at C1 will also be alpha (down, dash).\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their absolute configurations. The attack at C6 inverts its configuration.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**\n    *   **Structure:** The reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   The original C1, which now has the -OH group, becomes the new C1.\n        *   The original C6, which was attacked by the methyl group, becomes the new C2.\n        *   The numbering proceeds around the ring: C1 → C2(old C6) → C3(old C5) → C4(old C4) → C5(old C3) → C6(old C2).\n        *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n        *   The systematic name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Let's determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each chiral center in the product based on the transformation.\n        *   **C1:** The configuration is retained. The starting material was `1R`. Thus, the product is `1R`.\n        *   **C2 (from old C6):** The configuration is inverted. The starting material was `6S`. Inversion of 'S' gives 'R'. Thus, the product is `2R`.\n        *   **C4 (from old C4):** The configuration is retained. The starting material was `4R`. Thus, the product is `4R`.\n        *   **C5 (from old C3):** The configuration is retained. The starting material was `3R`. Thus, the product is `5R`.\n\n    *   Combining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The predicted product matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
