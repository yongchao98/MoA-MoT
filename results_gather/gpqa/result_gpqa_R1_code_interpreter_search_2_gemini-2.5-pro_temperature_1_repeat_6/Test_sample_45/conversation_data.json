    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -CH₃, -CH₂CH₃, and -CH=CH₂).\n    *   The problem states the reactant is \"racemic,\" which means it is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The catalyst is Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis.\n    *   Since there is only one type of alkene, it will undergo self-metathesis.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products of Self-Metathesis:**\n    *   The general reaction for self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (R'-CH=CH₂) is:\n        2 R'-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R'-CH=CH-R' + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    *   The question asks to exclude ethene. So, we are interested in the product R'-CH=CH-R'.\n    *   In our case, the R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:\n        CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a double bond (at C4) which can have E or Z geometry.\n    *   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) alkenes, three types of pairings can occur in the metathesis reaction:\n        a. (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n        b. (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n        c. (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n4.  **Count the Stereoisomers from Each Pairing:**\n\n    *   **a. (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:** This reaction forms (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The double bond can be E or Z.\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 6R, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        *   Product 2: (3R, 6R, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **b. (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This reaction forms (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The double bond can be E or Z.\n        *   Product 3: (3S, 6S, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of Product 1)\n        *   Product 4: (3S, 6S, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of Product 2)\n\n    *   **c. (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This cross-coupling forms (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of its E and Z isomers.\n        *   **E-isomer:** (3R, 6S, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This molecule possesses a center of inversion (i), which makes it an achiral meso compound.\n            *   Product 5: (3R, 6S, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n        *   **Z-isomer:** (3R, 6S, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This molecule might seem chiral. However, a key point in stereochemistry (often simplified in introductory contexts) is that if a molecule and its mirror image can be given the same IUPAC name by following all priority rules, they are the same achiral compound. The enantiomer of (3R, 6S, 4Z) is (3S, 6R, 4Z). Due to IUPAC naming rules for multiple stereocenters in a symmetrical molecule, (3S, 6R, 4Z) would be renamed to (3R, 6S, 4Z). This indicates the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is also a meso compound.\n            *   Product 6: (3R, 6S, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n5.  **Sum the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    By counting all the distinct stereoisomers formed, we have:\n    *   One pair of enantiomers from the (R,R) and (S,S) couplings with E geometry (Products 1 & 3).\n    *   One pair of enantiomers from the (R,R) and (S,S) couplings with Z geometry (Products 2 & 4).\n    *   One meso compound from the (R,S) coupling with E geometry (Product 5).\n    *   One meso compound from the (R,S) coupling with Z geometry (Product 6).\n\n    The list of unique products is:\n    1.  (3R, 6R, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    2.  (3S, 6S, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    3.  (3R, 6R, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    4.  (3S, 6S, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    5.  (3R, 6S, 4E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    6.  (3R, 6S, 4Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n    In total, there are 6 possible stereoisomeric products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
