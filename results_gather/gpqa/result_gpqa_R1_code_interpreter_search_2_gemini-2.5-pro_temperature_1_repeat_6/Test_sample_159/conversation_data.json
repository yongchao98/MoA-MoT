    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry:**\n    *   The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon.\n    *   A key feature is that all apothems have the same length, 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.\n    *   The problem states that N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   Let's consider what a regular N-sided polygon looks like as N approaches infinity. As the number of sides increases, the polygon becomes smoother and more rounded. In the limit, a regular polygon with an infinite number of sides becomes a circle.\n    *   The apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) becomes the radius of this limiting circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern for a **circular aperture of radius 'a'**.\n\n2.  **Recall Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a characteristic diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern.\n    *   This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The intensity distribution in the far-field is described by the formula:\n        I(θ) = I₀ [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n        where:\n        *   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `k` is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n        *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n        *   J₁ is the Bessel function of the first kind, order one.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   The minima (dark rings) in the diffraction pattern occur where the intensity I(θ) is zero. This happens when the numerator, J₁(k * a * sinθ), is zero (excluding the case where the denominator is also zero, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n    *   So, we need to find the roots (zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x). Let these non-zero roots be u₁, u₂, u₃, ...\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n        k * a * sinθₘ = uₘ\n    *   Substituting k = 2π / λ:\n        (2π / λ) * a * sinθₘ = uₘ\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    *   The problem states that we can assume the angles are small, so sinθ ≈ θ.\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n        (2π / λ) * a * θₘ = uₘ\n    *   Solving for the angular position θₘ:\n        θₘ = uₘ * (λ / (2π * a))\n\n5.  **Find the First Two Minima:**\n    *   We need the values of the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁ Bessel function. From standard tables or a search, these are:\n        *   First zero, u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n        *   Second zero, u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (m=1) is:\n        θ₁ = u₁ * (λ / (2π * a)) ≈ 3.8317 * (λ / (2π * a))\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (m=2) is:\n        θ₂ = u₂ * (λ / (2π * a)) ≈ 7.0156 * (λ / (2π * a))\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    *   Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [u₂ * (λ / (2π * a))] - [u₁ * (λ / (2π * a))]\n    *   Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) * (λ / (2π * a))\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * (λ / (2π * a))\n        Δθ = 3.1839 * (λ / (2π * a))\n    *   Now, we compute the numerical coefficient 3.1839 / (2π).\n\nLet's use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First two non-zero zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, order one (J1).\nu1 = 3.831706\nu2 = 7.015587\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is given by:\n# delta_theta = (u2 - u1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient (u2 - u1) / (2 * pi).\n\ncoefficient = (u2 - u1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\nThe output of the above code is `0.506733...`\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   The calculated angular distance is Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a).\n    *   Let's compare this to the given options:\n        A) 0.500 λ / a\n        B) 0.506 λ / a\n        C) 1.220 λ /a\n        D) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   The calculated value matches option B almost perfectly.\n\n*Note on other options:*\n*   Option D (0.610 λ / a) corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (θ₁ ≈ 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a), not the distance between the first two.\n*   Option C (1.220 λ / a) corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum (2 * θ₁), which is a common value in diffraction problems.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach the shape of a circle as the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. The apothem 'a' of the polygon will become the radius of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This phenomenon is known as Fraunhofer diffraction, and the resulting pattern is an Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nWhere:\n-   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center of the pattern.\n-   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n-   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n-   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n-   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) in the diffraction pattern occur when the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator term, `J₁(k * a * sinθ)`, is equal to zero (excluding the case where the denominator is also zero, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is that the argument of the Bessel function must be equal to the m-th non-zero root (or zero) of the J₁ function. Let these roots be u₁, u₂, u₃, ...\n\nSo, for the m-th minimum:\nk * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ) as stated in the problem, we get:\nk * a * θₘ = uₘ\n\nSubstituting k = 2π/λ:\n(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = uₘ\n\nSolving for the angular position of the m-th minimum, θₘ:\nθₘ = uₘ * (λ / (2π * a))\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the positions of the first minimum (θ₁) and the second minimum (θ₂). These correspond to the first and second non-zero roots of the J₁ Bessel function. From mathematical tables, the first two non-zero roots are:\n-   u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n-   u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum is:\nθ₁ = u₁ / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum is:\nθ₂ = u₂ / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 7.0156 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 λ/a\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁:\nΔθ = (u₂ / (2π) * (λ / a)) - (u₁ / (2π) * (λ / a))\nΔθ = (u₂ - u₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n\nPlugging in the values for u₁ and u₂:\nΔθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value 0.5067 λ/a matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
