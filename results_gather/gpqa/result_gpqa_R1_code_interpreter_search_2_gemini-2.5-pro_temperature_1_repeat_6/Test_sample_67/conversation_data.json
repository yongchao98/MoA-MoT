    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γSz*B`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. To be in the lowest energy state, the particle must have the spin eigenvalue that makes `E` most negative. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy corresponds to the `+ħ/2` eigenvalue.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The new magnetic field is `B' = B * ŷ`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B' = -γSy*B`.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γSy*B)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBSy*t/ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μz`\n\nOur goal is to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`. To do this, we need to see how the state `|ψ(t)>` evolves.\n\n**Method 1: State Vector Evolution in the `Sy` basis**\n\nIt's easiest to work in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates, which are the eigenstates of `Sy`: `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates of `Sy`:**\n    *   `|+y>` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`\n    *   `|-y>` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`\n\n*   **Express the initial state `|+z>` in the `Sy` basis:**\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n*   **Apply the time evolution operator:**\n    The time evolution operator `exp(iγBSy*t/ħ)` is easy to apply to the eigenstates of `Sy`. Let `ω = γB`. This `ω` is the Larmor frequency.\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωSy*t/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iω(ħ/2)*t/ħ) |+y> + exp(iω(-ħ/2)*t/ħ) |-y>]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iωt/2) |+y> + exp(-iωt/2) |-y>]`\n\n*   **Convert back to the `Sz` basis to find `<Sz>`:**\n    We know `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`.\n    Substituting these into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [exp(iωt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iωt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>)]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [(exp(iωt/2) + exp(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iωt/2) - exp(-iωt/2))|-z>]`\n    Using Euler's formulas `cos(x) = (e^ix + e^-ix)/2` and `sin(x) = (e^ix - e^-ix)/(2i)`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n*   **Calculate `<Sz(t)>`:**\n    `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n    `<Sz(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, we get:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos²(ωt/2) - (-ħ/2) * sin²(ωt/2)`\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n*   **Find the oscillation of `<μz(t)>`:**\n    `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    Substituting `ω = γB`:\n    `<μz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe expression for the average z-component of the magnetic moment is a cosine function of time. The term multiplying `t` inside the cosine is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n### 4. Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)\n\nThis result can also be understood classically. A magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ × B`, which causes the angular momentum (and thus the magnetic moment) to precess around the magnetic field vector. The frequency of this Larmor precession is given by `ω = γB`. In our case, the initial magnetic moment is along the Z-axis, and the new magnetic field is along the Y-axis. The moment will start to precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane. Its z-component will oscillate between its maximum value and its minimum value with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBoth the detailed quantum mechanical calculation and the classical analogy lead to the same result. The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
