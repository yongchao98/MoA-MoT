    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, using the provided thermochemical data (enthalpies of atomization and bond energies).\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure and Formula:**\nFirst, we need to parse the condensed structural formula to determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of chemical bond.\n\nThe molecule is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 central Carbon, 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 chain Carbon, 1 methyl group (1 C, 3 H). Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central Carbon, 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms:** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**3. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond:**\nBased on the structure, let's count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them systematically.\n    *   Bonds connecting the main carbon chain: There are 7 carbons in the main chain backbone (`C=C-C-C-C-C=C`). The bonds within this chain are 4 single bonds and 2 double bonds. So, 4 C-C bonds here.\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups (branches):\n        *   The first C has two CH3 groups: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   The fourth C has one CH3 group: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The last C has two CH3 groups: 2 C-C bonds.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 (in chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔHa, compound):**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms.\nΔHa(compound) = Σ (Bond energies of all bonds)\nΔHa(compound) = (No. of C-H × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C × BE(C=C))\n\nGiven values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa(compound) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔHa(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Constituent Elements (ΔHa, elements):**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)) into gaseous atoms (C(g) and H(g)).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe atomization of reactants is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\nΔHa(elements) = (12 × ΔHa(C)) + (22 × ΔHa(H))\n\nGiven values:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔHa(C) = 1000 kJ/mol (for C(s) → C(g)).\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol (for H2(g) → 2H(g)).\nThe enthalpy of atomization for hydrogen (ΔHa(H)) is the energy to form one mole of H(g) from H2(g), which is half the bond energy: ΔHa(H) = BE(H-H) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nΔHa(elements) = (12 × 1000) + (22 × 50)\nΔHa(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n**6. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the Hess's Law cycle relating the elements in their standard state, the compound, and the gaseous atoms.\nΔHf = ΔHa(elements) - ΔHa(compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**7. Convert to the Required Units and Compare with Options:**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n\n*   Calculate the molar mass (M) of C12H22.\n    M = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    M ≈ (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Convert ΔHf to kJ/g.\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 11.44 kJ/g matches option A.\n\n```python\n# A python script to verify the calculation.\n\n# 1.

    "The problem asks for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.**\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Counting atoms:**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2(from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1(from CH3) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2(from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 2*3(from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3(from CH3) + 2 + 1 + 2*3(from (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Counting bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure (`C=C`), so there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** To count the single bonds, we can use the valency of carbon. The total number of bonds formed by 12 carbon atoms (valency 4) should be 12 * 4 = 48. This total must equal twice the number of C-C and C=C bonds plus the number of C-H bonds.\n        Let N_CC be the number of C-C bonds and N_C=C be the number of C=C bonds.\n        Total bonds formed by Carbon = 4 * (No. of C atoms) = 2 * (N_CC + N_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds)\n        4 * 12 = 2 * (N_CC + 2) + 22\n        48 = 2*N_CC + 4 + 22\n        48 = 2*N_CC + 26\n        2*N_CC = 48 - 26 = 22\n        N_CC = 11.\n        Let's re-verify by drawing and counting:\n        CH3-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)-CH3\n        Main chain: C-C=C-C-C-C-C=C-C (9 carbons in this view)\n        This is confusing. Let's count from the structure directly:\n        (CH3)2C=: 2 C-C bonds\n        C=C-C: 1 C-C bond\n        C-C-C: 1 C-C bond\n        C-C(CH3): 1 C-C bond to the chain, 1 C-C bond in the branch\n        C-C-C: 1 C-C bond\n        C-C=C: 1 C-C bond\n        =C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds\n        Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds.\n\nLet's recheck the valency calculation:\n4 * 12 = 2 * (N_CC + N_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds)\n48 = 2 * (9 + 2) + 22\n48 = 2 * (11) + 22\n48 = 22 + 22 = 44. There is a discrepancy. Let's re-examine the structure.\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nCarbons: 1,2(methyls)-3-4-5-6(methyl)-7-8-9,10(methyls) ? No, let's number it properly.\nC1(H3)-C2(C3H3)=C4H-C5H2-C6H(C7H3)-C8H2-C9H=C10(C11H3)(C12H3).\nLet's count bonds again.\nC-H: 3+3+1+2+1+3+2+1+3+3 = 22. Correct.\nC-C single: C1-C2, C3-C2, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, C6-C8, C8-C9, C10-C11, C10-C12, C9-C10. Wait, this numbering is flawed.\nLet's build it:\n`C(CH3)2` -> `C` bonded to two `CH3`. That's 2 C-C bonds.\n`=CH-` -> This `C` is bonded to the previous `C` by a double bond, and to the next `C` by a single bond.\n`-CH2-` -> Bonded to previous and next `C` by single bonds.\n`-CH(CH3)-` -> Bonded to previous and next `C` by single bonds, and to a `CH3` group by a single bond. That's 1 C-C bond.\n`-CH2-` -> Bonded to previous and next `C` by single bonds.\n`-CH=` -> Bonded to previous `C` by a single bond, and to the next `C` by a double bond.\n`=C(CH3)2` -> Bonded to two `CH3` groups. That's 2 C-C bonds.\nLet's trace the chain: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. 7 carbons in the chain, so 6 bonds between them. 2 are double, so 4 are single.\nBranches: (CH3)2 at start (2 C-C), CH3 on 4th C (1 C-C), (CH3)2 at end (2 C-C).\nTotal C-C = 4 (in chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds. The count is correct. Let's re-recheck the valency formula. My previous formula was for acyclic hydrocarbons. Let's re-derive. Sum of valencies = 4 * nC + 1 * nH = 4*12 + 22 = 70. This must equal 2 * (Total bonds). Total bonds = N_CH + N_CC + N_C=C = 22 + 9 + 2 = 33. So 2 * 33 = 66. Where is the discrepancy? The sum of valencies should be 4*nC = 48. Let's re-examine my formula. Oh, the formula is: `4*nC = sum of bonds involving C`. So `4*nC = 2*N_CC + 2*N_C=C + N_CH`.\nLet's try again: `4 * 12 = 2 * 9 + 2 * 2 + 22` -> `48 = 18 + 4 + 22` -> `48 = 44`.\nThis is still wrong. Let me draw the molecule and count carefully.\n```\n      CH3   H         CH3    H          CH3\n       \\   /         /      \\          /\n        C = C — CH2 — C — CH2 — C = C\n       /              |              \\\n     CH3              CH3             CH3\n```\nNumber of C-H bonds = 3+3+1+2+1+3+2+1+3+3 = 22. Correct.\nNumber of C=C bonds = 2. Correct.\nNumber of C-C bonds:\n- Two methyl groups on C1 -> 2 bonds\n- C2-C3 -> 1 bond\n- C3-C4 -> 1 bond\n- C4-C5 -> 1 bond\n- C4-methyl -> 1 bond\n- C5-C6 -> 1 bond\n- C6-C7 -> 1 bond\n- Two methyl groups on C7 -> 2 bonds\nTotal C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\nLet's try the valency check again with N_CC = 10.\n`4 * 12 = 2 * 10 + 2 * 2 + 22` -> `48 = 20 + 4 + 22` -> `48 = 46`. Still a mismatch. This is very confusing. Let's trust the Python code's calculation logic, which uses my initial count, and re-check my manual count one more time.\n\nStructure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nLet's number the main chain carbons:\nC1(CH3)2 = C2H - C3H2 - C4H(CH3) - C5H2 - C6H = C7(CH3)2\nBonds in the chain: C1=C2, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6=C7. That's 4 C-C and 2 C=C.\nBonds to branches:\n- C1 has two CH3 groups: 2 C-C bonds.\n- C4 has one CH3 group: 1 C-C bond.\n- C7 has two CH3 groups: 2 C-C bonds.\nTotal C-C = 4 (chain) + 2 (branch) + 1 (branch) + 2 (branch) = 9.\nOk, the count of 9 C-C bonds seems robust. The valency formula I'm using must be wrong or misremembered. Let's proceed with N_CC = 9.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔHa, compound).**\nThis is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of the molecule.\nΔHa(compound) = (No. of C-C × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H × BE(C-H))\nΔHa(compound) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHa(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the constituent elements (ΔHa, elements).**\nThis is the energy needed to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n12 C(solid) + 11 H2(gas) → C12H22(gas)\nWe need the energy for: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g) and 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g).\nΔHa(elements) = 12 × ΔHa(C) + 11 × BE(H-H)\nΔHa(elements) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHa(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\nUsing a Hess's Law cycle:\nΔHf = ΔHa(elements) - ΔHa(compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 5: Convert the answer to the required units and select the correct option.**\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's convert this to kJ/g.\nMolar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.011) + (22 × 1.008) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nComparing our results with the options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of ~11.44 kJ/g matches option A.\nOur calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol does not match any option directly, but option C has the number 1900, albeit with the wrong units. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\nThe most plausible answer is A. The Python code output confirms these calculations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
