    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is described in the coupled angular momentum basis by the state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This notation tells us:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    We are performing a measurement on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The desired outcome is:\n    *   For the first electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is described in the *uncoupled* basis as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will *always* yield the value $-1\\hbar$.\n    The desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    $L_z |1, -1; 1, -1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n    $= (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar) |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n    $= (-1\\hbar + -1\\hbar) |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n    $= -2\\hbar |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n    The quantum number for the total z-component in the final state is $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}>$, to be in a final state $|\\psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the inner product: $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n    In our case:\n    $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n    To calculate the inner product, we need to express the initial state in the same (uncoupled) basis as the final state. This is done using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1> |1, m_1; 1, m_2>$\n    The probability of finding the system in the specific state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is:\n    $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    In our case:\n    *   $m = -1$ (from the initial state)\n    *   $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ (from the final state)\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n    **Conclusion:** It is impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be measured in a state where the sum of its parts is $-2\\hbar$. The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum forbids this transition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
