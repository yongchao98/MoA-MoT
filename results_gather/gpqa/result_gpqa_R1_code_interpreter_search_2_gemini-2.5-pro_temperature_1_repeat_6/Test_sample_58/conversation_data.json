    "This problem requires us to calculate the pH of a mixture of a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. We will solve this by calculating the moles of each reactant, determining the net reaction, and then calculating the pH based on the final composition of the solution.\n\n### **1. Calculate Initial Moles of Each Species**\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species before any reaction occurs.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl dissociates completely in water (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂ - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely to give two moles of hydroxide ions per mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n### **2. Determine the Net Reaction**\n\nThe neutralization reactions will occur in a specific order: the strong acid will react with the strong base first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    The H⁺ ions from HCl will react with the OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂.\n    H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The limiting reactant is H⁺. All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    The remaining OH⁻ ions will then react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The limiting reactant is CH₃COOH. All 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining (excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Final pH**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the weak base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in determining the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nTo verify the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of excess OH-\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.050\n\n# Total volume in Liters\ntotal_volume = 1.200\n\n# Final concentration of OH-\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=}\")\n```\n```output\npH=12.61978875828732\n```\nThe calculated pH is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Calculate Initial Moles of Each Species**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of acid and base present in the initial solutions.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂ - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it dissociates completely, yielding two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n### **2. Perform Neutralization Reactions**\n\nThe strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining (in excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Final pH**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe code execution confirms this result. The final pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
