    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ₁:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   **λ₂:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam. It represents the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (in this case, the gas molecules).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    For a gas where all particles are identical and in random thermal motion, the formula is modified to account for the relative motion of the particles. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2.\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. If we model the molecules as hard spheres of diameter `d`, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance `d` of each other. The effective target area is therefore a circle of radius `d`, so σ_gg = πd².\n    *   So, **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)**\n\n4.  **Analyze λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    In this case, the electron is a high-speed projectile, and the gas molecules are the targets.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, making them highly relativistic and vastly faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets, and the √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   The electron is effectively a point particle compared to the size of a gas molecule. It will be scattered if it hits the \"target\" area of the molecule.\n    *   The formula is λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg).\n    *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. For a point projectile hitting a spherical target of radius `r` (where r = d/2), the target area is σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4.\n    *   So, **λ₂ = 1 / (n * π * d² / 4) = 4 / (n * π * d²)**\n\n5.  **Compare λ₂ and λ₁:**\n    We now have two expressions:\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n    *   λ₂ = 4 / (n * π * d²)\n\n    Let's find the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n    λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n    So, **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the mean free path for an electron in the gas (λ₂) is significantly *longer* than the mean free path for the gas molecules with each other (λ₁). This is because:\n    a) The effective collision cross-section for a point-like electron hitting a molecule is smaller than for two molecules hitting each other.\n    b) The absence of the √2 factor for the electron-molecule interaction (due to stationary targets) also contributes to a longer MFP.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    Our result is λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁. Let's check the given options:\n    A) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁  (This is true, as 5.66 is greater than 1.22)\n    B) λ₂ < λ₁          (This is false)\n    C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁ (This is false, as 5.66 is not less than 1.22)\n    D) λ₂ = λ₁          (This is false)\n\nThe only conclusion that is consistent with the physical analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
