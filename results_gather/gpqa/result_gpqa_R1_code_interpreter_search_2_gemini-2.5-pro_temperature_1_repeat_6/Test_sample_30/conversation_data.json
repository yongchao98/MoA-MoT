    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first reaction is the nitration of toluene using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an activating group and an ortho-, para-director.\n\nA common misconception is that the para product is the major one due to reduced steric hindrance. However, for the nitration of toluene, there are two available ortho positions versus only one para position. The statistical advantage of the ortho positions outweighs the steric hindrance, making the ortho isomer the major product.\n\n*   Reactant: Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n*   Reaction: Nitration (electrophile is NO2+)\n*   Major Product (Product 1): ortho-nitrotoluene (2-nitrotoluene)\n*   Minor Product: para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\nWe will proceed with the major product, 2-nitrotoluene, for the subsequent reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (2-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a strong oxidizing condition that selectively oxidizes the benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO2) is stable under these conditions.\n\n*   Reactant: 2-nitrotoluene\n*   Reaction: Oxidation of the methyl group\n*   Product (Product 2): 2-nitrobenzoic acid\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (2-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). 2-nitrobenzoic acid is an acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. This is a classic acid-base neutralization reaction. The acidic proton on the carboxylic acid group is removed by the hydroxide ion.\n\n*   Reactant: 2-nitrobenzoic acid\n*   Reaction: Acid-base reaction (deprotonation)\n*   Product (Product 3): 2-nitrobenzoate anion (the sodium salt, sodium 2-nitrobenzoate, will be formed in solution).\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is the 2-nitrobenzoate anion.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n\nNow, we need to identify the symmetry elements of the 2-nitrobenzoate anion to assign its point group.\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO-) at position 1 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 2.\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the sp2 hybridization of the ring carbons and the resonance within the ring, carboxylate group, and nitro group, the molecule is expected to be planar in its lowest energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane that contains all the atoms of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    3.  **Rotation Axes (Cn):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C1). If you try to rotate the molecule, for example by 180°, the positions of the distinct substituents (-COO- and -NO2) will be changed, and the molecule will not superimpose on its original state.\n    4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    5.  **Improper Rotation Axes (Sn):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nSince the molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), it belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) D2h: Requires three perpendicular C2 axes and an inversion center. Incorrect.\nB) C3: Requires a C3 axis. Incorrect.\nC) Cs: Requires a single plane of symmetry. Correct.\nD) C2h: Requires a C2 axis and a perpendicular plane of symmetry. Incorrect.\n\nThe final product, 2-nitrobenzoate, has Cs symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
