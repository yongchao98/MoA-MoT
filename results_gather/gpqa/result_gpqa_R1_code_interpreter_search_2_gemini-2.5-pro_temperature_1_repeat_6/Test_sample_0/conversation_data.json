    "This problem is about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it relates to energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Applying the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   The lifetime (τ) of a quantum state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt). A shorter lifetime means the state exists for a shorter, more defined period, but this leads to a larger uncertainty in its energy.\n    *   This energy uncertainty (ΔE) is often called the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. It's not a perfectly sharp line but has a certain width.\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (their linewidths). If the energy difference is smaller than this, the energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as separate.\n    *   The condition for resolution is: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  We'll use the approximate form of the uncertainty principle: ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    2.  We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of electron-volts-seconds (eV·s) to get the energy in eV directly.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    3.  Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:\n        *   **State 1:** τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n            ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   **State 2:** τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n            ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    4.  Calculate the minimum required energy separation:\n        Minimum Separation ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nLet's perform the calculation using Python.\n\n```python\n# Value of the reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E * tau ~ hbar)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their linewidths.\n# We calculate the minimum required separation.\nmin_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_separation:.4e} eV\")\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): 6.5820e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): 6.5820e-08 eV\nMinimum required energy difference (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.2402e-07 eV\n\n**2. Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   The calculation shows that the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   We need to find an option that is greater than this value. Let's compare this result with the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 1.0 x 10⁻⁸ eV (Too small)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1.0 x 10⁻⁴ eV (Larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 1.0 x 10⁻⁹ eV (Too small)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 1.0 x 10⁻¹¹ eV (Too small)\n\n*   Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is significantly greater than the sum of their natural linewidths.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The core concept here is the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) and the time interval over which the energy is measured (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Lifetime and Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime (τ) of an excited state represents the time uncertainty (Δt). A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy level. Instead, it has an \"energy width\" or uncertainty, ΔE, often called the natural linewidth. We can approximate this relationship as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, the difference in their energies must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). If the energy difference is smaller than this sum, the energy levels will overlap significantly and be indistinguishable.\n    *   Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   **Calculation Steps:**\n    1.  Use the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    2.  Calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) for the first state with lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    3.  Calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) for the second state with lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    4.  Sum these uncertainties (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂) to find the minimum required energy separation.\n    5.  Compare this minimum separation with the given options.\n\n**2. Calculation (as verified by the code output)**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Minimum Separation:**\n    *   The minimum required energy difference is the sum of the uncertainties:\n    *   ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) = 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nTo clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's examine the options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (Too small)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Much larger than the required minimum)\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy separation that is sufficiently large to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>"
