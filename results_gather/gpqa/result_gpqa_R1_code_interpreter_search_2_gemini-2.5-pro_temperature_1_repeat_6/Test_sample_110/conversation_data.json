    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The reaction involves the conjugate addition of a nucleophile (an enolate) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Ketone (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of the ketone, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O at position 1).\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), C5, and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the base will deprotonate C6 exclusively. This is a regioselective deprotonation. The mention of \"steric hindrance\" is relevant because bulky bases like t-BuOK typically favor the less substituted (kinetic) enolate, but here there is no choice.\n    *   The enolate formed has a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt. The attack occurs at the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n5.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated (usually during aqueous workup) to yield the final product. The proton adds to the α-carbon of the original acrylate moiety.\n    *   The new substituent attached to C6 of the ring is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n\n6.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the cyclohexanone skeleton with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and the new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n    *   Let's analyze the names provided in the options. They name the product as an ethyl propanoate derivative.\n        *   Parent chain: Ethyl propanoate (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`).\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (C1). The goal is to give the principal functional group on the ring (the keto group) the lowest possible number.\n        *   **C1:** The point of attachment to the propanoate chain. The original C6 of the ketone is now C1. This carbon has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2:** The carbon with the carbonyl group (C=O). The original C1 of the ketone is now C2.\n        *   **C3:** The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups. The original C2 of the ketone is now C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options **A** and **C**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Solvent/Proton Source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The α-protons of nitroalkanes (protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: `CH₃-CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂`.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of crotononitrile.\n    *   Crotononitrile is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n5.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate carbanion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n\n6.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we follow IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (-CN) has the highest priority and defines the parent chain.\n    *   Parent chain: The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering: Start from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n    *   Substituents: There is a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This is found in options A and C.\n*   The correct name for **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This is found in options C and D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
