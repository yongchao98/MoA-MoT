    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key challenge is to introduce these three groups with the correct regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each group influences the position of subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It is an *activating* group and an *ortho, para-director*. Due to its large size, it often favors substitution at the para position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It is a strongly *activating* group and an *ortho, para-director*.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strongly *activating* group and an *ortho, para-director*. It is a likely precursor to the -OEt group.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A strongly *deactivating* group and a *meta-director*.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strongly *activating* group and an *ortho, para-director*. It is formed by the reduction of a nitro group. When protonated to -NH3+, it becomes a strongly *deactivating meta-director*.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A strongly *deactivating* group and a *meta-director*. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be easily added and later removed (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's plan the synthesis by thinking in reverse from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is most likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting the corresponding phenol with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr) in the presence of a base (like NaOH).\n    *   Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**\n    *   Reaction: `...-OH + NaOH -> ...-O-Na+`, then `...-O-Na+ + EtBr -> ...-OEt` (This corresponds to step **ix) NaOH/EtBr** in the options).\n\n*   **Step Before Last:** How to make 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol? Direct introduction of the three groups is difficult due to conflicting directing effects. A common strategy to introduce an -OH group is via a diazonium salt. This involves converting an amino group (-NH2) to a diazonium group (-N2+) and then hydrolyzing it with hot water/acid.\n    *   Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**\n    *   Reaction: `...-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H3O+/Heat)--> ...-OH` (This corresponds to steps like **v) NaNO2/HCl** and **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat**).\n\n*   **Synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline:** This is the most challenging intermediate. It has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's analyze the options to see how they propose to build this or a related structure.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option step-by-step. All options except D start with the same sequence.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    i) `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene`\n    ii) `Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`\n    iii) `Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> ?`\n    This step (Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline) is highly problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and leading to poor results. Thus, Option D is not a viable high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Options A, B, and C:** They all begin with a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze the sequence presented in Option A, which is the most complete.\n\n    **Analysis of the core strategy in Option A:**\n\n    i) **`Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    ii) **`tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**: Sulfonation. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically less hindered *para* position. This installs a blocking group.\n\n    iii) **`4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`**: Nitration. We have a t-butyl group (o,p-director) at C1 and a sulfonic acid group (m-director) at C4.\n        *   The t-butyl group directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   The sulfonic acid group directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (or 6). This is a powerful strategy to force ortho substitution relative to the t-butyl group.\n        The resulting molecule has substituents at positions 1(tBu), 2(NO2), and 4(SO3H). The relative positions are 1,2,4, not the 1,2,3 required for the final product.\n\n    This seems to be a major flaw. However, let's re-examine the target and the intermediates. It appears there is a misunderstanding in how the synthesis proceeds, or a flaw in the question itself. Let's reconsider the synthesis of `o-tert-butylaniline` as an intermediate, which can be formed from the product of step (iii).\n\n    Let's try a different path using the reagents from the options, which is a known method for preparing ortho-substituted compounds:\n    1. **i) `tert-Butylbenzene`**\n    2. **ii) `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`** (blocking para position)\n    3. **iii) `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`** (forcing nitration at ortho position)\n    4. **viii) `... + dilute H2SO4 / Heat -> o-tert-butylnitrobenzene`** (Desulfonation removes the blocking group).\n    5. **iv) `o-tert-butylnitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> o-tert-butylaniline`** (Reduction of the nitro group).\n    6. **v) `o-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> o-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride`** (Diazotization).\n    7. **vii) `... + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> o-tert-butylphenol`** (Hydrolysis to the phenol).\n\n    Now we have **o-tert-butylphenol**. The remaining steps from option A are **vi) HNO3/H2SO4** and **ix) NaOH/EtBr**.\n    8. **`o-tert-butylphenol + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ?`**: We need to nitrate this phenol. The -OH group is a strong o,p-director, and the -tBu group is also an o,p-director. Nitration will yield a mixture of **2-tert-butyl-4-nitrophenol** and **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. Neither is the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n    **Conclusion so far:** A logical application of the reactions listed does not lead to the specified target isomer. There is likely an error in the question's premise (either the target name or the options).\n\n    **Revisiting the Options as Presented:**\n    Despite the inconsistencies, we must choose the best option. Options B and C have illogical ordering of steps (e.g., trying to reduce a nitro group before it's added). Option D fails on fundamental principles of reactivity. Option A presents the most chemically sophisticated (and plausible, if for a different target) sequence of reactions involving blocking groups and diazonium salt chemistry. The strange sequence might hide a non-obvious rearrangement or reaction, or it contains typos. For example, step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt is not standard. However, among the flawed choices, it represents the most likely intended answer for a complex synthesis problem. If we assume there are typos in the steps or the target molecule, this option contains all the necessary transformations (alkylation, blocking, nitration, reduction, diazotization, group removal/replacement, ether synthesis) that are hallmarks of advanced aromatic synthesis design.\n\nLet's assume the question and Option A are correct as written and there is a very specific, non-obvious reaction occurring. Given the severe flaws in options B, C, and D, option A remains the only possibility, despite the difficulty in rationalizing the outcome. The sequence of introducing functional groups, modifying them, and using blocking/directing groups is most coherently laid out in A, even if the final regiochemistry is questionable under standard assumptions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
