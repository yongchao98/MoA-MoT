    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the addition of a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond of a ketone (butan-2-one). This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n        *   The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻, from NaCN) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃.\n        *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final neutral hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   Reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺). H₃O⁺ (the hydronium ion, typically from adding a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ to water) serves as this proton source.\n        *   The overall reaction is: CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + NaCN + H₃O⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + Na⁺ + H₂O.\n        *   Let's evaluate the options for A:\n            *   **H₃O⁺:** This is a suitable proton source to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n            *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form a different type of addition product (a bisulfite adduct), not a cyanohydrin.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule (the α-hydroxy group and the aromatic part) remains unchanged. This transformation is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the conditions:**\n        *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating. The presence of (H₂O) confirms it's a hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   Reagent **B** acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   Let's evaluate the options for B from the remaining choices (A and B):\n            *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While technically acidic, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under standard conditions. The reaction would be extremely slow or incomplete.\n            *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Heating a nitrile with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ is the standard laboratory method for converting it to a carboxylic acid.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid like HCl to facilitate the hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   For the first reaction, we need **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    *   For the second reaction, we need **B = HCl**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
