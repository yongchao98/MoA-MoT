    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n\n**1. Identify the process and given information:**\n*   Decay process: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n*   The `Pi(+)` is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass of `mu(+)`, `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV.\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass `m_nu * c^2` = 0.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\nThe decay is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n        `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   **Final Energy (`E_final`):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`).\n        `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n        where `E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2` and `E_nu = KE_nu` (since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy).\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        `m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + E_nu`\n        `139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + E_nu`\n        This gives us a relationship for the sum of the kinetic energies:\n        `KE_mu + E_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (`p_initial`):** Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n        `p_initial = 0`\n    *   **Final Momentum (`p_final`):** To conserve momentum, the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        `p_mu = -p_nu`\n        Let `p` be the magnitude of their momentum: `p = |p_mu| = |p_nu|`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe can use a standard formula derived from the conservation laws for a two-body decay of a particle at rest (`A -> B + C`). The total energy of one of the products (e.g., particle B) is given by:\n`E_B = (m_A^2 + m_B^2 - m_C^2) * c^2 / (2 * m_A)`\n\nIn our case, `A = Pi(+)`, `B = mu(+)`, and `C = nu`.\nLet's calculate the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`):\n`E_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2 - m_nu^2) * c^2 / (2 * m_pi)`\nPlugging in the rest mass energy values (in MeV):\n`E_mu = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2 - 0^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n\nWe can use a simple calculation to find the result.\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # in MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # in MeV\nm_nu = 0      # in MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2 - m_nu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# From conservation of energy, the total energy released is m_pi - m_mu\nQ_value = m_pi - m_mu\n# The energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy\nE_nu = Q_value - KE_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE_mu = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE_nu = {E_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe execution of the code will yield the following results:\n```\nKE_mu = 4.12 MeV\nKE_nu = 29.78 MeV\n```\nRounding the neutrino's kinetic energy to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`mu(+)`) is approximately 4.12 MeV.\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (`nu`) is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion into a positive muon and a muon neutrino. We need to find the kinetic energies of the two resulting particles.\n\n**1. Principles and Conservation Laws**\n\nThis is a relativistic two-body decay problem. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`).\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n        `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero.\n        `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`).\n    *   Final Energy (`E_final`): The sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`).\n        `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n        The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (`mc^2`).\n        `E_final = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c^2)`\n    *   Final Momentum (`p_final`): The vector sum of the momenta of the muon (`p_mu`) and the neutrino (`p_nu`).\n        `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n**2. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c^2)`\n    Neutrinos are considered massless in this context (`m_nu = 0`), so their total energy is equal to their kinetic energy (`E_nu = KE_nu`).\n    `139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu`\n    Rearranging gives the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n\nFor the neutrino (`m_nu = 0`):\n`E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`\n`E_nu = p*c`\n\nFor the muon:\n`E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\nSubstitute `p*c = E_nu`:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nFrom energy conservation, we have `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n`(m_pi*c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_nu^2` terms cancel out. Now, we solve for `E_nu` (which is `KE_nu`):\n`2(m_pi*c^2)E_nu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`KE_nu = E_nu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`KE_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`KE_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`KE_nu â‰ˆ 29.8 MeV`\n\nNow, use Equation 1 to find the kinetic energy of the muon:\n`KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - KE_nu`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.8`\n`KE_mu = 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. The provided code output confirms these values more precisely as 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV - This matches our calculation.\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\n<<<A>>>"
