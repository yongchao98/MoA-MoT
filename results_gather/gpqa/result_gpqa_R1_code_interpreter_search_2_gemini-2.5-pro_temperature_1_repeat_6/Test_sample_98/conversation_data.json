    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This means there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is also consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This is a complex splitting pattern. According to the n+1 rule, a proton showing this pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **doublet** (1+1=2).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing the **triplet** (2+1=3).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing the **quartet** (3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **doublet** (1+1=2).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3).\n        *   Another set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another **triplet** (2+1=3).\n\nOur task is to find which of the four given structures would produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structure of Each Option\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons. The key protons will be the methine (CH) protons on the main chain, as they are most likely to have multiple different neighboring groups.\n\n**A) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          C2H5(b') C2H5(a')\n          |        |\n    CH3 - CH2 -- CH --- CH -- COOH\n    (5)   (4)    (3)    (2)   (1)\n```\n*   **H(3):** Coupled to H(2) (1H, doublet), H(4) (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group b' (2H, triplet). This gives a **`dtt`**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **H(2):** Coupled to H(3) (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group a' (2H, triplet). This gives a `dt`.\n*   This structure gives a `dtt` but does not have a proton that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH3   CH3\n      |     |\nHOOC--CH2--CH -- CH -- CH3\n (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)\n```\n*   **H(4):** Coupled to H(3) (1H, doublet) and the methyl protons on C4 (3H... no, coupling is to neighbors). It's coupled to the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet). So, H(4) is coupled to H(3) (1H) and the terminal CH₃ (3H), giving a `dq`.\n*   **H(3):** Coupled to H(2) (2H, triplet) and H(4) (1H, doublet). This gives a `td` (triplet of doublets).\n*   This structure matches neither `dtq` nor `dtt`.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH2 - CH -- CH -- COOH\n    (5)   (4)   (3)   (2)   (1)\n```\n*   **H(3):** Coupled to H(2) (1H, doublet) and H(4) (2H, triplet). This gives a `dt`.\n*   **H(2):** Coupled to H(3) (1H, doublet).\n*   This structure matches neither `dtq` nor `dtt`.\n\n**D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nLet's first establish the structure from the condensed formula. It represents `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. To name it, we find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. Numbering starts from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\nThe parent chain is pentanoic acid, with ethyl groups at positions 3 and 4. The name is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the splitting patterns for the key protons: H(3) and H(4).\n```\n          Et(d') Et(c')\n          |      |\n    HOOC - CH2 - CH(c) - CH(d) - CH3(e)\n     (a)   (b)   (3)      (4)     (5)\n```\n*   **Analyze H(d) (the proton at C4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to H(c) on C3 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (d') (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(d) will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the first signal described.\n\n*   **Analyze H(c) (the proton at C3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to H(d) on C4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH₂ group at C2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (c') (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(c) will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for the second signal described.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid (option D) is the only one that predicts ¹H NMR signals corresponding to both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
