    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of a new C=C double bond.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. This means they are sp² hybridized, not sp³.\n        *   Because there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism. It is a stable, conjugated system.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups. The formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons relative to the adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, C2 is alpha to both C1 and C3.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each carries two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). The driving force for this conversion is the formation of a highly stable aromatic ring.\n        *   Keto form (Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) <=> Enol form (Phloroglucinol)\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: It is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The structure is `CH₃OOC-C(H)=C(H)-COOCH₃` with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups; hence, there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule as a whole possesses a center of symmetry (and a plane of symmetry if considered flat), making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit geometric isomerism, with its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate will not. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
