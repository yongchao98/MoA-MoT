    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is an equilibrium reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The problem gives the formation constant (or stability constant), $K_f$, for this reaction:\n    $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n2.  **Set up the Dissociation Reaction:**\n    We start with a solution of the complex, so it's more intuitive to consider its dissociation, which is the reverse reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Use an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    From the table, at equilibrium:\n    *   $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n    *   $[EDTA^{4-}] = x$\n\n4.  **Apply the Equilibrium Constant:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:**\n    The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make a simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.324 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    So, $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Verify the Approximation:**\n    The calculated value $x = 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, a python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nKf = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: Kf = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# This is a quadratic equation: Kf * x^2 + x - initial_complex_conc = 0\n# a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0\na = Kf\nb = 1\nc = -initial_complex_conc\n\n# Use the quadratic formula to solve for x: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n# Since x must be a positive concentration, we take the positive root\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) in a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is described by the equilibrium:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant, $K_f$, is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$. The expression for $K_f$ is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\nSince we start with the complex, it is more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Setting up the ICE Table:**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are:\n*   $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n*   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n*   $[EDTA^{4-}] = x$\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations back into the formation constant expression:\n$K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option C.\n\nThe Python code execution in the previous step solved the full quadratic equation without approximation and yielded the same result (`6.32e-07`), confirming the validity of our approximation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
