LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes. This reaction pathway retains the stereochemistry of the chiral center. Therefore, to obtain an (R) product, starting material A must have the (R) configuration. This constraint eliminated options B and C.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Reaction B):** The reaction of starting material B with BH₃ produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid to an alcohol, which then cyclizes. This reaction also retains the stereochemistry. Therefore, to obtain an (S) product, starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Applying this to the remaining candidates (A and D) eliminated option A.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only hypothesis that satisfied both constraints was D, where starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe proper starting materials for the two reactions are determined by the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe starting material in the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid monoester. It has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The final products are lactones (cyclic esters).\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule, a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) under acidic workup (H+) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and subsequent cyclization do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (R)-product, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is known for its \"exquisite selectivity\" in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving ester groups unaffected.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. This intermediate, a hydroxy-ester, will then undergo acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not involve the chiral center, so the original stereochemistry is preserved. To yield the (S)-product, `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a breakdown of the reactions based on the established selectivity of the reducing agents:\n\n*   **Reaction A: Starting material A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at the C1 position will remain unchanged. The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** Under acidic conditions (H+), the newly formed hydroxyl group at C5 will attack the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification reaction. This cyclization forms the six-membered ring of the lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product at C4 will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B: Starting material B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group at the C5 position will remain intact. The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    *   **Lactonization:** This intermediate, an alcohol-ester, cannot directly form the desired lactone. However, under the reaction conditions (often involving workup), the ester can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, or transesterification can occur. A more direct pathway involves the initial reduction of the carboxylic acid to the alcohol, followed by an intramolecular transesterification where the newly formed C1-OH attacks the C5-ester carbonyl. This displaces the isobutanol and forms the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction and cyclization steps do not alter the original chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of the product at C4 will be identical to that of the starting material at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two different reducing agents. The starting material in all options is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid, meaning it has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key is how each reducing agent interacts with these two functional groups.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n*   **Reagents**: `LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup (`H+`).\n*   **Product**: `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (an R-lactone).\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  Starting material A, which has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group, is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  The LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    3.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the C3 position (which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product must be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n*   **Reagents**: `BH3` (Borane) followed by an acidic workup (`H+`).\n*   **Product**: `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (an S-lactone).\n*   **Selectivity of BH3**: Borane is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is opposite to that of LiBH4. Borane is commonly used for the selective reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  Starting material B, with its carboxylic acid and ester groups, is treated with BH3.\n    2.  The BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    3.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction pathway also does not affect the original stereocenter at the C3 position. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the starting material. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nThis corresponds to the following selection:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). The specific name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   A \"pyran-2-one\" ring is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (at position 1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds in the ring).\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions specify the stereochemistry as (R) for the first reaction and (S) for the second.\n\nA lactone like this is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The linear precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2OH`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decode this name to determine the structure.\n\n*   \"Pentanoic acid\" indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\" means an ethyl group is at C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" describes a substituent at C5. This is an isobutyl ester group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`.\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has a chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structural Mismatch and Correction**\nThere is a discrepancy. The starting material has the ethyl group at C3, which would lead to a `3-ethyl` lactone. The product is named as a `4-ethyl` lactone. This is a very common type of typo in chemistry problems. The most logical assumption is that the product name has a typo and should be **3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. With this correction, the carbon skeleton of the starting material matches that of the product, and the problem becomes a test of reagent selectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Selectivity of LiBH₄.** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Selectivity of BH₃.** Borane is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it does *not* typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate (`HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Stereochemistry.** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction mechanisms and stereochemistry appears correct. The search results confirm the key selectivities of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH4:** Lithium borohydride is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4. The search results confirm that LiBH4 will reduce the ester group of the starting material, leaving the carboxylic acid available for the subsequent lactonization.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This confirms that in Reaction 2, the carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group to participate in the lactonization.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the reactions is also straightforward.\n*   The reduction of the ester (with LiBH4) or the carboxylic acid (with BH3) occurs at a non-chiral center (C5 or C1, respectively).\n*   The chiral center is at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product).\n*   The subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) is an S_N2-like reaction (nucleophilic acyl substitution) that does not involve the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** To obtain (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must have the (R) configuration. LiBH4 reduces the ester, and the resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes. Thus, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction B:** To obtain (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must have the (S) configuration. BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid, and the resulting hydroxy ester cyclizes. Thus, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches the initial analysis. The correct option is B.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) A = (S), B = (S) -> Incorrect\nB) A = (R), B = (S) -> Correct\nC) A = (R), B = (R) -> Incorrect\nD) A = (S), B = (R) -> Incorrect\n\nThe logic holds. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivations:**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n1.  **Starting Material A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n2.  The starting material is a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n3.  Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n4.  Therefore, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (a 1,5-hydroxypentanoic acid derivative).\n    *   HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n5.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group. This forms a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n6.  The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, directly reflects the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n7.  Thus, starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n1.  **Starting Material B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n2.  The starting material B is also a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n3.  Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n4.  Therefore, BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    *   HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl --(BH3)--> HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl\n5.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the six-membered lactone.\n6.  Again, the reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center. The configuration is retained.\n7.  Therefore, to produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a **lactone**, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   The \"pyran\" part indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at position 2.\n*   The \"tetrahydro\" indicates a saturated ring.\n*   The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4.\n*   The chiral center is at C4, which is bonded to a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different CH2 groups within the ring.\n\nA six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a **5-hydroxy carboxylic acid**. The linear precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's trace the carbon chain:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The carbon chain `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5` and the hydroxyl oxygen form the ring.\n*   The C1 becomes the carbonyl carbon of the lactone (position 2 in IUPAC lactone nomenclature).\n*   The C3 of the acid chain, which is the chiral center, becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization process. An (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form an (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and an (S)-acid will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nStructure: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl groups that can be reduced. The key to solving the problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Selectivity:** When presented with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ is selective for the **ester**. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride (H⁻) to form a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻Li⁺), which is much less electrophilic and resistant to reduction by LiBH₄. The ester group, however, is readily reduced to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged (it is reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. LiBH₄, 2. H⁺)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl carbons, not at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane is a highly selective reagent that reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. BH₃, 2. H⁺)--> `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the final lactone (and isobutanol as a byproduct).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not involve the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. The precursor to our product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone.\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name.

The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nLet's trace the two reaction pathways:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 untouched.\n    `A (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --LiBH₄--> `Intermediate 1 (HO-CH₂-R-COOH)`\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy-acid to form the delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 1` --H⁺--> `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 untouched.\n    `B (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --BH₃--> `Intermediate 2 (iBu-OOC-R-CH₂OH)`\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 2` --H⁺--> `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n\n**Groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n*   G1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   G2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   G3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n*   G4: `-H`\n**CIP Priority Order:** G1 > G2 > G3 > G4. (The ester group outranks the acid group because O-C has priority over O-H).\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1 (A → (R)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 1 (the hydroxy-acid):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOH` (originally G2)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G1)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   Therefore, to get an (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R). To get an (R)-intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n*   Path: `(S)-A` → `(R)-Intermediate 1` → `(R)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2 (B → (S)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 2 (the hydroxy-ester):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOiBu` (originally G1)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G2)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priority order remains the same: New G1' > New G2' > New G3'.\n*   Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   Therefore, to get an (S)-lactone, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   Path: `(S)-B` → `(S)-Intermediate 2` → `(S)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

This molecule has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH4 will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will be deprotonated but not reduced. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will protonate the resulting alkoxide and catalyze an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed alcohol and the carboxylic acid to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material A.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH3\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material B is also 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact.

Thus, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material B.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe search results confirm my initial analysis of the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane reagents are often used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH3 is an electrophilic reducing agent that coordinates to the electron-rich carbonyl oxygen. It is one of the best methods for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH4 is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4.\n\nNow, let's apply this confirmed selectivity to the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH4 → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** A is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu).\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 reacts with the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH3 → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** B is also (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 (originally from the C1 carboxyl group that was reduced) attacks the ester carbonyl at C1 (originally C5) in an intramolecular transesterification. This process forms the lactone and releases isobutanol.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions occur at the functional groups and do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check:\n- Reaction A: (R)-starting material + LiBH4 (ester reduction) -> (R)-lactone.

Correct.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Reaction A with LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is less reactive than LiAlH4 but more reactive than NaBH4. The greater reactivity compared to NaBH4 is due to the Lewis-acidic lithium ion which activates the carbonyl group. Therefore, in the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone. The stereocenter at the ethyl-bearing carbon is not affected during this process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B with BH3**: Borane (BH3) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. While NaBH4 is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, BH3 reduces them rapidly to primary alcohols. In the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, will then undergo intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone. Again, the stereocenter is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nBased on this confirmed selectivity:\n*   Starting material A is treated with LiBH4 (ester reduction) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is treated with BH3 (carboxylic acid reduction) to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, for two different reduction reactions that yield stereoisomeric lactones. The key to solving this lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and how they affect the starting material to form the final product.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the structure of the starting material and the product. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester with a stereocenter at the C-3 position. The product is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester), also with a stereocenter.\n2.  Analyze the first reaction: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of LiBH4. It is known to reduce esters but not carboxylic acids. This reduction would form a hydroxy acid, which upon acidic workup, would cyclize to the lactone. I will assume the stereocenter is not affected during this process (retention of configuration). This will allow me to determine the required stereochemistry of starting material A.\n3.  Analyze the second reaction: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of BH3. It is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids over esters. This would form a hydroxy ester, which cannot directly cyclize to the given lactone. I need to investigate this apparent contradiction. It's possible that under the reaction conditions, a subsequent intramolecular transesterification occurs, or that the selectivity rules have an exception in this specific molecular context. I will search for reactions of dicarboxylic acid monoesters with borane.\n4.  Based on the reaction mechanisms, I will deduce the stereochemistry of B required to produce the (S)-lactone.\n5.  Finally, I will combine the findings for A and B to select the correct option.\n\nMy immediate action will be to search for the selectivity of LiBH4 and BH3 in reducing molecules containing both carboxylic acid and ester functional groups, and the mechanism of lactone formation in these cases.\n\nSkeptic: Your plan is logical, but it hinges on a critical point in step 3 that you've already identified as a potential contradiction.\n1.  The assumption of retention of stereochemistry in the LiBH4 reaction is reasonable, as the reaction center (the ester) is remote from the stereocenter (C-3). Your conclusion for A will likely be correct.\n2.  The major failure point is the BH3 reaction. The primary selectivity of BH3 (reducing the carboxylic acid) leads to an intermediate that does not form the product. You cannot simply assume it reduces the ester instead, just because that would lead to the product. Why would BH3 violate its known selectivity? Is there an intramolecular complex that changes its reactivity? Or does the initially formed hydroxy-ester undergo a rearrangement or a subsequent, non-obvious reaction to form the lactone?\n3.  You also haven't fully considered the stereochemical outcome of the BH3 reaction. While you plan to investigate it, you must be careful not to assume retention or inversion without a clear mechanistic basis. The reaction could be stereospecific, stereoselective, or non-selective.\n4.  Missing facts are crucial here: We need a definitive source on how borane reacts with a compound like 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Does it reduce the ester or the acid? And what is the stereochemical outcome at the C-3 position?\n\nI agree with your proposed action. We must clarify the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monoesters and borane.\n\nDecided next action: Execute the search to clarify the selectivity of these reducing agents.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis and provide the necessary details to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 (LiBH4):** The search results confirm that LiBH4 selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has an ester group and a carboxylic acid group. LiBH4 will reduce the ester at the C-5 position to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will cause an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the C-5 hydroxyl group and the C-1 carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The reaction does not involve the stereocenter at C-3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2 (BH3):** The search results also confirm that borane (BH3) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This contradicts the formation of the specified lactone. If BH3 reduced the carboxylic acid, the product would be a hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`), which cannot form the target lactone. There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement itself. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must find the most plausible intended answer. Let's reconsider the problem. There is no common mechanism by which BH3 would reduce the ester *instead* of the carboxylic acid, nor is there a standard mechanism that would cause inversion at the remote C-3 stereocenter.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premise. It is a chemistry problem, likely from a textbook or exam. These problems sometimes contain errors, but more often, they test a subtle point or expect the student to choose the \"best\" fit among the given options.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and that *both* reactions are intended to proceed via reduction of the ester to form the lactone, but perhaps test knowledge of two different reagents that *could* do this, even if one is unconventional or misrepresented. This is a weak assumption.\n\nA stronger approach is to trust our analysis for Reaction 1, which is based on solid, well-documented chemical principles.\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\nThis eliminates options A and C. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\nNow we must decide between B and D, which only differ in the stereochemistry of compound B.\n*   Option B: B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Option D: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe reaction with B produces the (S)-lactone. If we assume the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration (the most common outcome when the stereocenter is not directly involved), then starting material B must be (S). This would point to option D.\n\nLet's reconsider the BH3 reaction. Is there any way for it to work as written?\n`B + BH3 → (S)-lactone`\nThe only way to get the lactone is to reduce the ester. The only way to get the (S)-lactone (assuming retention) is to start with (S)-B. This leads directly to option D. The entire difficulty lies in the fact that BH3 shouldn't perform this reaction.\n\nGiven the constraints of a multiple-choice question, it is most probable that the question intends for the student to identify the necessary stereochemistry of the starting material to produce the given product, assuming a reaction pathway that leads to the product (even if the reagent specified for that pathway is incorrect). The stereochemical outcome is the core of the question.\n\n*   Reaction A: (R)-starter → (R)-product (retention)\n*   Reaction B: (S)-starter → (S)-product (retention)\n\nThis is the most chemically consistent interpretation of the stereochemistry, despite the error in reagent choice for reaction B.\n\nTherefore:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nSkeptic: I agree with your analysis of the LiBH4 reaction. A is definitively (R). I also agree that the stated reaction with BH3 is incorrect based on its known selectivity. The problem is flawed. However, your conclusion to select an answer by assuming the reaction *does* happen and proceeds with retention of stereochemistry is a pragmatic way to approach a flawed multiple-choice question. The question is likely designed to test the stereochemical relationship between the reactant and product in a lactonization reaction, but mistakenly uses BH3. If we accept this premise, then to get the (S)-lactone, one must start with the (S)-acid. This leads to option D. There is no chemical basis for inversion of configuration, which would be required if B were (R) (Option B). Therefore, D is the most plausible intended answer, despite the chemical inaccuracy of the question's premise for the second reaction.\n\nFinal conclusion reached.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group. It contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).

The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive to LiBH₄.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids to alcohols, being much faster at reducing acids than esters.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is untouched. The resulting intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, cyclizes under acidic workup to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point 3: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities):** We must check if the R/S designation changes due to a change in group priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) around the chiral center.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups on C3 are now: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOH > (2) -CH₂CH₂OH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of any two groups inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group is untouched. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **In Starting Material B:** The priorities are the same as for A: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups on C3 are now: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOiBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂CH₂OH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The relative priority order of the groups has not changed. The highest priority group remains the highest. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes. This reaction pathway retains the stereochemistry of the chiral center. Therefore, to obtain an (R) product, starting material A must have the (R) configuration. This constraint eliminated options B and C.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Reaction B):** The reaction of starting material B with BH₃ produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid to an alcohol, which then cyclizes. This reaction also retains the stereochemistry. Therefore, to obtain an (S) product, starting material B must have the (S) configuration.

It has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The final products are lactones (cyclic esters).\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule, a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) under acidic workup (H+) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and subsequent cyclization do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (R)-product, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is known for its \"exquisite selectivity\" in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving ester groups unaffected.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. This intermediate, a hydroxy-ester, will then undergo acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not involve the chiral center, so the original stereochemistry is preserved. To yield the (S)-product, `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a breakdown of the reactions based on the established selectivity of the reducing agents:\n\n*   **Reaction A: Starting material A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at the C1 position will remain unchanged. The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** Under acidic conditions (H+), the newly formed hydroxyl group at C5 will attack the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification reaction. This cyclization forms the six-membered ring of the lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product at C4 will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B: Starting material B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group at the C5 position will remain intact. The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    *   **Lactonization:** This intermediate, an alcohol-ester, cannot directly form the desired lactone. However, under the reaction conditions (often involving workup), the ester can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, or transesterification can occur. A more direct pathway involves the initial reduction of the carboxylic acid to the alcohol, followed by an intramolecular transesterification where the newly formed C1-OH attacks the C5-ester carbonyl. This displaces the isobutanol and forms the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction and cyclization steps do not alter the original chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of the product at C4 will be identical to that of the starting material at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two different reducing agents. The starting material in all options is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid, meaning it has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key is how each reducing agent interacts with these two functional groups.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n*   **Reagents**: `LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup (`H+`).\n*   **Product**: `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (an R-lactone).\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  Starting material A, which has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group, is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  The LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    3.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the C3 position (which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product must be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n*   **Reagents**: `BH3` (Borane) followed by an acidic workup (`H+`).\n*   **Product**: `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (an S-lactone).\n*   **Selectivity of BH3**: Borane is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is opposite to that of LiBH4. Borane is commonly used for the selective reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  Starting material B, with its carboxylic acid and ester groups, is treated with BH3.\n    2.  The BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    3.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction pathway also does not affect the original stereocenter at the C3 position. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the starting material. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nThis corresponds to the following selection:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). The specific name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   A \"pyran-2-one\" ring is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (at position 1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds in the ring).\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions specify the stereochemistry as (R) for the first reaction and (S) for the second.\n\nA lactone like this is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The linear precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2OH`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decode this name to determine the structure.\n\n*   \"Pentanoic acid\" indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\" means an ethyl group is at C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" describes a substituent at C5. This is an isobutyl ester group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`.\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has a chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structural Mismatch and Correction**\nThere is a discrepancy. The starting material has the ethyl group at C3, which would lead to a `3-ethyl` lactone. The product is named as a `4-ethyl` lactone. This is a very common type of typo in chemistry problems. The most logical assumption is that the product name has a typo and should be **3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. With this correction, the carbon skeleton of the starting material matches that of the product, and the problem becomes a test of reagent selectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Selectivity of LiBH₄.** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Selectivity of BH₃.** Borane is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it does *not* typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate (`HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Stereochemistry.** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction mechanisms and stereochemistry appears correct. The search results confirm the key selectivities of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH4:** Lithium borohydride is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4. The search results confirm that LiBH4 will reduce the ester group of the starting material, leaving the carboxylic acid available for the subsequent lactonization.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This confirms that in Reaction 2, the carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group to participate in the lactonization.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the reactions is also straightforward.\n*   The reduction of the ester (with LiBH4) or the carboxylic acid (with BH3) occurs at a non-chiral center (C5 or C1, respectively).\n*   The chiral center is at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product).\n*   The subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) is an S_N2-like reaction (nucleophilic acyl substitution) that does not involve the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** To obtain (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must have the (R) configuration. LiBH4 reduces the ester, and the resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes. Thus, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction B:** To obtain (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must have the (S) configuration. BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid, and the resulting hydroxy ester cyclizes. Thus, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches the initial analysis. The correct option is B.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) A = (S), B = (S) -> Incorrect\nB) A = (R), B = (S) -> Correct\nC) A = (R), B = (R) -> Incorrect\nD) A = (S), B = (R) -> Incorrect\n\nThe logic holds. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivations:**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n1.  **Starting Material A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n2.  The starting material is a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n3.  Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n4.  Therefore, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (a 1,5-hydroxypentanoic acid derivative).\n    *   HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n5.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group. This forms a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n6.  The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, directly reflects the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n7.  Thus, starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n1.  **Starting Material B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n2.  The starting material B is also a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n3.  Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n4.  Therefore, BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    *   HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl --(BH3)--> HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl\n5.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the six-membered lactone.\n6.  Again, the reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center. The configuration is retained.\n7.  Therefore, to produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a **lactone**, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   The \"pyran\" part indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at position 2.\n*   The \"tetrahydro\" indicates a saturated ring.\n*   The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4.\n*   The chiral center is at C4, which is bonded to a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different CH2 groups within the ring.\n\nA six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a **5-hydroxy carboxylic acid**. The linear precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's trace the carbon chain:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The carbon chain `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5` and the hydroxyl oxygen form the ring.\n*   The C1 becomes the carbonyl carbon of the lactone (position 2 in IUPAC lactone nomenclature).\n*   The C3 of the acid chain, which is the chiral center, becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization process. An (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form an (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and an (S)-acid will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nStructure: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl groups that can be reduced. The key to solving the problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Selectivity:** When presented with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ is selective for the **ester**. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride (H⁻) to form a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻Li⁺), which is much less electrophilic and resistant to reduction by LiBH₄. The ester group, however, is readily reduced to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged (it is reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. LiBH₄, 2. H⁺)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl carbons, not at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane is a highly selective reagent that reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. BH₃, 2. H⁺)--> `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the final lactone (and isobutanol as a byproduct).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not involve the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained.

Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. The precursor to our product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone.\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name. It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nLet's trace the two reaction pathways:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 untouched.\n    `A (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --LiBH₄--> `Intermediate 1 (HO-CH₂-R-COOH)`\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy-acid to form the delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 1` --H⁺--> `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 untouched.\n    `B (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --BH₃--> `Intermediate 2 (iBu-OOC-R-CH₂OH)`\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 2` --H⁺--> `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n\n**Groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n*   G1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   G2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   G3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n*   G4: `-H`\n**CIP Priority Order:** G1 > G2 > G3 > G4. (The ester group outranks the acid group because O-C has priority over O-H).\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1 (A → (R)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 1 (the hydroxy-acid):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOH` (originally G2)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G1)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   Therefore, to get an (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R). To get an (R)-intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n*   Path: `(S)-A` → `(R)-Intermediate 1` → `(R)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2 (B → (S)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 2 (the hydroxy-ester):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOiBu` (originally G1)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G2)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priority order remains the same: New G1' > New G2' > New G3'.\n*   Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   Therefore, to get an (S)-lactone, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   Path: `(S)-B` → `(S)-Intermediate 2` → `(S)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

This molecule has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH4 will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will be deprotonated but not reduced. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will protonate the resulting alkoxide and catalyze an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed alcohol and the carboxylic acid to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material A.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH3\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material B is also 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact. The acidic workup (H+) will then catalyze an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Thus, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material B.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe search results confirm my initial analysis of the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane reagents are often used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH3 is an electrophilic reducing agent that coordinates to the electron-rich carbonyl oxygen. It is one of the best methods for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH4 is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4.\n\nNow, let's apply this confirmed selectivity to the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH4 → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** A is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu).\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 reacts with the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH3 → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** B is also (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 (originally from the C1 carboxyl group that was reduced) attacks the ester carbonyl at C1 (originally C5) in an intramolecular transesterification. This process forms the lactone and releases isobutanol.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions occur at the functional groups and do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check:\n- Reaction A: (R)-starting material + LiBH4 (ester reduction) -> (R)-lactone. Correct.\n- Reaction B: (S)-starting material + BH3 (acid reduction) -> (S)-lactone. Correct.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Reaction A with LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is less reactive than LiAlH4 but more reactive than NaBH4. The greater reactivity compared to NaBH4 is due to the Lewis-acidic lithium ion which activates the carbonyl group. Therefore, in the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone. The stereocenter at the ethyl-bearing carbon is not affected during this process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B with BH3**: Borane (BH3) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. While NaBH4 is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, BH3 reduces them rapidly to primary alcohols. In the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, will then undergo intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone. Again, the stereocenter is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nBased on this confirmed selectivity:\n*   Starting material A is treated with LiBH4 (ester reduction) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is treated with BH3 (carboxylic acid reduction) to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, for two different reduction reactions that yield stereoisomeric lactones. The key to solving this lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and how they affect the starting material to form the final product.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the structure of the starting material and the product. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester with a stereocenter at the C-3 position. The product is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester), also with a stereocenter.\n2.  Analyze the first reaction: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of LiBH4. It is known to reduce esters but not carboxylic acids. This reduction would form a hydroxy acid, which upon acidic workup, would cyclize to the lactone. I will assume the stereocenter is not affected during this process (retention of configuration). This will allow me to determine the required stereochemistry of starting material A.\n3.  Analyze the second reaction: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of BH3. It is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids over esters. This would form a hydroxy ester, which cannot directly cyclize to the given lactone. I need to investigate this apparent contradiction. It's possible that under the reaction conditions, a subsequent intramolecular transesterification occurs, or that the selectivity rules have an exception in this specific molecular context. I will search for reactions of dicarboxylic acid monoesters with borane.\n4.  Based on the reaction mechanisms, I will deduce the stereochemistry of B required to produce the (S)-lactone.\n5.  Finally, I will combine the findings for A and B to select the correct option.\n\nMy immediate action will be to search for the selectivity of LiBH4 and BH3 in reducing molecules containing both carboxylic acid and ester functional groups, and the mechanism of lactone formation in these cases.\n\nSkeptic: Your plan is logical, but it hinges on a critical point in step 3 that you've already identified as a potential contradiction.\n1.  The assumption of retention of stereochemistry in the LiBH4 reaction is reasonable, as the reaction center (the ester) is remote from the stereocenter (C-3). Your conclusion for A will likely be correct.\n2.  The major failure point is the BH3 reaction. The primary selectivity of BH3 (reducing the carboxylic acid) leads to an intermediate that does not form the product. You cannot simply assume it reduces the ester instead, just because that would lead to the product. Why would BH3 violate its known selectivity? Is there an intramolecular complex that changes its reactivity? Or does the initially formed hydroxy-ester undergo a rearrangement or a subsequent, non-obvious reaction to form the lactone?\n3.  You also haven't fully considered the stereochemical outcome of the BH3 reaction. While you plan to investigate it, you must be careful not to assume retention or inversion without a clear mechanistic basis. The reaction could be stereospecific, stereoselective, or non-selective.\n4.  Missing facts are crucial here: We need a definitive source on how borane reacts with a compound like 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Does it reduce the ester or the acid? And what is the stereochemical outcome at the C-3 position?\n\nI agree with your proposed action. We must clarify the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monoesters and borane.\n\nDecided next action: Execute the search to clarify the selectivity of these reducing agents.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis and provide the necessary details to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 (LiBH4):** The search results confirm that LiBH4 selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has an ester group and a carboxylic acid group. LiBH4 will reduce the ester at the C-5 position to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will cause an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the C-5 hydroxyl group and the C-1 carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The reaction does not involve the stereocenter at C-3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2 (BH3):** The search results also confirm that borane (BH3) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This contradicts the formation of the specified lactone. If BH3 reduced the carboxylic acid, the product would be a hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`), which cannot form the target lactone. There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement itself. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must find the most plausible intended answer. Let's reconsider the problem. There is no common mechanism by which BH3 would reduce the ester *instead* of the carboxylic acid, nor is there a standard mechanism that would cause inversion at the remote C-3 stereocenter.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premise. It is a chemistry problem, likely from a textbook or exam. These problems sometimes contain errors, but more often, they test a subtle point or expect the student to choose the \"best\" fit among the given options.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and that *both* reactions are intended to proceed via reduction of the ester to form the lactone, but perhaps test knowledge of two different reagents that *could* do this, even if one is unconventional or misrepresented. This is a weak assumption.\n\nA stronger approach is to trust our analysis for Reaction 1, which is based on solid, well-documented chemical principles.\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\nThis eliminates options A and C. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\nNow we must decide between B and D, which only differ in the stereochemistry of compound B.\n*   Option B: B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Option D: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe reaction with B produces the (S)-lactone. If we assume the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration (the most common outcome when the stereocenter is not directly involved), then starting material B must be (S). This would point to option D.\n\nLet's reconsider the BH3 reaction. Is there any way for it to work as written?\n`B + BH3 → (S)-lactone`\nThe only way to get the lactone is to reduce the ester. The only way to get the (S)-lactone (assuming retention) is to start with (S)-B. This leads directly to option D. The entire difficulty lies in the fact that BH3 shouldn't perform this reaction.\n\nGiven the constraints of a multiple-choice question, it is most probable that the question intends for the student to identify the necessary stereochemistry of the starting material to produce the given product, assuming a reaction pathway that leads to the product (even if the reagent specified for that pathway is incorrect). The stereochemical outcome is the core of the question.\n\n*   Reaction A: (R)-starter → (R)-product (retention)\n*   Reaction B: (S)-starter → (S)-product (retention)\n\nThis is the most chemically consistent interpretation of the stereochemistry, despite the error in reagent choice for reaction B.\n\nTherefore:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nSkeptic: I agree with your analysis of the LiBH4 reaction. A is definitively (R). I also agree that the stated reaction with BH3 is incorrect based on its known selectivity. The problem is flawed. However, your conclusion to select an answer by assuming the reaction *does* happen and proceeds with retention of stereochemistry is a pragmatic way to approach a flawed multiple-choice question. The question is likely designed to test the stereochemical relationship between the reactant and product in a lactonization reaction, but mistakenly uses BH3. If we accept this premise, then to get the (S)-lactone, one must start with the (S)-acid. This leads to option D. There is no chemical basis for inversion of configuration, which would be required if B were (R) (Option B). Therefore, D is the most plausible intended answer, despite the chemical inaccuracy of the question's premise for the second reaction.\n\nFinal conclusion reached.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
