The energy E is defined as E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and each spin (S1, S2, S3) can take a value of +1 or -1. Here, β is the inverse temperature, given by β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we identify all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the corresponding energy for each state. There are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe possible spin configurations and their energies are:\n*   **State 1:** All spins are up (+1, +1, +1).\n    The energy is E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n*   **State 2:** All spins are down (-1, -1, -1).\n    The energy is E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n\nThese two states have the same energy level, E1 = -3J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\nNext, we consider the states where one spin is different from the other two:\n*   **State 3:** (+1, +1, -1). The energy is E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J.\n*   **State 4:** (+1, -1, +1).

Understand the Partition Function**\n\n*   The partition function (Z) is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n*   The formula is: Z = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to find the unique energy levels and their degeneracy (how many states have that same energy). Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` for each.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | Sum (S1S2+S1S3+S2S3) | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice the symmetry. The energy only depends on how many spins are aligned with each other.\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs when one spin is flipped relative to the other two (two are +1 and one is -1, or two are -1 and one is +1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2):\n    *   The term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2 * e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6):\n    *   The term is: 6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6 * e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the terms for all energy levels gives the total partition function:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE) over all possible states of the system.

List all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins with 2 states each, there are 2^3 = 8 total microstates.\n2.  For each microstate, calculate the corresponding energy E.\n3.  Group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n4.  Calculate the partition function by summing the term g * exp(-βE) for each unique energy level, where 'g' is the degeneracy.\n\nThis is a self-contained theoretical problem, so no external search is required. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed method is correct, but it is susceptible to manual calculation errors. There are 8 states, and for each state, three products and a sum must be calculated. A single error in any of these calculations will lead to an incorrect result. For instance, confusing the signs of J or β, or miscalculating the product of spins (e.g., -1 * -1 = -1) are common pitfalls. It is critical to be systematic. Let's double-check the energy calculation for a mixed state, say (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1).\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\nThis seems correct. The key will be to carefully enumerate all 8 states and their energies and then correctly sum them to form the partition function.\n\nDecide: The analytical approach is the correct and only way to solve this problem.

The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, Z = Σ_states exp(-βE).\n\nMy proposed solution path is to:\n1.  List all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins with 2 states each, there are 2^3 = 8 total microstates.\n2.  For each microstate, calculate the corresponding energy E.\n3.  Group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n4.  Calculate the partition function by summing the term g * exp(-βE) for each unique energy level, where 'g' is the degeneracy.\n\nThis is a self-contained theoretical problem, so no external search is required. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed method is correct, but it is susceptible to manual calculation errors. There are 8 states, and for each state, three products and a sum must be calculated. A single error in any of these calculations will lead to an incorrect result. For instance, confusing the signs of J or β, or miscalculating the product of spins (e.g., -1 * -1 = -1) are common pitfalls. It is critical to be systematic. Let's double-check the energy calculation for a mixed state, say (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1).\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\nThis seems correct. The key will be to carefully enumerate all 8 states and their energies and then correctly sum them to form the partition function.\n\nDecide: The analytical approach is the correct and only way to solve this problem. The skeptic's concerns about calculation errors are valid and highlight the need for a careful and systematic execution of the plan. I will create a table to organize the states, energies, and degeneracies to ensure accuracy.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E) | Term in Z |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n| 2 | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 3 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 4 | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 5 | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 6 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 7 | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n\nFrom the table, we can identify two distinct energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is 2.\n2.  **E2 = +J**: This occurs for the other 6 states. The degeneracy is 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the terms for all states:\nZ = (Number of states with E1) * e^(-βE1) + (Number of states with E2) * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * -3J) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D.
