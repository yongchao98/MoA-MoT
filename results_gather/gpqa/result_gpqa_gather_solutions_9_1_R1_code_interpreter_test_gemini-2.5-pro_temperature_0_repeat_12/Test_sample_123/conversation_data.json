The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame, τ_lab, is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Decay in the Lab Frame:** The decay law in the lab frame, as a function of lab time t_lab, is:\n    N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance R = 30 m to the inner walls. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed v is approximately the speed of light, c. The time it takes for them to reach the detector in the lab frame is:\n    t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is the number of particles that have not decayed after the time of flight, divided by the initial number.\n    Fraction (F) = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ))\n    Substituting t_flight ≈ R/c, we get:\n    F = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n6.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let the constant term `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, so it's the same in both scenarios. The equation becomes `F = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        Given: F₁ = 1/3, γ₁ = 20\n        1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        Given: F₂ = 2/3, γ₂ = ?\n        2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\n7.  **Solve for γ₂:**\n    First, let's find the value of K from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n\n    Substitute the value of K we just found:\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    We know that ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2). So:\n    -ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    The negative signs cancel out:\n    ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms:\n    ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\n    γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54.

Understanding Relativistic Particle Decay\n\nThe fraction of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity and exponential decay. Due to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time slower than an observer in a stationary reference frame (like the detector).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t_lab` is the time taken to reach the detector wall in the lab's frame of reference.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `τ` (tau) is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\n\nThe particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `L` (30 m) is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\nSo, the survival fraction formula can be written as:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`ln(N/N₀) = -k / γ`\n`γ = -k / ln(N/N₀)`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Conditions\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₁` = 1/3\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₂` = 2/3\n\nWe can set up a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `k`:\n\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = [-k / ln((N/N₀)₂)] / [-k / ln((N/N₀)₁)]`\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = ln((N/N₀)₁) / ln((N/N₀)₂)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), we can simplify the expression:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3))]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))]`\n\nNow, we use the known values for the natural logarithms of 2 and 3:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.6931\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis result is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the exponential decay of particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by `f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n3.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. So, `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`.\n    This gives us `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of surviving particles is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`.\n    Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the value of `K` we found in step 5 into the equation from step 6.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`.\n8.  **Code the Calculation:** Write a Python script to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem can be solved by relating the fraction of particles reaching the detector\n# to the Lorentz factor and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n# The fraction of particles 'f' that do not decay is given by f = exp(-t / τ_lab),\n# where t is the time in the lab frame and τ_lab is the dilated lifetime.\n# t = R / v ≈ R / c (since particles are ultra-relativistic)\n# τ_lab = γ * τ₀ (where γ is the Lorentz factor and τ₀ is the proper lifetime)\n# So, f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))\n\n# Let's define a constant C = R / (c * τ₀).

The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a certain time is described by the exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame. The connection between the particle's rest frame and the laboratory frame (the detector) is made through the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:**\n    *   In the particle's rest frame, the number of particles remaining after a proper time `t'` is given by:\n        `N(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)`\n        where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame and Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius) to reach the inner wall.\n    *   In the lab frame, the time taken for this journey is `t_lab = R / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", so we can approximate their velocity `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (`t'`). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `t_lab = γ * t'`\n    *   Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey to the detector wall is:\n        `t' = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\n4.  **Combine Decay and Relativity:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the proper time `t'` into the survival fraction equation:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    *   The term `c*τ` is the mean distance a particle travels in its rest frame during its mean proper lifetime. This is a constant property of the particle. Let's call the constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant K:**\n    *   We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    *   Now we need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   Using the same survival equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguish Frames:** It is crucial to correctly distinguish between the proper time `t'` in the particle's rest frame and the observed time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame. The decay law exponent must use the proper time.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the lab-frame travel time.\n*   **Constant Property:** The mean proper lifetime `τ` (and thus the product `c*τ`) is an intrinsic property of the particle type and does not change when the particle's energy (and thus `γ`) changes.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on particle decay. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is extended in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame):\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to travel the radius `R` of the detector at a velocity `v` is:\n\n`t = R / v`\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`, so we can approximate `t ≈ R / c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nThe term `c * τ_proper` is a constant for a given type of particle, representing its mean decay length. Let's call the constant term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the particle's own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their time appears to run slower from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\n*   **Survival Fraction:** A particle \"reaches the detector\" if it survives for the time it takes to travel the radius `R` of the detector. The time of flight in the lab frame (`t_travel`) is:\n    `t_travel = R / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (`f`) is the ratio `N / N₀` after the time `t_travel`. Using the decay law in the lab frame:\n`f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / t_lab_lifetime)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `t_lab_lifetime`, we get the key formula:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\nLet's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = R / (cτ)`, since these values do not change between the two scenarios. The formula simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **2. Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for `K` we found in Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

This law is expressed in terms of the particle's own time, known as the proper time (`t_p`). The formula is:\n        `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n        where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n        This means the time that passes for the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations for the System:**\n    *   The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) in the lab frame.\n    *   Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Now, we can find the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey:\n        `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n    *   Substitute this expression for `t_p` into the decay formula to get the survival fraction `f` as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(- (R / (γ * c)) / τ ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant combines the detector's size and the particle's intrinsic lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The survival equation simplifies to:\n        `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n    *   To solve for `γ`, we can first isolate the constant `K`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n        `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n        `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n    *   Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   We are given:\n        *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plug these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel out:\n        `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Now, we can compute the value of `γ₂` using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n</execute_code>\n<code_output>\n54.18839183013329\n</code_output>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Physics Background**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time t in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius, $R$, in the lab frame is $t_{lab} \\approx R/c$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Formula**\n\nThe fraction of particles, $f$, that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the decay law using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n$f = \\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{lab}$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\gamma \\tau_0}$\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n$\\gamma \\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\tau_0}$\n\nSince $R$, $c$, and $\\tau_0$ are constants for this experiment, the entire right side is a constant. This means the product $\\gamma \\ln(f)$ is constant. We can also write this as $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ being constant.\n\n**3.

This law must account for time dilation, where the particle's internal clock runs slower. The formula is:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    where:\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the detector's frame.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n2.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel from the center to the wall of the spherical detector, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time of flight `t` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c = 30 / c`\n\n3.  **Setting up the Ratios**: Let's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem. The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The survival equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles survive, so `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles survive, so `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknown**: We can solve for `γ₂` by first finding the constant `K` from Scenario 1.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculation**: Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n*   `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\nThe term `c * τ` represents the particle's proper decay length, which is a constant for a given type of particle. Let's call it `L_p`. The formula becomes:\n`f = exp(-d / (γ * L_p))`\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first scenario to find the proper decay length (`L_p`).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * L_p))`\n\nTo solve for `L_p`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * L_p)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / L_p`\n`L_p = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n**Step 2: Use the proper decay length to analyze the second scenario.**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * L_p))`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * L_p)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `L_p` we found in Step 1:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n`ln(2/3) = (-30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n`ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / ln(2/3)`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / -ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 40\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor of approximately 54 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe search results confirm the standard physics principles I used. Specifically:\n\n*   The probability of a particle surviving for a time `t` is given by an exponential decay law.\n*   The lifetime of a moving particle is subject to time dilation, where the lifetime in the lab frame (`T` or `Δt`) is the proper lifetime (`T₀` or `Δt₀`) multiplied by the Lorentz factor γ. The formula is `T = γT₀`.\n*   The survival probability `P(t)` can be written as `exp(-t / (γτ))`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame.\n*   This principle is famously demonstrated by the detection of cosmic-ray muons at the Earth's surface, which would not be possible in such large numbers without the effect of time dilation.\n\nThe problem is a direct application of these confirmed principles. My derivation and calculation are consistent with the physics described in the search results.\n\n**Problem Analysis**\n\n1.  **Fraction of surviving particles (f):** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial number `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`. The fraction is `f = N(t)/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`.\n2.  **Time of flight (t):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  **Lab-frame lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory is increased by the Lorentz factor `γ`. If the proper lifetime (in the particle's own rest frame) is `τ₀`, then the lab-frame lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n4.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting these into the fraction equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's set up the equations for the two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this particle and detector setup.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction `f₁` = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁` = 20\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction `f₂` = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂` = ?\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for `γ₂` by setting the expressions for the constant term `R / (c * τ₀)` equal:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This problem requires us to relate the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. This law is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle itself, known as its proper time (`t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of the laboratory, the time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` is `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    Due to time dilation, the time measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper time experienced by the particle. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n    Therefore, the proper time that passes for the particle during its journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substituting the expression for `t_p` into the decay formula gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n4.  **Use the Two Scenarios to Solve:**\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n\n    Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these into our equation:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    The negative signs cancel out. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or the provided python code executions:\n    ```python\n    import math\n    gamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n    print(gamma_2)\n    ```\n    The output is approximately `54.19`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 40\n    C) 54\n    D) 68\n\n    The value `54.19` is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   It is crucial to use the proper time (`t_p`) in the exponent of the decay law, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   The relationship between lab time and proper time is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, which is the core of the time dilation effect.\n*   The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the intrinsic properties of the particle (its proper lifetime `τ`) do not change between the two experiments. This allows us to solve the problem without knowing these specific values.\n*   A logical check confirms the answer: to have a larger fraction of particles survive (2/3 vs 1/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understanding Relativistic Particle Decay\n\nThe fraction of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity and exponential decay. Due to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time slower than an observer in a stationary reference frame (like the detector).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t_lab` is the time taken to reach the detector wall in the lab's frame of reference.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `τ` (tau) is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\n\nThe particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `L` (30 m) is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\nSo, the survival fraction formula can be written as:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`ln(N/N₀) = -k / γ`\n`γ = -k / ln(N/N₀)`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Conditions\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₁` = 1/3\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₂` = 2/3\n\nWe can set up a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `k`:\n\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = [-k / ln((N/N₀)₂)] / [-k / ln((N/N₀)₁)]`\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = ln((N/N₀)₁) / ln((N/N₀)₂)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), we can simplify the expression:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3))]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))]`\n\nNow, we use the known values for the natural logarithms of 2 and 3:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.6931\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis result is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the exponential decay of particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by `f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n3.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. So, `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`.\n    This gives us `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of surviving particles is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`.\n    Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the value of `K` we found in step 5 into the equation from step 6.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`.\n8.  **Code the Calculation:** Write a Python script to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem can be solved by relating the fraction of particles reaching the detector\n# to the Lorentz factor and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n# The fraction of particles 'f' that do not decay is given by f = exp(-t / τ_lab),\n# where t is the time in the lab frame and τ_lab is the dilated lifetime.\n# t = R / v ≈ R / c (since particles are ultra-relativistic)\n# τ_lab = γ * τ₀ (where γ is the Lorentz factor and τ₀ is the proper lifetime)\n# So, f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))\n\n# Let's define a constant C = R / (c * τ₀).

The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a certain time is described by the exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame. The connection between the particle's rest frame and the laboratory frame (the detector) is made through the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:**\n    *   In the particle's rest frame, the number of particles remaining after a proper time `t'` is given by:\n        `N(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)`\n        where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame and Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius) to reach the inner wall.\n    *   In the lab frame, the time taken for this journey is `t_lab = R / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", so we can approximate their velocity `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (`t'`).

The decay law exponent must use the proper time.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the lab-frame travel time.\n*   **Constant Property:** The mean proper lifetime `τ` (and thus the product `c*τ`) is an intrinsic property of the particle type and does not change when the particle's energy (and thus `γ`) changes.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on particle decay.

Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe mean lifetime `T` in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the time dilation formula:\n`T = γ * τ`\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (cτ)`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the particle's own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their time appears to run slower from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\n*   **Survival Fraction:** A particle \"reaches the detector\" if it survives for the time it takes to travel the radius `R` of the detector. The time of flight in the lab frame (`t_travel`) is:\n    `t_travel = R / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (`f`) is the ratio `N / N₀` after the time `t_travel`. Using the decay law in the lab frame:\n`f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / t_lab_lifetime)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `t_lab_lifetime`, we get the key formula:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\nLet's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = R / (cτ)`, since these values do not change between the two scenarios. The formula simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **2. Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **3.

This law is expressed in terms of the particle's own time, known as the proper time (`t_p`). The formula is:\n        `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n        where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n        This means the time that passes for the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations for the System:**\n    *   The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) in the lab frame.\n    *   Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Now, we can find the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey:\n        `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n    *   Substitute this expression for `t_p` into the decay formula to get the survival fraction `f` as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(- (R / (γ * c)) / τ ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant combines the detector's size and the particle's intrinsic lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The survival equation simplifies to:\n        `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n    *   To solve for `γ`, we can first isolate the constant `K`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n        `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n        `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n    *   Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   We are given:\n        *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plug these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel out:\n        `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Now, we can compute the value of `γ₂` using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n</execute_code>\n<code_output>\n54.18839183013329\n</code_output>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius, $R$, in the lab frame is $t_{lab} \\approx R/c$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Formula**\n\nThe fraction of particles, $f$, that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the decay law using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n$f = \\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{lab}$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\gamma \\tau_0}$\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n$\\gamma \\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\tau_0}$\n\nSince $R$, $c$, and $\\tau_0$ are constants for this experiment, the entire right side is a constant. This means the product $\\gamma \\ln(f)$ is constant. We can also write this as $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ being constant.\n\n**3. Applying the Conditions**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Condition 1:** $\\gamma_1 = 20$, $f_1 = 1/3$\n*   **Condition 2:** $\\gamma_2 = ?$, $f_2 = 2/3$\n\nSince the product $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ is constant, we can set the values from both conditions equal to each other:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**4. Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\nNow, we plug in the known values and solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n$20 \\times \\ln(1 / (1/3)) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1 / (2/3))$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(3/2)$\n\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n\nUsing the output from the code interpreter:\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 54.19$\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem can be solved by using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Particle Survival Equation**: The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the detector's reference frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law must account for time dilation, where the particle's internal clock runs slower. The formula is:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    where:\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the detector's frame.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n2.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel from the center to the wall of the spherical detector, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time of flight `t` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c = 30 / c`\n\n3.  **Setting up the Ratios**: Let's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem. The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The survival equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles survive, so `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles survive, so `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknown**: We can solve for `γ₂` by first finding the constant `K` from Scenario 1.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculation**: Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ. The lab-frame lifetime is `t_lab = γ * t_proper`.\n*   **Decay Length:** The average distance a particle travels before decaying is its velocity multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. For ultra-relativistic particles (v ≈ c), the decay length is `L = c * t_lab = c * γ * t_proper`.\n*   **Survival Probability:** The probability (or fraction) of a particle surviving for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law: `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`, where τ is the proper mean lifetime. This is the exact formula I derived and used.\n\nSome sources mention quantum mechanical corrections and deviations from the simple exponential decay law, especially at very short or very long times. However, the problem is framed as a standard relativity problem, and the provided options are single numerical values, implying that the standard, widely-used formula is expected. The problem states the particles are \"fast-decaying,\" and the survival fractions are significant (1/3 and 2/3), which places us in the exponential decay regime where the standard formula is highly accurate.\n\nThe calculation steps are confirmed to be correct. I will now formulate the final answer based on my initial derivation.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the formula for the survival probability of a relativistic particle, which follows an exponential decay law.\n\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling a distance `d` is given by:\n`f = exp(-d / (γ * v * τ))`\nwhere:\n*   `d` is the distance traveled (the detector radius, 30 m).\n*   `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n*   `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\nThe term `c * τ` represents the particle's proper decay length, which is a constant for a given type of particle. Let's call it `L_p`. The formula becomes:\n`f = exp(-d / (γ * L_p))`\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first scenario to find the proper decay length (`L_p`).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * L_p))`\n\nTo solve for `L_p`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * L_p)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / L_p`\n`L_p = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n**Step 2: Use the proper decay length to analyze the second scenario.**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * L_p))`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * L_p)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `L_p` we found in Step 1:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n`ln(2/3) = (-30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n`ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / ln(2/3)`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / -ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 40\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor of approximately 54 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe search results confirm the standard physics principles I used. Specifically:\n\n*   The probability of a particle surviving for a time `t` is given by an exponential decay law.\n*   The lifetime of a moving particle is subject to time dilation, where the lifetime in the lab frame (`T` or `Δt`) is the proper lifetime (`T₀` or `Δt₀`) multiplied by the Lorentz factor γ. The formula is `T = γT₀`.\n*   The survival probability `P(t)` can be written as `exp(-t / (γτ))`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame.\n*   This principle is famously demonstrated by the detection of cosmic-ray muons at the Earth's surface, which would not be possible in such large numbers without the effect of time dilation.\n\nThe problem is a direct application of these confirmed principles. My derivation and calculation are consistent with the physics described in the search results.\n\n**Problem Analysis**\n\n1.  **Fraction of surviving particles (f):** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial number `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`. The fraction is `f = N(t)/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`.\n2.  **Time of flight (t):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  **Lab-frame lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory is increased by the Lorentz factor `γ`. If the proper lifetime (in the particle's own rest frame) is `τ₀`, then the lab-frame lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n4.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting these into the fraction equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's set up the equations for the two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this particle and detector setup.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction `f₁` = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁` = 20\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction `f₂` = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂` = ?\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for `γ₂` by setting the expressions for the constant term `R / (c * τ₀)` equal:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
