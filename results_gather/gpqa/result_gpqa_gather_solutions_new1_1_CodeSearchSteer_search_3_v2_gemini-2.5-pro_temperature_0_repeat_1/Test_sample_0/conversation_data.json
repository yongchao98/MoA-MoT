The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates a state's lifetime (τ) to its energy uncertainty, or \"width\" (ΔE), by the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\nTo clearly distinguish two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\n\n1.  **Calculate Energy Widths:**\n    *   The energy width of the first state (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) is ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The energy width of the second state (τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s) is ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n2.  **Determine Minimum Separation:**\n    *   The minimum required energy difference is the sum of these widths: ΔE_min = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   The script filters the given options (A: 10⁻⁸, B: 10⁻¹¹, C: 10⁻⁴, D: 10⁻⁹ eV) against this minimum requirement.\n    *   Only option C (10⁻⁴ eV) is greater than the calculated minimum separation of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficient to resolve the two levels.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This concept is rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.

This energy uncertainty (ΔE) is fundamentally linked to the lifetime (Δt) of the state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which can be expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A shorter lifetime leads to a greater uncertainty in energy.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the energy uncertainty for each quantum state.

This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is bounded by the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Terms:**\n    *   **Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a quantum state exists before it decays. In the context of the uncertainty principle, the lifetime of the state is the uncertainty in time, so Δt = τ.\n    *   **Energy Uncertainty (ΔE):** Due to its finite lifetime, a quantum energy level is not perfectly sharp. It has a natural \"width\" or \"spread\" in energy, which is the energy uncertainty ΔE. This is also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   **Resolvability:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two broadened levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy levels with widths ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Notice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (it is a \"broader\" line). This broader line is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n    *   For the two levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths. A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths, but being greater than the dominant (larger) width is a necessary minimum condition.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find the option for the energy difference |E1 - E2| that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This energy separation is large enough for the two broadened energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) is approximately 10⁻⁷ eV.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle\nThe problem requires determining the necessary energy difference to distinguish two quantum states with finite lifetimes. The key physical principle is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. It states that for a quantum state with a lifetime `τ` (which is the uncertainty in time, `Δt`), there is a minimum inherent uncertainty in its energy, `ΔE`. This relationship is given by:\n\n`ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2`\n\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty, `ΔE`, is often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\" of the state. For calculations, we can use the approximation `ΔE ≈ ħ/τ`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State\nWe need to calculate the energy width (`ΔE`) for each of the two states.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ₁` = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty `ΔE₁` ≈ `ħ / τ₁`\n    *   `ΔE₁` ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ₂` = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty `ΔE₂` ≈ `ħ / τ₂`\n    *   `ΔE₂` ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy separation between them must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two broadened energy levels will overlap to the point of being indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (`τ₁` = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (`ΔE₁` ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader energy level is the primary limiting factor for resolving the two states. A common and robust criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths.\n\n*   **Resolution Condition:** `|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)`\n*   `|E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This value is much **greater** than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is equal to 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This value is **smaller** than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is equal to 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This value is **smaller** than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is equal to 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This value is **smaller** than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly option A provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. This large separation ensures that the two broadened energy levels can be clearly resolved. Many of the candidate answers correctly performed the calculation but made an error in mapping the numerical result (10⁻⁴ eV) to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This energy uncertainty is a fundamental consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nAccording to the energy-time uncertainty principle, a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship can be approximated by the formula:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁹ s:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁸ s:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the most significant energy broadening. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), which is the dominant factor. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than this value.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nComparing these options to the required minimum separation of approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV, only 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger. The other options are all smaller than the calculated energy uncertainty of the first state, meaning the energy levels would overlap and be indistinguishable.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in their energy measurements. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. For practical purposes, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) is used as the uncertainty in time (Δt), leading to the relationship ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This ΔE is known as the natural line width of the energy state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty (line width) for each quantum state using the given lifetimes and the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their individual energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the larger of the two widths. In this case, the larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nWe now compare this required energy difference with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which sets a fundamental limit on the precision of a quantum state's energy based on its lifetime.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **Energy Broadening:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) does not have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"broadened\" or uncertain by an amount ΔE. The relationship is given by the uncertainty principle: ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation, we approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n2.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (E2 - E1) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy broadening, so the state with the shorter lifetime will be the dominant factor.\n\n**Pruning the Search Space:**\n\nWe can calculate the minimum required energy separation before checking the options.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   Energy width of state 1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   Energy width of state 2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   Minimum required separation: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ + 0.66 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe required energy difference must be greater than ~7.3 x 10⁻⁷ eV.
