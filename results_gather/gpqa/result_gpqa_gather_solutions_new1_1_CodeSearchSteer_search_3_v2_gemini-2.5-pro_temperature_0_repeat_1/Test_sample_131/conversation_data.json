The `can_form_integrals` function was not robust enough to correctly identify that the aliphatic signals from the compounds in Option D could combine to form the required pattern. Let's re-evaluate the logic manually.\n\n### Summary of Analysis\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation & Pruning:**\n    *   The question states the spectrum has only **singlets** in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** would have an aromatic multiplet, not a singlet. This eliminates options A and B.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene** would have an aliphatic quartet and triplet, not singlets. This eliminates option C.\n    *   This leaves only **Option D** as a viable candidate.\n\n2.  **Verification of Final Candidate (Option D):**\n    *   **Mixture:** A 1:1 mix of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals (around 6.7 ppm):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet integrating to 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n        *   To get two signals in a 1:1 ratio, the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H signal. The mixture's spectrum would then show two singlets, each integrating to 2H. This matches the \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\" constraint.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals (around 2.2 ppm):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet integrating to 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The total aliphatic protons are 12H + 12H = 24H. The required 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   This is achieved if the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are accidentally degenerate, creating a single 6H signal. The three signals in the mixture would then be: the 12H signal (from 1,2,4,5-TMB), the original 6H signal (from 1,2,3,5-TMB), and the new degenerate 6H signal (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This matches the \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\" constraint.\n\nThe script failed to correctly assess the aliphatic signal combination, but the manual logical deduction clearly shows that only Option D can satisfy all the conditions described in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, a thorough analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds is necessary. The key information from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture is the presence of two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (around 2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will result in a single singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce a single singlet in the alkyl region, integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This will lead to two distinct singlets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different chemical environments: the methyl at C2 is unique, the methyl at C5 is unique, and the methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This results in three singlets in the alkyl region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, producing a single singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H), and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair (a second signal, 6H). This gives two singlets in the alkyl region with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in one singlet integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal from the -CH2- groups will be a quartet, and the signal from the -CH3- groups will be a triplet. The problem states all signals in the alkyl region are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options:\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture has two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One from 1,2,3,4- (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5- (1H each). This would result in three signals, which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for its 2 equivalent protons). 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two non-equivalent protons, but the problem states the mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Let's re-examine the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons in different environments, leading to two singlets. If mixed with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has one aromatic singlet, we would expect three aromatic signals in total. However, it is possible that two of these signals overlap. A more likely interpretation is that one of the compounds in the mixture has no aromatic protons. But all listed compounds are C10H14 and are tetramethylbenzenes, so they must have two aromatic protons. Let's reconsider the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) and three sets of methyl protons (C1/C3, C2, C5). This compound alone gives two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets. If we have a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n        *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three signals. This contradicts the data. There must be an error in my initial analysis or the problem description. Let's re-evaluate the number of signals for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons and four methyl groups. Due to its structure, it has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (giving two singlets) and three sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups (a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyls, and two 3H singlets for the other two unique methyls), which gives a 2:1:1 ratio. The spectrum described in the problem (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) perfectly matches the spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, assuming the two aromatic protons have nearly identical integration. The question, however, specifies a 1:1 mixture. Let's assume there is an overlap of signals in the mixture.\n    *   Let's reconsider the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-. This is three signals.\n    *   Let's reconsider the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-. This gives two singlets. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be 2H to 2H, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the aromatic region data.\n        *   Alkyl signals: 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, we would have three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio). This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then for the mixtures proposed in the options. The molecular formula for all candidate compounds is C10H14. The experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 integration ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has two equivalent aromatic protons, which would appear as a single singlet. The four methyl groups are also equivalent, leading to one singlet for all 12 methyl protons.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl signal: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent, resulting in one aromatic singlet. It has three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This leads to three singlets in the alkyl region with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are adjacent and not equivalent, so they would form a system of two doublets, not singlets.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 2 doublets\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The high symmetry makes all four aromatic protons equivalent, producing one singlet. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, but within each ethyl group, the CH2 and CH3 protons are different and couple with each other, resulting in a quartet (for the 4H of the two CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the two CH3 groups).\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (4H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\n\n### Analysis of the Mixtures:\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two aromatic singlets** and **three alkyl singlets**. This immediately eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (which gives doublets) or 1,4-diethylbenzene (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\nLet's evaluate the correct option based on this:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets. Also, in a 1:1 molar mixture, the aromatic proton ratio would be 2H:4H or 1:2, not 1:1.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Both compounds give a single aromatic singlet. Since they are different molecules, these singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 molar mixture, and since each molecule contributes 2 aromatic protons, the integration ratio of the two singlets will be 1:1. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The total signals from the mixture would be the sum of the signals from each component.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: 1 singlet (12H)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   The problem states there are three resulting signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. For a 1:1 mixture, the total alkyl proton integration is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be explained by an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the two non-equivalent 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in three signals for the mixture: one from the 12 methyl protons of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (12H), one from the equivalent methyls at C1 and C3 of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (6H), and one from the combined, overlapping signals of the methyls at C2 and C5 of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (3H + 3H = 6H).\n    *   This combination gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the provided spectral data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound is necessary. The molecular formula for all compounds is C10H14.

This also matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** The presence of 1,4-diethylbenzene would introduce a quartet and a triplet, which contradicts the observation of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This combination would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This does not match.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair of compounds that would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options.

A spectral database shows these at approximately 2.17 ppm and 2.24 ppm.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It has two distinct aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) and three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique).\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, for a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One quartet (4H, -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, -CH3-).

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H (or **1:1**) integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This is inconsistent with the data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair that matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user's question is to identify which pair of compounds from a given list corresponds to a specific 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these aromatic protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three chemically distinct types of alkyl protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these alkyl protons are on carbons that are not adjacent to carbons with protons (e.g., methyl groups attached to the benzene ring or a quaternary carbon).\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons for these three signals.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (two perpendicular planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent and not equivalent.

This does not match the \"all singlets\" observation for the alkyl region. **This compound is eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture:**\nWe have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only possible components are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the data.\n\n**Mixture: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-isomer) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1, which has a total of 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n    *   The integration of the signals must be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now, let's see if the compounds can produce this pattern.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three signals of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n    *   For the mixture to show only three signals, some must overlap. If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are accidentally equivalent (have the same chemical shift), they will appear as a single peak with an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  A signal of **12H** (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        2.  A signal of **6H** (from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        3.  A signal of **6H** (from the combined C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options have this molecular formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds. This means that the total number of protons from each compound is equal in the sample. Since all compounds are C10H14, they each contribute 14 protons.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration for each potential compound. This is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   *Summary for Durene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the symmetry plane). This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n    *   *Summary for Isodurene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, they form an AA' system which appears as a **singlet**. Integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n    *   *Summary for Prehnitene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated immediately**. This rules out option A.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give all singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show at least **four aliphatic singlets** (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nMy plan is to analyze the predicted NMR spectra for each compound and then evaluate each multiple-choice option by combining the spectra for a 1:1 mixture. I will compare these combined spectra to the experimental data to find the correct match.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Options based on the predicted spectra:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this results in **2 singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal corresponds to 2 protons, the integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. In a mixture, this results in **3 singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n    *   This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This does not match the experimental data.\n\nThe only combination that matches the observed NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture and the individual components leads to the identification of the two compounds present. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All options—1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene—fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. A singlet means that all aromatic protons within a single molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The presence of singlets suggests the signals come from methyl (-CH3) groups, as ethyl groups would produce a more complex pattern (a quartet and a triplet). This allows for the exclusion of 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has ethyl groups. This eliminates option D.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Isomer\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This produces **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, yielding **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3, the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This leads to **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would produce five alkyl singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one singlet each, resulting in two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (relative integral 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each with a relative integral of 6H). The combination gives three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would result in four alkyl singlets (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectra for each compound and their mixtures was correct.

It has two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3, leading to two aliphatic singlets.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This isomer has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which should give two aromatic singlets. It has three sets of methyl groups (C1, C3, and the C2/C5 pair), resulting in three aliphatic singlets with a 1:1:2 ratio of protons.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum for this compound would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons.

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H or 1:1). This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1.

This results in two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** It has four non-equivalent methyl groups. This would typically produce four singlets. However, accidental overlap is possible. The problem's data of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio suggests that two of the four methyl groups are coincidentally equivalent in the spectrum, giving a 6H:3H:3H ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6.

In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in a 1:1 mixture would show three singlets with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only mixture that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed that the previous output was correct.

The simplest integer ratio is 2:1:1. **(Match)**\n\nThe combination in option B is the only one that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this could mean each compound provides one type of aromatic proton and has the same number of them, or some other combination that results in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons, all of which are singlets (implying no adjacent protons, characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to other protons).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They should produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three distinct chemical environments: Me(1) and Me(3) are equivalent, Me(2) is unique, and Me(5) is unique. This would result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent to each other. However, they are adjacent (ortho), so they will couple and appear as a **pair of doublets**, not a singlet. This contradicts the problem description. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let's note it would be one signal area integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signal for the -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the signal for the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem's description of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the individual spectra, we can immediately rule out **1,4-diethylbenzene** because it would show triplets and quartets, not just singlets, in the alkyl region. We can also likely rule out **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** because its aromatic protons would produce doublets, not the singlets described in the problem.\n\nThis leaves **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** as the most likely candidates (Option A). Let's test this combination.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three** aromatic signals, which contradicts the data. Even if two signals overlapped, the integration ratios would not be 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider the alkyl region, which is more complex and thus more informative. The required ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nLet's re-examine the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option D), and assume the term \"singlet\" for the aromatic region of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene was a simplification in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   This results in two signals with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n        *   In the mixture, we would see three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that produces the observed integration ratios in both the aromatic (1:1) and alkyl (2:1:1) regions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Data for the Mixture**\n\nThe problem provides the following key pieces of information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate compound to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This results in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This results in **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to split with. This results in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two aliphatic singlets (each 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. C4 is between a methyl group and a hydrogen, while C6 is between two methyl groups.

In a 1:1 mixture, these would appear as **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.

The `can_form_integrals` function was not robust enough to correctly identify that the aliphatic signals from the compounds in Option D could combine to form the required pattern. Let's re-evaluate the logic manually.\n\n### Summary of Analysis\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation & Pruning:**\n    *   The question states the spectrum has only **singlets** in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** would have an aromatic multiplet, not a singlet. This eliminates options A and B.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene** would have an aliphatic quartet and triplet, not singlets. This eliminates option C.\n    *   This leaves only **Option D** as a viable candidate.\n\n2.  **Verification of Final Candidate (Option D):**\n    *   **Mixture:** A 1:1 mix of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals (around 6.7 ppm):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet integrating to 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n        *   To get two signals in a 1:1 ratio, the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H signal. The mixture's spectrum would then show two singlets, each integrating to 2H. This matches the \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\" constraint.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals (around 2.2 ppm):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet integrating to 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The total aliphatic protons are 12H + 12H = 24H. The required 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   This is achieved if the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are accidentally degenerate, creating a single 6H signal. The three signals in the mixture would then be: the 12H signal (from 1,2,4,5-TMB), the original 6H signal (from 1,2,3,5-TMB), and the new degenerate 6H signal (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This matches the \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\" constraint.\n\nThe script failed to correctly assess the aliphatic signal combination, but the manual logical deduction clearly shows that only Option D can satisfy all the conditions described in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, a thorough analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds is necessary. The key information from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture is the presence of two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (around 2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will result in a single singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce a single singlet in the alkyl region, integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This will lead to two distinct singlets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different chemical environments: the methyl at C2 is unique, the methyl at C5 is unique, and the methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This results in three singlets in the alkyl region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, producing a single singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H), and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair (a second signal, 6H). This gives two singlets in the alkyl region with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in one singlet integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal from the -CH2- groups will be a quartet, and the signal from the -CH3- groups will be a triplet. The problem states all signals in the alkyl region are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options:\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture has two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One from 1,2,3,4- (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5- (1H each). This would result in three signals, which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for its 2 equivalent protons). 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two non-equivalent protons, but the problem states the mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Let's re-examine the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons in different environments, leading to two singlets. If mixed with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has one aromatic singlet, we would expect three aromatic signals in total. However, it is possible that two of these signals overlap. A more likely interpretation is that one of the compounds in the mixture has no aromatic protons. But all listed compounds are C10H14 and are tetramethylbenzenes, so they must have two aromatic protons. Let's reconsider the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) and three sets of methyl protons (C1/C3, C2, C5). This compound alone gives two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets. If we have a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n        *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three signals. This contradicts the data. There must be an error in my initial analysis or the problem description. Let's re-evaluate the number of signals for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons and four methyl groups. Due to its structure, it has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (giving two singlets) and three sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups (a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyls, and two 3H singlets for the other two unique methyls), which gives a 2:1:1 ratio. The spectrum described in the problem (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) perfectly matches the spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, assuming the two aromatic protons have nearly identical integration. The question, however, specifies a 1:1 mixture. Let's assume there is an overlap of signals in the mixture.\n    *   Let's reconsider the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-. This is three signals.\n    *   Let's reconsider the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-. This gives two singlets. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be 2H to 2H, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the aromatic region data.\n        *   Alkyl signals: 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, we would have three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio). This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then for the mixtures proposed in the options. The molecular formula for all candidate compounds is C10H14. The experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 integration ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has two equivalent aromatic protons, which would appear as a single singlet. The four methyl groups are also equivalent, leading to one singlet for all 12 methyl protons.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl signal: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent, resulting in one aromatic singlet. It has three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This leads to three singlets in the alkyl region with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are adjacent and not equivalent, so they would form a system of two doublets, not singlets.\n    *   Aromatic signal: 2 doublets\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The high symmetry makes all four aromatic protons equivalent, producing one singlet. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, but within each ethyl group, the CH2 and CH3 protons are different and couple with each other, resulting in a quartet (for the 4H of the two CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the two CH3 groups).\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (4H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\n\n### Analysis of the Mixtures:\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two aromatic singlets** and **three alkyl singlets**. This immediately eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (which gives doublets) or 1,4-diethylbenzene (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\nLet's evaluate the correct option based on this:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets. Also, in a 1:1 molar mixture, the aromatic proton ratio would be 2H:4H or 1:2, not 1:1.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Both compounds give a single aromatic singlet. Since they are different molecules, these singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 molar mixture, and since each molecule contributes 2 aromatic protons, the integration ratio of the two singlets will be 1:1. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The total signals from the mixture would be the sum of the signals from each component.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: 1 singlet (12H)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   The problem states there are three resulting signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. For a 1:1 mixture, the total alkyl proton integration is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be explained by an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the two non-equivalent 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in three signals for the mixture: one from the 12 methyl protons of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (12H), one from the equivalent methyls at C1 and C3 of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (6H), and one from the combined, overlapping signals of the methyls at C2 and C5 of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (3H + 3H = 6H).\n    *   This combination gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the provided spectral data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound is necessary. The molecular formula for all compounds is C10H14. The spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 integration ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and would produce a single signal. The four methyl groups are also equivalent, resulting in another single signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.

The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, but the methyls at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 2 singlets (1H each, for a 1:1 ratio)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 3 singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, and each will show an ethyl quartet-triplet pattern.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1 singlet (4H)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H), not singlets\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options:\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture has two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** The presence of 1,4-diethylbenzene would introduce a quartet and a triplet, which contradicts the observation of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This combination would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This does not match.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair of compounds that would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options.

This results in **two singlets** with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2). The signals are **not singlets**.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate candidates based on the NMR data**\n\nWe can use the provided spectral data as filters to rule out compounds that do not fit.\n\n*   **Filter 1: Alkyl signals are all singlets.**\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet in its alkyl region.

If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are accidentally equivalent (have the same chemical shift), they will appear as a single peak with an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  A signal of **12H** (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        2.  A signal of **6H** (from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        3.  A signal of **6H** (from the combined C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.

Although adjacent, they form an AA' system which appears as a **singlet**. Integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n    *   *Summary for Prehnitene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated immediately**. This rules out option A.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give all singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show at least **four aliphatic singlets** (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nMy plan is to analyze the predicted NMR spectra for each compound and then evaluate each multiple-choice option by combining the spectra for a 1:1 mixture. I will compare these combined spectra to the experimental data to find the correct match.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Options based on the predicted spectra:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this results in **2 singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal corresponds to 2 protons, the integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. In a mixture, this results in **3 singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n    *   This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This does not match the experimental data.\n\nThe only combination that matches the observed NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture and the individual components leads to the identification of the two compounds present. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All options—1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene—fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. A singlet means that all aromatic protons within a single molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The presence of singlets suggests the signals come from methyl (-CH3) groups, as ethyl groups would produce a more complex pattern (a quartet and a triplet). This allows for the exclusion of 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has ethyl groups. This eliminates option D.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Isomer\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This produces **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, yielding **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3, the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This leads to **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would produce five alkyl singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one singlet each, resulting in two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (relative integral 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each with a relative integral of 6H). The combination gives three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would result in four alkyl singlets (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectra for each compound and their mixtures was correct. The search results confirm the predicted number of signals for each isomer.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it shows one singlet for the two aromatic protons and one singlet for the four equivalent methyl groups.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry, resulting in one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-5 and H-6). It has two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3, leading to two aliphatic singlets.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This isomer has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which should give two aromatic singlets. It has three sets of methyl groups (C1, C3, and the C2/C5 pair), resulting in three aliphatic singlets with a 1:1:2 ratio of protons.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum for this compound would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**Analysis of the Mixture:**\n\nThe problem states the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture has:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on this:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H or 1:1). This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would produce three singlets in the aromatic region (one from 1,2,3,4- and two from 1,2,3,5-), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would also result in three aromatic singlets (one from 1,2,4,5- and two from 1,2,3,5-), contradicting the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the only mixture that is consistent with the provided 1H NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6), which do not have adjacent protons to couple with. This results in two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** It has four non-equivalent methyl groups. This would typically produce four singlets. However, accidental overlap is possible. The problem's data of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio suggests that two of the four methyl groups are coincidentally equivalent in the spectrum, giving a 6H:3H:3H ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6. They are chemically equivalent to each other but are adjacent, which should result in a coupled system (a doublet or multiplet). However, for highly symmetric molecules, this can sometimes appear as a singlet. Spectral data confirms one aromatic signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The four methyl groups form two equivalence sets: (the outer methyls at 1 and 4) and (the inner methyls at 2 and 3). This results in two singlets, each integrating to 6 protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups produce a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n**Evaluation of the Mixture Options:**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in a 1:1 mixture would show three singlets with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only mixture that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed that the previous output was correct. The code successfully identified the pair of compounds and the corresponding option.\n\n**Summary of the Verification:**\n\n1.  **Target Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic: 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n2.  **Candidate Spectra:**\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), non-singlet aliphatic signals.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Each compound contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. **(Match)**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The mixture combines the signals from both compounds.\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: one singlet (12H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   Total: Three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The simplest integer ratio is 2:1:1. **(Match)**\n\nThe combination in option B is the only one that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this could mean each compound provides one type of aromatic proton and has the same number of them, or some other combination that results in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons, all of which are singlets (implying no adjacent protons, characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to other protons).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They should produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three distinct chemical environments: Me(1) and Me(3) are equivalent, Me(2) is unique, and Me(5) is unique. This would result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent to each other. However, they are adjacent (ortho), so they will couple and appear as a **pair of doublets**, not a singlet. This contradicts the problem description. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let's note it would be one signal area integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signal for the -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the signal for the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem's description of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the individual spectra, we can immediately rule out **1,4-diethylbenzene** because it would show triplets and quartets, not just singlets, in the alkyl region. We can also likely rule out **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** because its aromatic protons would produce doublets, not the singlets described in the problem.\n\nThis leaves **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** as the most likely candidates (Option A). Let's test this combination.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three** aromatic signals, which contradicts the data. Even if two signals overlapped, the integration ratios would not be 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider the alkyl region, which is more complex and thus more informative. The required ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nLet's re-examine the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option D), and assume the term \"singlet\" for the aromatic region of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene was a simplification in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   This results in two signals with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n        *   In the mixture, we would see three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that produces the observed integration ratios in both the aromatic (1:1) and alkyl (2:1:1) regions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
