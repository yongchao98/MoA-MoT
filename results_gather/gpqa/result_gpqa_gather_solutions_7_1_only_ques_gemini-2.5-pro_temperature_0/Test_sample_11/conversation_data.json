Understand the Physics**\nThe decay of a stationary particle (pion, π⁺) into two other particles (muon, μ⁺, and a neutrino, ν) is described.\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is at rest. Its total energy is its rest energy, and its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The two product particles, the muon and the neutrino, move off in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Their total energy (including kinetic and rest energy) must equal the initial energy of the pion.\n\n**2. Key Principles**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    *   `p_μ = p_ν = p`\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy equals the final energy.\n    *   `E_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n\n**3. Given Values**\n*   Rest energy of pion (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of muon (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest energy of neutrino (m_νc²): 0 MeV (assumed massless)\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  From the conservation of energy, we have:\n    `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n2.  Using the energy-momentum relation for the products:\n    *   For the massless neutrino: `E_ν = pc`. This energy is purely kinetic, so `KE_ν = pc`.\n    *   For the massive muon: `E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`.\n\n3.  Substitute these into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc`\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to solve for the momentum term, `pc`:\n    `m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`\n\n5.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n\n6.  The `(pc)²` term cancels on both sides. Now, solve for `pc`:\n    `(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)`\n    `pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]`\n\n7.  Plug in the numerical values:\n    `pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]`\n    `pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2`\n    `pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **Neutrino's KE:** Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, `E_ν = pc`.\n        `KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n    *   **Muon's KE:** The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in rest energies: `KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`. This energy is shared between the two products.\n        `KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν`\n        `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle ($\\pi^+$) into two other particles ($\\mu^+$ and $\\nu$). This is a classic example of a two-body decay, which must adhere to two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the total relativistic energy ($E = KE + mc^2$).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Set Up the Equations**\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Rest energy of pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n    *   Rest energy of muon, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n    *   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is 0.\n    *   The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial momentum is zero, the final products must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each product particle be `p`.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion.

Solve for the Unknowns**\n\nWe can combine these equations to solve for the momentum `p` and then the kinetic energies.\n\n1.  Substitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n2.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n3.

Isolate the square root: $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n3.  Expand the left side: $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out.

This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial total energy is its rest energy.\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Rest energy of π⁺ (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of μ⁺ (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum of the system is zero because the pion is at rest.\n*   To conserve momentum, the two product particles (muon and neutrino) must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** E_final = E_μ + E_ν, where E_μ and E_ν are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n*   Therefore: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic, so KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n**5. Solve for the Unknowns**\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations for the momentum and then the kinetic energies.\n\n1.  From energy conservation, express the muon's total energy: E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν.\n2.  Substitute E_ν = pc: E_μ = m_πc² - pc.\n3.  Substitute this expression for E_μ into its own energy-momentum relation:\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  Expand the left side of the equation:\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n5.  The (pc)² term cancels on both sides. Rearrange to solve for pc:\n    2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   Plug in the given values:\n    pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**7. Determine the Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    As established, KE_ν = pc.\n    KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy (KE = E - mc²). We can find it by using the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value).\n    Total KE = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²) - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = (139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV) - 29.78 MeV\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.
